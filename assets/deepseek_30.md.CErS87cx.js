I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who hasn't seen his children??? ?  In Reno, Nevada, Roslyn Tabor is a 30-year-old woman who has just filed for a quickie six-week divorce from her inattentive husband Raymond. After leaving the Washoe County Courthouse, Roslyn ignores Raymond's attempts to talk to her, and meets with her best local friend and landlord, Isabelle Steers, who is also a divorcee. Isabelle takes Roslyn to a bar at Harrah's Reno for drinks to let the reality of her divorce sink in. While there, they meet an aging cowboy named Gaylord 'Gay' Langland and his tow truck driver friend Guido. They invite Roslyn and Isabelle to Guido's old house in the Nevada country to help her forget about the divorce, after Gay tells Roslyn that he is also divorced. They arrive at the unfinished house Guido built for his late wife, who died several years earlier during childbirth. They drink and dance. Roslyn has too much to drink, so Gay drives her home to Reno. Eventually, Roslyn and Gay move into Guido's half-finished house and start to work on it. One day after breakfast, Gay tells Roslyn how he wishes he were more of a father to his own children, whom he has not seen for some years. Later that afternoon, Roslyn and Gay argue when Gay states his intention to find and kill the rabbits which have been eating the vegetable garden they planted outside Guido's house. The answer to this question is:","output":"Langland.

I went to unlock the door and found my key wouldn't go in. I kept trying while my daughter went to get a flashlight. When she returned with it we found somehow the lock had been \\"stuffed\\" with sunflower seed shells. Thinking that one of the neighborhood children had been up to no good, I really didn't give it much consideration. I found all windows were locked up tight. So I returned to the back door. Oh my God, I will never forget the shock of that moment. The house was empty! Other than a few things remaining on the back porch, everything was gone! Then I heard a car pull into the driveway and found two policemen walking up. They inquired why I had broken into the house. They then asked me for proof that I lived at that address, so I asked them to wait a minute while I went to get my rent receipt and identification from inside the house. I explained the matter to them and showed them the door lock. I could tell from their actions and tone of voice that they thought I was breaking into an empty house for somewhere to sleep. I asked a neighbor for the phone number of house owner and the officer made a call. The owner was quite shocked to hear my story. She said that my roommate had been going through an eviction  process with the court when I moved in with her and had lost the case. She had been ordered to move by 10 am on that date. The court order had been issued the same day I had paid her 1/2 of the rent and a deposit of 300,000. The owner was very kind and understanding but there was nothing she could do. The house had been rented already and the people were to move in the following weekend. The officers let me go and I went to gather my girls into the car. They were both exhausted and old.

Designed for use in premium economy and business class, at the flick of a switch, the seat can be transformed from single upright seat, to four-foot 'couch' and even into a full length double bed. It will allow young passengers in premium economy to lie flat, and will stagger seating to avoid the dreaded elbow clash - a very common complaint on long-haul flights. Hong Kong designer James SH Lee of Paperclip Design, came up with the concept, named Butterfly seating, which recently one first prize at IATA's 2014 Passenger Innovation Awards. A business class seat in upright mode. Passengers get a spacious private suite  with a seat plus a side couch and direct aisle access. The idea of Butterfly seating is to allow for individual demand of the cabin on each individual flight - despite the limited space on an aircraft. While only the business class passengers will be able to transform their seats into a full length bed, this is the first time that premium economy travellers will have access to a 'couch' allowing younger passengers the chance to sleep more comfortably. Lee told MailOnline Travel: 'This flexibility allows airlines to make use of resource more efficiently so that the cost is lowered. The layout maximises bed space, with the sleeping surface utilizing nearly every inch of available floor area. 'They can also react to fluctuations much quicker than before, making them much more resilient to the risks of changing market conditions.' 'For passengers this equates to  more stable fares long term, and the flexibility means more options for them. 'In the past if the business class cabin is full, then it's sold out. But with butterfly they can turn some premium economy seats into business class, and vice versa, if there's a need. At 53cm, the seating will be as wide as many current business class seats in a 777 sized cabin. Fliers in business class can transform the seat into a large bed, accommodating various sleeping positions. In premium economy, young passengers will be able to lie flat as their seat can be transformed into a 'couch' The seats will also feature large cocktail trays, seat pockets on the side and an adjustable ottoman. Meanwhile, passengers in business class will be able to transform the seat into one of the largest bed surfaces currently available. At 195.6cm long from top-to-toe, the seat becomes a private suite including a side couch. A graphic shows the conversion from premium economy to business class.  A mechanism that allows flight attendants to flip the window seat over, turning it into a couch. Passengers in Business Class will be able be offered one of the largest surfaces currently available. The designer added: 'Academic research on convertible seating used in European short haul flights shows a 3.3 per cent increase in revenue, which is hugely significant for the airline industry which makes a net profit between zero to four per cent globally.' 'Butterfly helps to extend this benefit to long haul markets,' he said.

They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification.  - The nautilus (from the Latin form of the original Ancient Greek \\"\\", 'sailor') is a pelagic marine mollusc of the cephalopod family Nautilidae, the sole extant family of the superfamily Nautilaceae and of its smaller but near equal suborder, Nautilina.  - Spirula spirula is a species of deep-water squid-like cephalopod mollusk. It is the only extant member of the genus Spirula, the family Spirulidae, and the order Spirulida. Because of the shape of its internal shell, it is commonly known as the ram's horn squid or the little post horn squid. Because the live animal has a light-emitting organ, it is also sometimes known as the tail-light squid.  - Permoceras , the sole member of the Permoceratidae , is a coiled nautiloid with a smooth , compressed involute shell , whorls higher than wide , earlier whorls hidden from view . The venter is rounded as are the ventral and umbilical shoulders , the flanks flattened . The siphuncle is ventrally subcentral . The suture , which is most characteristic , has a deep , narrow pointed ventral lobe and large , asymmetrical pointed lobes on either side . Permoceras is included in the nautilid superfamily , Trigonocerataceae , and is derived from the Mississippian ( L Carb ) - Triassic Grypoceratidae . Permoceras was first identified in the Lower Permian of Timur in the East Indies and named by Miller and Collinson in 1953 Permoceras almost precisely resembles Pseudonautilus from the Upper Jurassic .  - Cuttlefish are marine animals of the order Sepiida. They belong to the class Cephalopoda, which also includes squid, octopuses, and nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone. Despite their name, cuttlefish are not fish but molluscs.  - The siphuncle is a strand of tissue passing longitudinally through the shell of a cephalopod mollusk. Only cephalopods with chambered shells have siphuncles, such as the extinct ammonites and belemnites, and the living nautiluses, cuttlefish, and \\"Spirula\\". In the case of the cuttlefish, the siphuncle is indistinct and connects all the small chambers of that animal's highly modified shell; in the other cephalopods it is thread-like and passes through small openings in the walls dividing the chambers.  - A cephalopod (pronounced or ) is any member of the molluscan class Cephalopoda (Greek plural , \\"kephalópoda\\"; \\"head-feet\\"). These exclusively marine animals are characterized by bilateral body symmetry, a prominent head, and a set of arms or tentacles (muscular hydrostats) modified from the primitive molluscan foot. Fishermen sometimes call them inkfish, referring to their common ability to squirt ink. The study of cephalopods is a branch of malacology known as teuthology.

As they grow closer during their hostile confrontations, they are forced to confront their feelings for each other amidst a world full of deceit, rivalries, and danger. The movie begins with Farrell (played by a popular Hollywood actor), a skilled undercover agent, receiving his new assignment to infiltrate the criminal empire of Gilda (played by a renowned actress), a feared and mysterious figure in the city. Gilda runs her business with an iron fist and is known to be ruthless towards anyone who dares to defy or deceive her. The authorities believe that she has a significant role in human trafficking, arms dealing, and various other criminal activities. Farrell's mission is to collect concrete evidence and bring down her empire. Farrell's journey starts by working his way up in the underground criminal world, gaining trust, and gaining access to Gilda's inner circle. As he gets closer to her, he begins to discover that Gilda is not the cold, heartless criminal everyone thinks she is. There's another side to her - one that is scarred by a dark past and a series of personal losses. Farrell finds it hard to maintain a facade as he too begins to empathize with Gilda's position.

Here is a news article: Alaska State Troopers say a Swiss woman who was trying to wade across a swollen Alaska river to see an abandoned bus made famous in the movie \\"Into the Wild\\" has drowned.      Troopers say 29-year-old Claire Jane Ackermann attempted to cross the Teklanika River with a 27-year-old man from France on Saturday when they lost their footing and were pulled under by the current, according to the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner. The man survived.      The old Fairbanks city bus was where 24-year-old Chris McCandless camped out and starved to death in 1992. It has become a destination for adventurers.      The 2007 movie was an adaptation of the Jon Krakauer book about McCandless, who began wandering across the country after college. ||||| Swiss woman drowns in Teklanika River, near 'Into the Wild' bus      FAIRBANKS — The fact that a 29-year-old Swiss woman drowned Saturday while attempting to cross the Teklanika River on the Stampede Trail doesn’t surprise Jon Nierenberg.What surprises him is that it didn’t happen to someone a lot sooner.Nierenberg, who owns a lodge four miles from the end of Stampede Road, said it was just a matter of time before someone drowned trying to cross the river to reach the old Fairbanks city bus made famous in the movie “Into the Wild.”Since the critically acclaimed film was released three years ago, the bus where 24-year-old Chris McCandless starved to death in 1992 has become a destination for adventurers following in McCandless’ footsteps.“Honestly, I’m amazed this hasn’t happened earlier,” Nierenberg said Monday by phone.Whether or not backpacker Claire Jane Ackermann was on her way to the bus is not known, but Nierenberg said practically everyone who hikes the Stampede Trail has the same destination in mind.“It’s not a casual place to go hiking,” Nierenberg said. “I have absolutely no doubt what she was doing out there.”Ackermann was trying to wade east to west across the swollen stream with a 27-year-old man from France about 1 p.m. Saturday. The pair were headed in the direction of the bus. The two hikers had tied themselves onto a rope that had been placed across the stream earlier this summer. They lost their footing and were pulled under by the current.The man told Alaska State Troopers and rangers from Denali National Park and Preserve that he was able to cut himself free from the main line and make his way to the bank, where he dropped his backpack. When he turned back, the man said, Ackermann was under water.The hiker made his way back and cut her loose from the main line. He floated downstream with her for half a mile. When the man pulled her to shore, Ackermann was unresponsive. The man tried to resuscitate her but was unsuccessful.The French hiker ran into another hiking party, which reported the incident to troopers and the National Park Service. Ackermann’s body and the French hiker were flown out by a park helicopter Saturday evening.Troopers spokeswoman Megan Peters said a trooper asked the French man whether they were hiking to the old green-and-white bus. “He said ‘no,’” Peters said. “He said they were just hiking in the area.”“It’s anybody’s guess what they were doing out there,” she said.The bus, located about 18 miles from the end of Stampede Road off the Parks Highway in Healy, has become a destination for people from around the world since Jon Krakauer wrote his best-selling book “Into the Wild” in 1996. After the book was adapted into a critically acclaimed film starring Emile Hirsch and directed by Sean Penn three years ago, the number of hikers trying to reach the bus increased significantly.Troopers and park service rangers have conducted several search and rescues involving hikers who have become lost or stranded while hiking to the bus in the last few years.A month ago, troopers rescued four teenagers who became stranded on their way to the abandoned bus. The teens, ages 16 and 17, got separated after their vehicle became stuck on Stampede Trail. The teens were found by a Fairbanks trooper in a Super Cub and a Cantwell trooper on an ATV.“Everybody has noticed an increase (in the number of hikers going to the bus) in the last three years,” said Richard Moore, north district ranger for Denali National Park and Preserve. There is “general concern” because many of the people hiking to the bus are inexperienced in the Alaska backcountry, he said.“We try to give information to people and tell them that they should be prepared and educated about how to travel in the backcountry,” Moore said.The Stampede Trail river crossing is along the park’s northern boundary and park rangers are still trying to determine if Ackermann drowned inside or outside of the park. She was about a half-mile inside the park boundary when she was brought to shore by her companion.The Teklanika River, about 10 miles from the end of Stampede Road, poses the biggest challenge — and threat — for hikers on the Stampede Trail. The swift, glacier-fed stream is difficult to cross even at low water.On Saturday, the river was raging because of glacial melting in the warm temperatures, park spokesperson Kris Fister said.A week and a half ago, two hikers called Nierenberg on their satellite phone when they couldn’t get back across the river after hiking to the bus.Nierenberg told them they could wade upstream to look for a better place to cross or wait until early morning to cross when the water was at its lowest point. He also gave them the phone number for Era Aviation to call for a helicopter if they wanted to spend the 1,000 or so that would cost.As it turned out, the two hikers met three others, and the group was able to cross.For whatever reason, Nierenberg said, he has seen an increase in the amount of bus traffic this summer. Some of the hikers stop at his lodge to talk about the trail and river crossing, but most of them don’t, he said. The ones that stop usually don’t have a clue what they’re doing, Nierenberg said.“Most of these guys don’t have any conception of river crossings,” he said. “Most of their knowledge is from YouTube.”The rope across the river, which is still in place, appears to be about 3/8-inch braided, nylon rope and is tied on both ends to small trees and brush, said Moore, who has seen pictures. A rope across the river is not uncommon, the ranger said.“Every time I’ve gone out there, someone has put up a rope somewhere across the river,” he said. “It either gets broken or taken down or disappears in the winter.”Using a rope as a crossing aid is risky, Moore said.“If properly used, it could help, but unfortunately a lot of people don’t use it properly, and it leads to incidents like we had Saturday,” he said.Most people bring rope to help get them across the river, Nierenberg said. A former park ranger in Denali, Nierenberg said he was trained to cross rivers using walking sticks or a pole pointed upstream held by multiple people.“Some of these guys are talking about crossing with rope tied around their waist, which is like suicide,” he said.A rope, he said, “is like tying yourself into a raft in whitewater — it can help you live or it can help you die.”Nierenberg speculated that a group of five motorcyclists from the Lower 48, who hiked to the bus about three weeks ago, installed the rope. One of the motorcyclists was nearly swept downriver after getting knocked off his feet on the way back, he said.“He was holding onto the rope and ended up having to let go,” said Nierenberg, who talked to the men before they left and when they returned. “His friends ran downstream and fished him out.“When he came back here his eyes were pretty wide,” Nierenberg said. “He knew that he had almost died.”Rangers are still trying to determine whether the rope is inside or outside the park boundary, Moore said.“Our best guess is one side may be in the park and the other side may not be in the park,” he said.If the rope is inside the park, Moore said, rangers will remove it. If the rope is on state land, he said, rangers will notify troopers.What action troopers might take is unclear, Peters said.“I think we will have to await word from the rangers before that would be assessed,” she wrote in an e-mail. “I don’t know if that would be an appropriate use of our resources, as it would have to be decided if it was an immediate threat to public safety.”Contact staff writer Tim Mowry at 459-7587. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"The news article discusses the drowning of a 29-year-old Swiss woman, Claire Jane Ackermann, in the Teklanika River in Alaska while attempting to cross it to reach the well-known abandoned bus from the movie \\"Into the Wild.\\" The bus has become a popular destination for adventurers since Chris McCandless starved to death there in 1992, which later inspired Jon Krakauer's best-selling book and a critically acclaimed film.

Given those answer options, answer the question: Jason had been sitting alone at his table, staring at the tall, platinum blonde for an hour. His imagination ran wild with thoughts of kissing her full lips while his hands explored her lean, muscled body. Tonight he didn't need the whiskey to warm him up. But he kept drinking it anyway. She stepped away from the mike, sat her acoustic guitar on its stand, and walked down from the small stage. Jason beat all the other losers to the bar and sat down beside her. \\"You must be pretty thirsty after all that beautiful singing.\\" How many times had she heard that line? But at age 33, she'd probably heard every pickup line known to man. \\"Yeah,\\" she said, giving him a quick glance. He wasn't a bad looking guy. Probably a couple of inches shorter than her. At six-foot-two, she was accustomed to that. But a lot of men couldn't deal with her height. They liked to be the tall one in the relationship. Not that she'd had many relationships. Mostly one-nighters.

Question: What is Gianni's job? Movie title: C'eravamo tanto amati Movie plot: In the first part (shot in black-and-white) the friends Gianni (Gassman), Antonio (Manfredi) and Nicola (Satta Flores) are partisans who fight for the liberation of Italy from the yoke of Nazi occupation and the fascist collaborationists aiding in it. After the end of World War II, the three go for different lives: Nicola in Nocera Inferiore (southern Italy), Antonio in Rome and Gianni in Pavia. Later, both Antonio and Gianni fall in love with young Luciana (Sandrelli), and through their relationships go back to the history of post-war Italy, along with the related hopes and disappointments. Gianni, now a lawyer's assistant, moves to Rome and arranges to marry the semi-illiterate daughter of a construction tycoon with questionable fame, a former fascist who managed to get good connections with the pro-American conservative Christian democratic party dominating public life (and building licenses) in post-war Italy. His wife, resenting her inadequacy, tries to turn into the woman he longs for but ultimately fails and dies in a car accident. Antonio, worker in a hospital, has instead remained loyal to the ideals of their youth, and is now a fervent communist activist. Nicola, the most intellectual of the trio, leaves Nocera and his family and moves to Rome, too, to try win a fortune on the famous TV quiz Lascia o raddoppia. After his failure, he leads an economically troubled life writing occasional articles for newspapers, increasingly turning himself into a caricature of an intellectual, lost in futile polemics. After several decades the three friends meet again in the trattoria where they spent their last evening together, commenting bitterly on their lives. Antonio, the orderly has less to complain about and tells his other friends that Luciana has become his wife and he now has two children with her. Later in the evening Nicola argues with him on ideological questions, eventually physically attacking him. In the fray, Gianni loses his driving license and the following day Antonio, Nicola and Luciana try to...

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Date Sunday 22 May 2016 Add punctuation","output":"Date: Sunday, 22 May 2016 Add punctuation: On Sunday, May 22, 2016, we were given the task to add punctuation to a sentence or a piece of text. Punctuation is a crucial part of written communication, as it helps convey the intended meaning, tone, and structure. Without the proper use of punctuation, text can become difficult to understand, and the intended messages may be lost or misconstrued. Punctuation marks that are commonly used include the comma (,), period (.), question mark (?), exclamation point (!), colon (:), semicolon (;), quotation marks (\\" \\"), apostrophe ('), brackets ([]), braces ({}), parentheses (()), ellipsis (...), hyphen (-), en dash (–), em dash (—), and slash (/). Each of these punctuation marks has a specific purpose and rules for proper usage. Here is a breakdown of how to use some of the most common punctuation marks: 1. Commas (,): Commas are used to separate items in a list, clauses in a compound sentence, and to indicate a pause in speech. They can also be used to separate an introductory phrase or word from the main part of the sentence. Example: I bought apples, bananas, and oranges at the store. 2. Periods (.): Periods are used at the end of a complete sentence to indicate a full stop. Example: She went to the gym after work. 3. Question marks (?): Question marks are used at the end of a sentence to indicate that it is a question. Example: Are you going to the concert tonight? 4. Exclamation points (!): Exclamation points are used to express strong emotions or to indicate that a sentence should be read with emphasis. Example: Watch out for the car! 5. Colons (:): Colons are used to introduce a list or to separate two independent clauses when the second clause explains or illustrates the first. Example: She has three favorite colors: red, blue, and green. 6. Semicolons (;): Semicolons are used to connect two independent clauses that are related in meaning but could also stand alone. Example: I have a big presentation today; I stayed up all night preparing for it. 7. Quotation marks (\\" \\"): Quotation marks are used to indicate direct speech, a quote, or the title of a short work (such as a poem or an article). Example: She asked, \\"Do you need any help?\\" 8. Apostrophes ('): Apostrophes are used to indicate possession or to create contractions. Example: Sara's book is on the table. (possession) Example: She's going to the movies. (contraction) 9. Parentheses (()): Parentheses are used to set off additional information or an explanation within a sentence. Example: She has two cats (Simba and Nala) who love to play together. 10. Hyphens (-): Hyphens are used to connect compound words or to separate syllables of a single word when it is broken across two lines of text. Example: My twenty-five-year-old cousin will be starting college in the fall. In conclusion, the proper use of punctuation is essential for clear and effective written communication. Learning how and when to use each punctuation mark will greatly improve your writing and make it easier for others to understand your intended meaning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Summarize: The logo on the side of the locomotive of the 0905 Budapest to Munich Intercity train could not have been more ironic: \\"Pan-European Picnic - 25 years of Open Borders.\\" The Pan-European Picnic was the remarkable event on the Hungarian-Austrian border in August 1989, when the border guards of Communist Hungary defied orders and stood aside and allowed hundreds of East German refugees to run across the border into Austria. The green carriages of the train to Munich on Thursday morning soon filled with Syrians, Afghans, Iraqis and a host of other nationalities. They were trapped in Hungary by the decision of the Hungarian government to block their route to Germany. But the train did not go to Munich. The gates of the station had opened at 08:20, closely followed by a stampede of refugees. At 08:52 the government spokesman, Zoltan Kovacs, informed me that the refugees would be taken to refugee camps instead. At 11:00 the train left, and at 12:00 it arrived in Bicske, the site of a refugee camp, 37km (23 miles) west of Budapest. The refugees refused to leave, and a 28-hour standoff with police developed. I spoke to local people, who wandered down to the tracks to see world news unfolding on their doorstep. Many Hungarians, especially those fed a diet of anti-migrant vitriol on state radio and television, are suspicious of the thousands of people from other cultures now traipsing through their country. So I was surprised when one woman said quietly to me: \\"You should remember that many of us, Hungarians, were refugees too\\". She belonged to the Hungarian minority in Romania, and fled to the country in the 1980s, to escape the terrifying regime of Nicolae Ceausescu, she said. Hungarian government officials insist that there is no parallel between 1989 and 2015. Or between the Iron Curtain which once split Europe, and the razor wire fence they are still reinforcing along their southern border with Serbia. Or between the 1956 revolution, when a quarter of a million Hungarians escaped across the same border into Austria, to escape Soviet tanks, and current events. But the fact is that many Hungarians, Slovaks, Czechs, Poles, Serbs and Romanians, not to mention Germans and Austrians, have personal memories of having to run for their lives. Some remember those stories from their parents and grandparents. And when they see the refugees in Hungary today, they are torn between an official rhetoric which often demonises \\"illegal migrants\\", and their own experience of expulsion and charity. One big difference between 1956, 1989, and 2015 is cultural. Many of the new arrivals are Muslims. Some are Africans. These are not Europeans fleeing within Europe. Walk the streets of Budapest, Prague or Bratislava, and the faces are more homogenous. Only the Chinese and Vietnamese are here already in large numbers. This is largely the result of the mass murders and forced population movements of the Second World War and its immediate aftermath. Another problem is a genuine resentment in eastern Europe at being talked down to by west European leaders. For the Hungarians, the sheer numbers now are also an important factor. By Saturday night, 175,000 asylum seekers had been registered by the Hungarian authorities this year - 50,000 in August alone. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has warned that millions, not hundreds of thousands of migrants will flood Europe. Nobody knows if that is true, not even Mr Orban, but only one year ago two million Hungarians trusted his word enough to vote him into office for four more years. There is also now a sort of rearguard action by the governments of Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic to defend what they regard as \\"Christian Europe\\" from those it regards as \\"aliens\\". Robert Fico's Slovak government only reluctantly agreed to accept 200 asylum seekers from Syria, awaiting processing in neighbouring Austria, on condition that they are Christian. Yet another factor in the migration equation is the large ethnic Roma population in eastern Europe. Hungarian Justice Minister Laszlo Trocsanyi caused a stir recently by suggesting that Hungary could hardly help so many refugees, when it already has 800,000 Roma to integrate. Some criminal gangs from the Roma clans of eastern Hungary stand accused of muscling in on the lucrative business of trafficking migrants from the Serbian border to Austria. But most Roma are watching the current crisis from the sidelines. In Budapest, a man begging outside the East Station claimed to be Syrian. \\"Don't believe him\\", shouted a woman from the doorway of a shop - \\"he's a local\\".  For local, read Roma. East station has now been re-Christened \\"the Middle East station\\", in popular parlance, because of the sheer number of Syrians and Iraqis around it. And the \\"pan-global picnic\\" continues, on every platform. Summary:","output":"The logo on the Budapest to Munich Intercity train reads \\"Pan-European Picnic - 25 years of Open Borders\\" in reference to the historic event in 1989 when the Hungarian-Austrian border was opened, allowing East German refugees to cross into Austria. However, the recent journey saw the train filled with Syrian, Afghan, and Iraqi refugees, stopped by the Hungarian government and the passengers taken to refugee camps. Hungary has seen 175,000 asylum seekers registered within its borders just this year, with 50,000 arriving in August alone. The Hungarian government, along with Slovakia and the Czech Republic, are attempting to defend what they see as \\"Christian Europe\\" from the influx of refugees, leading to a clash between citizens' memories of their own past experiences as refugees and the often demonizing rhetoric surrounding \\"illegal migrants.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Since the man loses 60% by selling 20 pencils for a rupee, we will calculate the cost price as follows: Let the cost price of 1 pencil be x. Selling price of 20 pencils = 1 rupee Since there is a 60% loss, we know that the selling price (1 rupee) is 40% of the cost price (1 - loss percentage). Now, let's calculate the cost price of 20 pencils: 1 (selling price) = 40% of cost price 1 = 0.4 * (20 * x) => x = 1 / 8 Now we know the cost price of 1 pencil is 1/8 rupees. Next, let's find out how many pencils the man should sell for a rupee in order to gain 60%.  Let the number of pencils be N.

Please briefly summarize this news article: The Photo That Changed America's Civil Rights Movement The raw videos depict the last moments of Philando Castile‘s and Alton Sterling‘s lives. Widely shared on social media – one of them live – they have shocked an entire nation. Like the videos that showed the killings of Walter L. Scott, Tamir Rice and Eric Garner in 2014 and 2015, they provide the necessary imagery to force us to address, once again, the pervasive and inherent racial inequalities that still exist across the country. More than 60 years ago, when racial segregation was still the norm in many states, one grieving mother, Mamie Elizabeth Till-Mobley, understood the power of imagery to expose America’s racism. In August 1955, Emmett Till, a black teenager from Chicago, was visiting relatives in Mississippi when he stopped at Bryant’s Grocery and Meat Market. There he encountered Carolyn Bryant, a white woman. Whether Till really flirted with Bryant or whistled at her isn’t known. But what happened four days later is. Bryant’s husband Roy and his half brother, J.W. Milam, seized the 14-year-old from his great-uncle’s house. The pair then beat Till, shot him, and strung barbed wire and a 75-pound metal fan around his neck and dumped the lifeless body in the Tallahatchie River. A white jury quickly acquitted the men, with one juror saying it had taken so long only because they had to break to drink some pop. When Till’s mother Mamie came to identify her son, she told the funeral director, “Let the people see what I’ve seen.” She brought him home to Chicago and insisted on an open casket. Tens of thousands filed past Till’s remains, but it was the publication of the searing image photographed by David Jackson and first published in Jet magazine, with a stoic Mamie gazing at her murdered child’s ravaged body, that forced the world to reckon with the brutality of American racism. For almost a century, African Americans were lynched with regularity and impunity. Now, thanks to a mother’s determination to expose the barbarousness of the crime, the public could no longer pretend to ignore what they couldn’t see. In this video narrated by Bryan Stevenson, an attorney and the executive director of the Equal Justice Initiative, has no doubt: “Without the images,” he says “no one would be prepared to believe the violence we’ve witnessed.” In revisiting Jackson’s photograph today, he believes, “that image still has resonance, it still has power. I think it still expresses the pain and anguish of a huge part of our population that is still hoping for basic recognition of their humanity.” Summary:","output":"The brutal murder of Emmett Till, a black teenager, in 1955 and the publication of his mutilated body's image in Jet magazine, marked a turning point in the American civil rights movement. The image, captured by David Jackson, exposed the extent of racial violence and forced the world to reckon with the brutality of American racism. Today, videos capturing the killings of people like Philando Castile and Alton Sterling serve a similar purpose, highlighting racial inequalities across the United States."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It seemed as though little effort was put into the preparation and presentation of the dishes, which was disheartening considering the reputation of the restaurant. The service I received was slow and unresponsive. Our server took a long time to take our order, as well as to bring our food and drinks. When we needed something, it was difficult to get their attention, and when we finally did, they often forgot our requests. It made me feel like our dining experience was not a priority to the staff, which was frustrating. The atmosphere of the restaurant was also not what I expected. The lighting was too bright and harsh, making it difficult to relax and enjoy the meal. The noise level was also quite high, as the tables were closely packed together and conversations from other diners made it hard to carry on a conversation with my own party.

Winning several critical battles, this leads to a significant decline in the cartel's influence in key areas such as Cordoba, Veracruz, Puebla, and Oaxaca. As a result, peace and stability gradually return to these regions, while the people of Mexico begin to rebuild their lives and communities in a safer environment. Throughout this process, the Mexican government works closely with the United States and other international partners to improve border security and prevent the expansion of the Zetas and other drug cartels into new territories. These cooperative efforts prove successful, contributing to a safer and more secure future for both Mexico and its neighbors. Step-by-step justification: 1. Given that Raul Lucio Hernandez Lechuga, a key figure in the Zetas, is captured, it's logical to assume that the authorities would intensify their efforts to dismantle the cartel. 2. As these efforts are successful in critical battles, the cartel's influence in the mentioned regions would diminish. 3. Peace and stability returning to the affected regions is a positive outcome for the people living there. 4.

Jennifer asked Felicia to help them make a diet plan and exercise routine.  Possible answers: [i] Jennifer wanted to lose weight.. [ii] Felicia wanted to lose weight..","output":"To determine the correct ending of the sentence, let's analyze the sentence information and use context clues. The sentence states that \\"Jennifer asked Felicia to help them make a diet plan and exercise routine.\\" Now, let's analyze the possible answers: [i] Jennifer wanted to lose weight. [ii] Felicia wanted to lose weight. In option [i], it suggests that Jennifer is the one seeking assistance to create a diet plan and exercise routine, which makes sense since the sentence indicates Jennifer is the one asking for help. Therefore, it's logical to assume that Jennifer is the one wanting to lose weight. In option [ii], although it mentions Felicia, it would be less likely for Felicia to be the one wanting to lose weight since she is not the one requesting the diet plan and exercise routine. Based on the analysis, the most logical ending to the sentence would be: Jennifer asked Felicia to help them make a diet plan and exercise routine because Jennifer wanted to lose weight."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

But water also can be dangerous for kids if you don't take great care. Nearly 1,000 kids die each year by drowning. Here are some tips to keep your kids safe in the water: At the Lake or Pond *Don't let little kids swim alone without adult supervision-- lakes or ponds may be shallow near the bank and are suddenly deep sharply further out from shore. *Ponds and lakes may hide jagged rocks, broken glass, or rubbish. *Make sure kids wear foot protection; even in the water, they should wear socks or water shoes. *Watch out for weeds and grass in the water that could trap a leg or arm. *Most boating accidents, particularly among teenagers, are related to alcohol . Be sure teens know about the dangers of alcohol, on and off the water. At the Beach *Teach kids to always swim when and where a lifeguard is on duty. Unlike the calm waters of a swimming pool, the beach has special dangers like currents and tides . Check with the lifeguard when you arrive to find out about the water conditions. *Tell kids never to stand with their back to the water because a sudden wave can easily knock a child over. *Teach kids that if they're caught in a dangerous wave, they should swim parallel  to the shore or should tread  water and call for a lifeguard's help. Whether at the lake or at the beach, teach your child to get out of the water during bad weather, especially lightning. Question: Which is the right behavior when swimming at the beach? - Go off the water without a lifeguard on duty - Go on swimming in a heavy rain - Go off the water before checking the water conditions - Call for help if caught in a dangerous wave Answer:","output":"Call for help if caught in a dangerous wave"},{"instruction":"This is a correct answer to the following question about Space exploration.

Does it follow that \\"I think she looked very sickly and tired.\\"?","output":"Yes, the statement \\"I think she looked very sickly and tired\\" can be extrapolated from \\"She looked very tired and ill, I thought.\\" Both sentences convey the same overarching idea: the observer's perception that the woman appeared to be tired and not in good health. In both instances, the speaker professes their personal view on the woman's condition, emphasizing their impression that she is unwell. However, the expressions and words used in each sentence differ slightly, which results in two unique interpretations of the same opinion. In the original sentence, \\"She looked very tired and ill, I thought\\", the phrase \\"I thought\\" indicates that the speaker is reflecting on a past observation of the woman. The choice of words \\"tired\\" and \\"ill\\" suggest that the woman's appearance seemed to indicate exhaustion and poor health. Putting \\"I thought\\" at the end of the sentence emphasizes the idea that this is the speaker's perspective on the situation. On the other hand, the rephrased statement, \\"I think she looked very sickly and tired,\\" places the emphasis on the speaker's thoughts by positioning \\"I think\\" at the beginning of the sentence. The use of the word \\"sickly\\" rather than \\"ill\\" creates a stronger impression of the woman's apparent unwell state.

Information:  - The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system comprising the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of those objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest eight are the planets, with the remainder being significantly smaller objects, such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly, the moons, two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury.  - Arsia Mons is the southernmost of three volcanos (collectively known as Tharsis Montes) on the Tharsis bulge near the equator of the planet Mars. To its north is Pavonis Mons, and north of that is Ascraeus Mons. The tallest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, is to its northwest. Its name comes from a corresponding albedo feature on a map by Giovanni Schiaparelli, which he named in turn after the legendary Roman forest of Arsia Silva.  - The Tharsis quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The Tharsis quadrangle is also referred to as MC-9 (Mars Chart-9).  - Lava is the molten rock expelled by a volcano during an eruption. The resulting rock after solidification and cooling is also called \\"lava\\". The molten rock is formed in the interior of some planets, including Earth, and some of their satellites. The source of the heat that melts the rock within the earth is geothermal energy. When first erupted from a volcanic vent, lava is a liquid usually at temperatures from .   - A space probe is a robotic spacecraft that leaves Earth orbit and explores space. It may approach the Moon; enter interplanetary space; flyby, orbit, or land on other planetary bodies; or approach interstellar space.  - Pavonis Mons (Latin for \\"peacock mountain\\") is a large shield volcano located in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars. It is the middle member of a chain of three volcanic mountains (collectively known as the Tharsis Montes) that straddle the Martian equator between longitudes 235°E and 259°E. The volcano was discovered by the Mariner 9 spacecraft in 1971 and was originally called Middle Spot. Its name formally became Pavonis Mons in 1973.  - A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, that allows hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface.  - Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, after Mercury. Named after the Roman god of war, it is often referred to as the \\"Red Planet\\" because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth.  - Magma (from Ancient Greek  (\\"mágma\\") meaning \\"thick unguent\\") is a mixture of molten or semi-molten rock, volatiles and solids that is found beneath the surface of the Earth, and is expected to exist on other terrestrial planets and some natural satellites. Besides molten rock, magma may also contain suspended crystals, dissolved gas and sometimes gas bubbles. Magma often collects in magma chambers that may feed a volcano or solidify underground to form an intrusion. Magma is capable of intruding into adjacent rocks (forming igneous dikes and sills), extrusion onto the surface as lava, and explosive ejection as tephra to form pyroclastic rock.  - Tharsis is a vast volcanic plateau centered near the equator in the western hemisphere of Mars. The region is home to the largest volcanoes in the Solar System, including the three enormous shield volcanoes Arsia Mons, Pavonis Mons, and Ascraeus Mons, which are collectively known as the Tharsis Montes. The tallest volcano on the planet, Olympus Mons, is often associated with the Tharsis region but is actually located off the western edge of the plateau. The name Tharsis is the Greco-Latin transliteration of the biblical Tarshish, the land at the western extremity of the known world.  - The Tharsis Montes are three large shield volcanoes in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars. From north to south, the volcanoes are Ascraeus Mons, Pavonis Mons and Arsia Mons. Mons (plural \\"montes\\") is the Latin word for mountain. It is a descriptor term used in astrogeology for mountainous features in the Solar System.  - Ulysses Tholus is a Martian volcano. It is located in the Tharsis quadrangle at 2.89° north latitude and 121.55° west longitude. It is 58 km across and is named after a classical albedo feature name. Ulysses Tholus is immediately east and slightly north of another volcano, Biblis Tholus.   - Olympus Mons (Latin for Mount Olympus) is a very large shield volcano on the planet Mars. By one measure, it has a height of nearly 22 km (13.6 mi). Olympus Mons stands about two and a half times as tall as Mount Everest's height above sea level. It is the youngest of the large volcanoes on Mars, having formed during Mars's Hesperian Period. It is currently the largest volcano discovered in the Solar System and had been known to astronomers since the late 19th century as the albedo feature Nix Olympica (Latin for \\"Olympic Snow\\"). Its mountainous nature was suspected well before space probes confirmed its identity as a mountain.  - Ascraeus Mons is a large shield volcano located in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars. It is the northernmost and tallest of three shield volcanoes collectively known as the Tharsis Montes. The volcano's location corresponds to the classical albedo feature Ascraeus Lacus.  - Biblis Tholus is an extinct Martian volcano located at 2.55 ° N 235.62 ° E , one of two volcanoes near the center of the Tharsis volcanism . Along with Ulysses Tholus , it is almost midway between Olympus Mons and the Tharsis Montes . It is approximately 170 kilometers ( 110 mi ) long and 100 kilometers ( 62 mi ) wide , rising about 3 kilometers ( 1.9 mi ) from its surroundings . In the middle of the volcano is a caldera , named Biblis Patera , believed to have formed as the result of collapse of the magma chamber during eruptions of the volcano . The caldera is 53 kilometers ( 33 mi ) in diameter and four kilometers ( 2.5 miles ) in depth .  - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets.  - Mount Everest, also known in Nepal as Sagarmth and in China as Chomolungma/, is earth's highest mountain. Its peak is above sea level. Mount Everest is in the Mahalangur Range. The international border between China (Tibet Autonomous Region) and Nepal runs across Everest's summit point. Its massif includes neighbouring peaks Lhotse, ; Nuptse, , and Changtse, .  - A mountain is a large landform that stretches above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak. A mountain is generally steeper than a hill. Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism. These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth. Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers, weather conditions, and glaciers. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in huge mountain ranges.  - A magma chamber is a large underground pool of liquid rock found beneath the surface of the Earth. The molten rock in such a chamber is under great pressure, and given enough time, that pressure can gradually fracture the rock around it creating outlets for the magma. If it finds a way to the surface, then the result will be a volcanic eruption; consequently many volcanoes are situated over magma chambers.  Magma chambers are hard to detect, and most of the known ones are therefore close to the surface of the Earth, commonly between 1 km and 10 km under the surface. In geological terms, this is extremely close to the surface, although in human terms, it is considerably deep underground.

Then one Friday morning I took part in a three-day self-help program for teenagers. Whether you believe it or not, that weekend changed my life. About 100 other teenagers were there. During the first two days I met a lot of great people. I was glad because I made so many friends there. On Sunday, the leader did an interesting exercise called \\"Chocolate or Toys\\". He asked a girl which she liked better, chocolate or toys. She chose chocolate. Then he asked her to choose again between chocolate and chocolate. Of course, she didn't have a choice. This exercise told us that sometimes we don't have a choice in life, and that sometimes we have to accept something, rather than complaining . A girl stood up and started talking about her mom who was a drug addict  and how much she hated her mother. \\"I want a new mom,\\" she cried. \\"Unluckily, you can't have one,\\" the leader replied. \\"You have to accept the mother that you have.\\" This hit me hard.

Accused: A file photo shows civil rights power attorney Sanford Rubenstein, who's been accused of raping another trusted ally of Al Sharpton after the reverend's 60th birthday bash on Saturday. Sharpton, therefore we have no comment at this time.' Sharpton's decision to distance himself from Rubenstein underlines the severity of the allegations against the attorney. The National Action Network, a civil rights organization founded by Sharpton, is likely facing a difficult time in light of these accusations, as Rubenstein played a crucial role in many of the group's high-profile legal cases. It seems that the organization is striving to protect its own reputation as well as Sharpton's by refraining from commenting on the ongoing investigation. The collection of potential evidence from Rubenstein's Upper East Side apartment suggests that the police are taking these allegations very seriously. The presence of bloody condoms and a sex toy might provide crucial information regarding the events that transpired after Sharpton's birthday celebration, ultimately helping to determine whether the accusations against Rubenstein hold any merit. In situations like these, it is essential for all parties involved, including Sharpton, the National Action Network, and the accuser, to act with discretion as the investigation unfolds.

Blind rivets can be installed from 1 side and create secure fastenings without the hammering process necessary for solid rivet installation. Standard blind rivets are the most affordable type and are great for holes that are regularly shaped and aligned properly.  Use standard blind rivets for securing metal pieces that aren't going to carry lots of weight. To determine the maximum weight your rivets can hold, look at the back of the package for their shear strength. Never use standard rivets for situations that require a water-proof seal. If you're working with important structural joints, don't use blind rivets. Instead, use solid rivets with a pneumatic rivet gun. These rivets have a wider grip range and always completely fill the holes in your metal due to their \\"bulbing\\" action. They are best suited for irregular, oversized, or misaligned holes, as well as situations where you're unsure of the optimal rivet length.  Multi-grip rivet seals are weather and vibration-proof. Sealed rivets possess an enclosed mandrel (the longer end) that creates a water-tight seal upon installation. They can fasten many kinds of materials and perform well across varying temperature fluctuations and thicknesses.  If you don't need a water-tight seal, opt for standard rivets instead—they're typically cheaper than sealed products. Interlock rivets are best if you need increased pull-out and shear strength, such as in structural applications. They come in large sizes that typically don't fit the smaller rivet guns.  Interlock rivets work great for closing big gaps and preventing sheet movement. Dome head rivets are the most common type for pop guns due to their versatility and simple application. They're best used for situations that require reliability and safety. For example, thousands of dome head rivets are used to create the structural frame of modern aircraft.  If you're unsure of the applicability of dome heads for your situation, take a look at their packaging to determine the shear strength (listed as weight in pounds) that they can support. Use dome heads when connecting material similar to carbon steel, when the rivet is close to the edge of the material you are fastening. These blind rivets are also called round heads. Flat rivets are countersunk and ideal for soft materials, which are defined as anything easily deformed by temperature extremes or fluctuations, such as polymers, granular materials, and soft biological materials. This is due to their large head that increases their load-bearing area. They are also ideal for situations where nearby rivets and structures make it impossible to accommodate round heads. Load-bearing area is the region that the load-bearing structure can reliably hold up. There are many different kinds of rivet materials. Always match the rivet to the type of metal you're attaching whenever possible. For example, aluminum metal should be fastened with aluminum rivets.  If you're fastening leather with a rivet, always use copper, aluminum, or brass. Steel rivets will rust due to leather's tendency to retain moisture. Steel mandrels have a tendency to corrode, and can also create a reaction with surrounding materials. Avoid purchasing rivets that are made from steel mandrels paired with a stainless steel or aluminum body.  Purchase a variety pack for a wide selection of rivets of different sizes and materials. Summary:","output":"This article discusses various types of blind rivets, their applications, and material considerations for secure fastenings in different situations, highlighting standard, multi-grip, sealed, interlock, dome head, and flat rivets, as well as appropriate use for different materials and load-bearing requirements."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Article: Your doctor will need to perform several tests to determine if you have diabetes. If you do, in fact, have diabetes or pre-diabetes, you will need to follow-up with regular treatment by following your doctor's instructions. The blood glucose test does exactly what it sounds like it does: it tests the amount of glucose (sugar) in your blood. This will be used to determine whether you have diabetes or are at risk of developing it. This test will done under one of three circumstances:  A fasting glucose blood test is done after you haven't had anything to eat for at least eight hours. If it is an emergency, your doctor will do a random blood glucose test regardless of whether you have eaten recently. A two-hour postprandial test is done two hours after eating a specific number of carbohydrates to test your body's ability to handle the sugar load. This test is usually done in a hospital so they can measure the number of carbs eaten before the test. An oral glucose tolerance test requires you to drink a high glucose fluid. They will test your blood and urine every 30-60 minutes to measure how well the body is able to tolerate the additional load. This test is not done if the doctor suspects type 1 diabetes. This blood test is also called the glycated hemoglobin test. It measures the amount of sugar attached to the body's hemoglobin molecules. This measurement gives the doctor a good indication of your average blood sugar measurements over the past 30 to 60 days. Ketone is found in the blood when an insulin shortage forces the body to break down fat for energy. It comes out through the urine, most often in patients with type 1 diabetes. Your doctor may recommend a blood or urine test for ketone:  If your blood sugar is higher than 240 mg/dL. During an illness such as pneumonia, stroke or heart attack. If you experience nausea and vomiting. During pregnancy. If you have diabetes or are at risk of developing it, it's important to monitor your health and blood sugar levels regularly. High blood sugar will cause damage to the microvascular (micro-blood vessels) in your organs. This damage can cause problems throughout the body. To monitor your overall health, get:  An annual eye exam Evaluation for diabetic neuropathy in the feet  Regular (at least annual) blood pressure monitoring Annual kidney testing Dental cleaning every 6 months Regular cholesterol testing Regular visits with your primary care doctor or endocrinologist What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article discusses the various tests and procedures that doctors use to diagnose and monitor diabetes.

David Plotz has been a writer with Slate since its inception in 1996.  Now, let's do some calculations to verify the hypothesis: David Plotz's age at the time of Slate's inception (1996) can be calculated by subtracting his birth year from the year Slate was founded:  1996 - 1970 = 26 years old Since David Plotz has been a writer with Slate since its inception in 1996, and he was 26 years old at that time, it's safe to conclude that he began writing for Slate before he was thirty.

Movie title: Sherrybaby Context: Sherry Swanson (Maggie Gyllenhall) arrives at the Genesis House, a way station for women who have recently been paroled from prison. A recovering heroin addict, she has just completed a three-year sentence for robbery to support her addiction. Although she has her own private room, she has chores she must perform and must share a pay phone with the other residents.Accustomed to using sex to get what she wants, she quickly seduces Andy (Rio Hackford), who manages the house. She also performs oral sex on her job placement counselor so he will get her the job she wants working in a daycare center. Sherry struggles with wanting to use again, and befriends Dean (Danny Trejo), a fellow recovery group member who remembers her from a bar she used to frequent when she was underage.She wants to be a good mother to her daughter, Alexis (Ryan Simpkins), who has been cared for by Sherry's brother, Bobby (Brad Henke), and sister-in-law, Lynette (Bridget Barkan). Alexis is confused about her mother's return, a situation that is not helped by Lynette's disapproval of Sherry and insistence that Alexis call her mother and Sherry by her first name.Sherry gets into conflict with another woman at Genesis and moves in with Bobby and Lynette. When her father (Sam Bottoms) and his wife come for a visit, Sherry tries to impress everyone by singing \\"Eternal Flame,\\" but the family is clearly more interested in Alexis and uncomfortable around Sherry. Alexis tells Sherry that Lynette doesn't want her to call Sherry mother, and Alexis and Lynette fight. Bobby takes Sherry to a motel. The next day, when Sherry reports to her parole officer, Hernandez (Giancarlo Esposito), he threatens to send her back to prison because she did not go through proper channels to leave Genesis.

After being released from prison and struggling with her heroin addiction, Sherry wishes to reconnect with her daughter and assume her role as a responsible and loving mother. Throughout the film, we see Sherry facing numerous challenges and obstacles in her path towards rebuilding her life and strengthening her relationship with Alexis. The tension between Sherry and her sister-in-law, Lynette, who has been taking care of Alexis during Sherry's incarceration, further complicates the situation. Lynette's disapproval of Sherry and her insistence that Alexis should not call Sherry \\"mother\\" show the level of estrangement Sherry experiences in her family. While Sherry's desire to repair her relationship with her daughter is the primary focus, we can also sense her attempts to reconnect with her brother, Bobby, and mend the strained ties with the rest of her family. Although her methods are sometimes misguided, such as seducing Andy or performing oral sex to secure a job, we can see Sherry's effort to regain stability and to make amends for her past mistakes. Another relationship that plays a role in Sherry's life is the one with Dean, whom she meets in her recovery group. This relationship is significant because it serves as an emotional support system for Sherry as she navigates the challenges of sobriety and rebuilding her life after prison. In conclusion, Sherry Swanson in the movie \\"Sherrybaby\\" primarily seeks to repair her relationship with her daughter, Alexis, in order to become a better mother and regain her place in her family. Along the way, she faces numerous obstacles, which highlight the struggles of addiction and recovery, and test her resolve to rebuild her life and reconnect with her loved ones."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After a 110-year wait, Hull City's European adventure very nearly lasted just seven days until Sone Aluko intervened to prolong their stay. But on the evidence of this lethargic and naïve performance, Steve Bruce's side will have to re-emerge with a newfound vigour and maturity when they face a final qualifier later this month. For now, though, relief is the overriding emotion on Humberside. VIDEO Scroll down for Steve Bruce is delighted for the supporters after a late win. Winner: Sone Aluko celebrates scoring the pivotal goal in the 2-1 win for Hull City against AS Trencin. Technique: The substitute adjusted well to fire home the winner at the KC Stadium. Delight: Hull City's European adventure can now continue. Crucial: Ahmed Elmohamady nods home an equaliser for Hull City against AS Trencin. Dream start: Tomas Malec gave the visitors a shock lead early on in the UEFA Europa League qualifier. HULL CITY:  McGregor 6; Bruce 6 (Ince 66, 6) Chester 6, Davies 6; Elmohamady 7, Livermore 6, Huddlestone 5 Snodgrass 5, Brady 6 (Rosenior 56, 6); Sagbo 7, Long 5 (Aluko 74, 7) Subs not used: Harper, McShane, Quinn. Booked: Long. Goals: Elmohamady 27, 80. AS TRENCIN: Volesak, Ramon, Klescik, Cogley, Hajrandinovic (Opatovsky 64), Misak (Mondek 82), Holubek, Lobotka, Simon (Rundic 90), Kubik, Malec. Subs not used: Semrinec, Skovajsa, Baris,. Booked: Holubek, Malek. Goal: Malek 2. They were 10 minutes away from suffering a humiliating first-round exit at the hands of the Slovakian minnows. Hull's players had already talked of winning the Europa League in Warsaw next May but they were staring at a nightmare until substitute Aluko pounced to volley home from six yards in the 80th minute. The goal keeps alive the dream of facing the likes of Inter Milan at the KC Stadium this season. To give their journey some perspective, exactly 10 years ago last night Hull were playing Bournemouth in League One. They won 1-0. Go back 15 years and they were getting beat 1-0 at Exeter City in England's bottom tier. Bruce handed a full debut to £6million signing Robert Snodgrass as he attempted to inject some energy following a sluggish showing during the goalless draw in Zilna last week. Trencin signalled their intention from the off when Haris Hajradinovic attempted to lob Allan McGregor from kick-off, the Scottish goalkeeper panicked enough to scramble before gathering. Battle: Shane Long fights for possession with Peter Cogley at the KC Stadium. But there was nothing he could do to prevent Trencin's shock opener just 90 seconds later as Frantisek Kubik escaped down the right and drew back for Tomas Malec to apply a measured finish. The visitors threatened to double their advantage when a well-worked free-kick landed at the feet of Jakub Holubek and he stung the palms of McGregor with a vicious strike from 20 yards. Hull should have been level when Shane Long broke free on 15 minutes but his dink was read by Milos Volesak and the stopper spread his frame to block. Long, though, was guilty of a glaring miss soon after when Snodgrass screwed a shot in to his unmarked feet on the edge of the six-yard box. First he stabbed tamely at Volesak before swiping at fresh air when the ball rebounded. It was an embarrassing passage which left the forward on the floor, face hidden in shame. Proving his worth: New signing Jake Livermore storms through midfield with the ball. But the KC crowd – and Long – exhaled a collective relief just moments later when Robbie Brady loaded a cross from the left and Ahmed Elmohamady rose to power a header into the bottom corner. Long was enduring a miserable night and he somehow headed straight at nemesis Volesak when a corner was deflected onto his brow just four yards from goal. Liam Rosenior was introduced after half-time and his first touch – a 25-yard drive – very nearly nestled in the top corner and Tom Huddlestone lashed narrowly over on 73 minutes. The home side continued to press and their prayers were answered when Aluko connected with Snodgrass' knock-down just yards from goal.

He walks humans for 7 a mile around the streets and park near his home, pioneering an alternative to dog walking that requires no leash, just an ability to walk, talk and, above all, listen.

But I think it’s therapeutic even if they’re not baring their souls Chuck McCarthy      Grumbling about traffic, for instance, felt better when delivered to an actual human ear rather than posted on social media. “Tweeting about it and getting no response just makes you feel sadder.”      So many requests have poured in that McCarthy has recruited five other walkers to serve different parts of LA, though he will not take any cut from their earnings until he figures out a professional business model.      Commenters on his Facebook page offer plenty of advice. “Charge more and scale it up. Figure out what the secret sauce is – personality, being a supremely good listener, paying attention to inane bullshit, etc – then train your walker bees accordingly.”      It could grow fast. A woman in Israel has copied the idea, someone in Britain wants him to do it there, and a guy in New York asked him to walk his eight-year-old son to the bus stop each day.      McCarthy, bemused and excited by the attention, is considering crowdfunding to hire techies to design an Uber-style app. In addition to ensuring proximity – he wants to stay local and on foot, not drive across town, let alone fly thousands of miles – the app would let walkers and clients rate each other for personability and walking speed. The latter is a key point for walkers since a slow pace, say two miles an hour, yields 14, versus 28 for a brisk four miles an hour.      Rory Carroll (@rorycarroll72) Just been walked by LA's first people walker, @ideasbychuck. 7 per mile. If an uber I'd give him 5 stars. pic.twitter.com/nKel8YbcH2      “Awesome concept, plenty of screwed up lonely people out there,” said one of his Facebook commenters, suggesting the job is more people whisperer than walker.      But according to McCarthy, paying to be walked does not mean people are friendless. It just means they cannot always coordinate leisure time with friends, a product of fluid schedules in the gig economy, leaving them isolated. “We’re on phones and computers constantly communicating but we’re not connecting as much. We need that human interaction.”      We’re on phones and computers constantly communicating but we’re not connecting as much Chuck McCarthy      We also need exercise. McCarthy has slimmed down two notches on his belt since starting the professional walking. “I try not to run because it could ruin my brand,” he deadpanned.      Originally from Atlanta, McCarthy is serious enough about acting that he declines to reveal his exact age, beyond saying he is in his 30s. He has found bit parts – most recently in a promo for the film Pete’s Dragon – since moving to LA a decade ago, but no breakthrough role.      “I grew the beard so I could play homeless people.” And, potentially, homicidal bikers. He is hopeful of landing that role.      McCarthy stresses that he is not a personal trainer. “I’m more about motivating someone to leave their house and walk than being a drill sergeant shouting at them.”      Might the daily treks up and down Los Feliz lead to a movie treatment? Thinner material, after all, has made it to the screen. The people walker grinned. “Why not? Maybe (Jean-Claude) Van Damme will play me.” ||||| A photo posted by Chuck McCarthy (@chuckhistory) on Jun 27, 2016 at 5:06pm PDT            In a society ripe with an obscene amount of excess capital sloshing around the top, only barely trickling down to the vast remainder of the population (billions of people), things are bound to get funky. The 'gig' or 'sharing' economy is a prime example; people with no choice but to work on a short-term, contractual basis without the benefits of a 401K, healthcare or the promise of a sustainable future.      While this usually ends up looking like a job with Uber or Postmates, a Hollywood man has decided to take advantage of our society's other defining trait—that is, chronic disconnection and loneliness—to make ends meet. Chuck McCarthy is the founder of \\"People Walker.\\" No, it's not a sex thing. Rather, for 7 a mile, McCarthy or one of his employees will keep you company while you go for a simple walk. As his flyer explains, McCarthy offers his services for those who need a kick of motivation to go walking, those who don't feel safe walking alone, and those who are afraid that other people might see them walking alone and think that they (the customer) has no friends.      See, McCarthy was was first thinking about becoming a dog walker. He's an aspiring actor playing the hard-knock industry game, just waiting for a his big break. But, as he explained frankly to KABC earlier this week, \\"I didn't want to pick up dog poop, and that's kind of what you're getting paid for, really, for dog walking.\\"      To be clear, the weekend staff here at LAist has nothing against McCarthy charging folks 7 a mile (is that closer to 14 or 21 hourly, before taxes?). We're, more so, just puzzled that McCarthy has had such a successful time with his startup venture. While safety in (walking) numbers is an understandable benefit, it's not like Fryman Canyon is what one would call a dangerous environment.      Believe it or not, McCarthy's business has already grown to at least five people other than himself, covering such areas like downtown L.A., Hollywood, Eagle Rock, Los Feliz and Fairfax. We're not sure whether or not People Walker offers its services along the Pacific Coast, or in the hills of the San Fernando Valley, but maybe it should.      As for why someone might want to hire a People Walker, McCarthy's got a handy Q&A; already set up!      Honestly, we've got no complaints here. While the fact that people are paying money because they're afraid others might see them walking alone and ostensibly think that they have no friends, anything that gets people out of their cars and into the splendor of Los Angeles' pedestrian environment is an undeniably good thing. Here's to the future of a pedestrian friendly Los Angeles where we're all escorted through the streets by People Walkers!      (h/t to Curbed) ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"So, you know how people sometimes hire other folks to walk their dogs, right? Well, there's a man named Chuck McCarthy who lives in Hollywood, and he's an actor. Now, acting work can sometimes be hard to come by, so Chuck needed another job to make some extra money. At first, he thought about being a dog walker, but then he didn't really like the idea of having to pick up dog poop. And then - here's the fun part - he had a really cool idea: if people hire dog walkers, why not hire a person to walk people? So that's what he did! He started a business where he walks with people, just like going for a stroll together, and he charges 7 for each mile they walk. It seems like a lot of people like this idea, because they sometimes feel lonely or don't feel safe walking alone. And for Chuck, it's like getting paid to exercise and make new friends!"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Considering this, Taylor now has a few options on what to do next: (i) Tear up the note: If Taylor believes that the contents of the note are no longer relevant or accurate, or if they changed their mind about sharing the information, they might choose to tear up the note. This would ensure that their friend never reads it, and they can move forward without any potentially negative consequences from the note being read. (ii) Give the note to their friend: If Taylor still feels that the information in the note is important and wants to share it with their friend, they could choose to give the note to their friend after all. This would show their vulnerability and honesty, and could potentially strengthen their relationship, provided the note's content is well-received by their friend. (iii) Decide they don't like the note: Taylor may decide that the note does not accurately convey the message they want to share with their friend. In this case, Taylor could choose to rewrite the note, making any necessary adjustments to better express their thoughts and feelings before giving it to their friend.

(CNN) -- The entire eastern coast of the United States should prepare for Irene, a large and dangerous hurricane churning northwestward over the tropical waters of the Caribbean, the nation's emergency chief warned Tuesday. At 8 p.m. ET, the National Hurricane Center said the winds in Irene remained unchanged from its previous update, at 90 mph, making the storm a Category 1 hurricane. However, the reduction is expected to be only temporary, and Irene is still forecast to become a Category 3 event, a major hurricane, by Wednesday night or Thursday, the center said. Irene was moving through the southern Bahamas and will pass very near or over the Turks and Caicos islands later Tuesday night, CNN Senior Meteorologist Dave Hennen said early Tuesday evening. \\"Quite frankly (the state's) emergency center has done this over and over and over, and we have the best system in OPTIONS: - Bahamas, we know that ... and that system is very, very robust and strong.\\" - CNN, we know that ... and that system is very, very robust and strong.\\" - Caicos islands, we know that ... and that system is very, very robust and strong.\\" - Caribbean, we know that ... and that system is very, very robust and strong.\\" - Dave Hennen, we know that ... and that system is very, very robust and strong.\\" - Irene, we know that ... and that system is very, very robust and strong.\\" - National Hurricane Center, we know that ... and that system is very, very robust and strong.\\" - North Carolina, we know that ... and that system is very, very robust and strong.\\" - Turks, we know that ... and that system is very, very robust and strong.\\" - United States, we know that ... and that system is very, very robust and strong.\\"","output":"- North Carolina, we know that ... and that system is very, very robust and strong.\\" The correct answer is North Carolina, which refers to the state's emergency center mentioned earlier in the story.

Information:  - Colorectal cancer (CRC), also known as bowel cancer, is the development of cancer from the colon or rectum (parts of the large intestine). A cancer is the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Signs and symptoms may include blood in the stool, a change in bowel movements, weight loss, and feeling tired all the time. Most colorectal cancers are due to old age and lifestyle factors with only a small number of cases due to underlying genetic disorders. Some risk factors include diet, obesity, smoking, and lack of physical activity. Dietary factors that increase the risk include red and processed meat as well as alcohol. Another risk factor is inflammatory bowel disease, which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Some of the inherited genetic disorders that can cause colorectal cancer include familial adenomatous polyposis and hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer; however, these represent less than 5% of cases. It typically starts as a benign tumor, often in the form of a polyp, which over time becomes cancerous. Bowel cancer may be diagnosed by obtaining a sample of the colon during a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. This is then followed by medical imaging to determine if the disease has spread. Screening is effective for preventing and decreasing deaths from colorectal cancer. Screening is recommended starting from the age of 50 to 75. During colonoscopy, small polyps may be removed if found. If a large polyp or tumor is found, a biopsy may be performed to check if it is cancerous. Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs decrease the risk. Their general use is not recommended for this purpose, however, due to side effects. Treatments used for colorectal cancer may include some combination of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Cancers that are confined within the wall of the colon may be curable with surgery while cancer that has spread widely are usually not curable, with management being directed...  - Breast cancer is cancer that develops from breast tissue. Signs of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, fluid coming from the nipple, or a red scaly patch of skin. In those with distant spread of the disease, there may be bone pain, swollen lymph nodes, shortness of breath, or yellow skin. Risk factors for developing breast cancer include being female, obesity, lack of physical exercise, drinking alcohol, hormone replacement therapy during menopause, ionizing radiation, early age at first menstruation, having children late or not at all, older age, and family history. About 510% of cases are due to genes inherited from a person's parents, including BRCA1 and BRCA2 among others. Breast cancer most commonly develops in cells from the lining of milk ducts and the lobules that supply the ducts with milk. Cancers developing from the ducts are known as ductal carcinomas, while those developing from lobules are known as lobular carcinomas. In addition, there are more than 18 other sub-types of breast cancer. Some cancers, such as ductal carcinoma in situ, develop from pre-invasive lesions. The diagnosis of breast cancer is confirmed by taking a biopsy of the concerning lump. Once the diagnosis is made, further tests are done to determine if the cancer has spread beyond the breast and which treatments it may respond to. The balance of benefits versus harms of breast cancer screening is controversial. A 2013 Cochrane review stated that it is unclear if mammographic screening does more good or harm. A 2009 review for the US Preventive Services Task Force found evidence of benefit in those 40 to 70 years of age, and the organization recommends screening every two years in women 50 to 74 years old. The medications tamoxifen or raloxifene may be used in an effort to prevent breast cancer in those who are at high risk of developing it. Surgical removal of both breasts is another preventative measure in some high risk women. In those who have been diagnosed with...  - Obesity is a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to the extent that it may have a negative effect on health. People are generally considered obese when their body mass index (BMI), a measurement obtained by dividing a person's weight by the square of the person's height, is over , with the range defined as overweight. Some East Asian countries use lower values. Obesity increases the likelihood of various diseases, particularly heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, certain types of cancer, and osteoarthritis. Obesity is most commonly caused by a combination of excessive food intake, lack of physical activity, and genetic susceptibility. A few cases are caused primarily by genes, endocrine disorders, medications, or mental illness. The view that obese people eat little yet gain weight due to a slow metabolism is not generally supported. On average, obese people have a greater energy expenditure than their thin counterparts due to the energy required to maintain an increased body mass. Obesity is mostly preventable through a combination of social changes and personal choices. Changes to diet and exercising are the main treatments. Diet quality can be improved by reducing the consumption of energy-dense foods, such as those high in fat and sugars, and by increasing the intake of dietary fiber. Medications may be taken, along with a suitable diet, to reduce appetite or decrease fat absorption. If diet, exercise, and medication are not effective, a gastric balloon or surgery may be performed to reduce stomach volume or bowel length, leading to feeling full earlier or a reduced ability to absorb nutrients from food. Obesity is a leading preventable cause of death worldwide, with increasing rates in adults and children. In 2014, 600 million adults (13%) and 42 million children under the age of five were obese. Obesity is more common in women than men. Authorities view it as one of the most serious public health problems of the 21st century. Obesity is stigmatized in much of...  - The Mesothelioma Applied Research Foundation ( Meso Foundation , formerly MARF ) is a non-profit organization that funds mesothelioma research , provides services to patients , educates the public , and advocates in Washington , DC for governmental funding for mesothelioma research . The organization 's mission is to eradicate mesothelioma , a cancer caused by exposure to asbestos , as a life - ending disease . Its donors include lawyers , companies that have manufactured asbestos products and victims , along with their family and friends . To date , the foundation has funded over  8.2 million in clinical research and is the host of the annual International Symposium on Malignant Mesothelioma .  - Lung cancer, also known as lung carcinoma, is a malignant lung tumor characterized by uncontrolled cell growth in tissues of the lung. If left untreated, this growth can spread beyond the lung by the process of metastasis into nearby tissue or other parts of the body. Most cancers that start in the lung, known as primary lung cancers, are carcinomas. The two main types are small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The most common symptoms are coughing (including coughing up blood), weight loss, shortness of breath, and chest pains. The vast majority (85%) of cases of lung cancer are due to long-term tobacco smoking. About 1015% of cases occur in people who have never smoked. These cases are often caused by a combination of genetic factors and exposure to radon gas, asbestos, second-hand smoke, or other forms of air pollution. Lung cancer may be seen on chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans. The diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy which is usually performed by bronchoscopy or CT-guidance. Prevention is by avoiding risk factors including smoking and air pollution. Treatment and long-term outcomes depend on the type of cancer, the stage (degree of spread), and the person's overall health. Most cases are not curable. Common treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. NSCLC is sometimes treated with surgery, whereas SCLC usually responds better to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Worldwide in 2012, lung cancer occurred in 1.8 million people and resulted in 1.6 million deaths. This makes it the most common cause of cancer-related death in men and second most common in women after breast cancer. The most common age at diagnosis is 70 years. Overall, 17.4% of people in the United States diagnosed with lung cancer survive five years after the diagnosis, while outcomes on average are worse in the developing world. Signs and symptoms. Signs and symptoms which may suggest lung cancer include:  - Stomach cancer, also known as gastric cancer, is cancer developing from the lining of the stomach. Early symptoms may include heartburn, upper abdominal pain, nausea and loss of appetite. Later signs and symptoms may include weight loss, yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, vomiting, difficulty swallowing, and blood in the stool among others. The cancer may spread from the stomach to other parts of the body, particularly the liver, lungs, bones, lining of the abdomen and lymph nodes. The most common cause is infection by the bacterium \\"Helicobacter pylori\\", which accounts for more than 60% of cases. Certain types of \\"H. pylori\\" have greater risks than others. Other common causes include eating pickled vegetables and smoking. About 10% of cases run in families and between 1% and 3% of cases are due to genetic syndromes inherited from a person's parents such as hereditary diffuse gastric cancer. Most cases of stomach cancers are gastric carcinomas. This type can be divided into a number of subtypes. Lymphomas and mesenchymal tumors may also develop in the stomach. Most of the time, stomach cancer develops in stages over years. Diagnosis is usually by biopsy done during endoscopy. This is followed by medical imaging to determine if the disease has spread to other parts of the body. Japan and South Korea, two countries that have high rates of the disease, screen for stomach cancer. A Mediterranean diet lowers the risk of cancer as does the stopping of smoking. There is tentative evidence that treating \\"H. pylori\\" decreases the future risk. If cancer is treated early, many cases can be cured. Treatments may include some combination of surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted therapy. If treated late, palliative care may be advised. Outcomes are often poor with a less than 10% 5-year survival rate globally. This is largely because most people with the condition present with advanced disease. In the United States 5-year survival is 28% while in South Korea it is over 65% partly due to...  - Silic (19952013) is a French Thoroughbred racehorse who competed both in France and in the United States. His most notable win came in the 1999 Breeders' Cup Mile.  - A brain tumor or intracranial neoplasm occurs when abnormal cells form within the brain. There are two main types of tumors: malignant or cancerous tumors and benign tumors. Cancerous tumors can be divided into primary tumors that start within the brain, and secondary tumors that have spread from somewhere else, known as brain metastasis tumors. All types of brain tumors may produce symptoms that vary depending on the part of the brain involved. These symptoms may include headaches, seizures, problem with vision, vomiting, and mental changes. The headache is classically worse in the morning and goes away with vomiting. More specific problems may include difficulty in walking, speaking, and with sensation. As the disease progresses unconsciousness may occur. The cause of most brain tumors is unknown. Uncommon risk factors include inherited neurofibromatosis, exposure to vinyl chloride, EpsteinBarr virus, and ionizing radiation. The evidence for mobile phones is not clear. The most common types of primary tumors in adults are meningiomas (usually benign), and astrocytomas such as glioblastomas. In children, the most common type is a malignant medulloblastoma. Diagnosis is usually by medical examination along with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. This is then often confirmed by a biopsy. Based on the findings, the tumors are divided into different grades of severity. Treatment may include some combination of surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Anticonvulsant medication may be needed if seizures occur. Dexamethasone and furosemide may be used to decrease swelling around the tumor. Some tumors grow gradually, requiring only monitoring and possibly needing no further intervention. Treatments that use a person's immune system are being studied. Outcome varies considerably depending on the type of tumor and how far it has spread at diagnosis. Glioblastomas usually have poor outcomes while meningiomas usually have good outcomes. The average five-year survival rate for brain cancer in the...  - Asbestos is a set of six naturally occurring silicate minerals, which all have in common their eponymous asbestiform habit: long (roughly 1:20 aspect ratio), thin fibrous crystals, with each visible fiber composed of millions of microscopic \\"fibrils\\" that can be released by abrasion and other processes. They are commonly known by their colors, as \\"blue asbestos\\", \\"brown asbestos\\", \\"white asbestos\\", and \\"green asbestos\\".  - Melanoma, also known as malignant melanoma, is a type of cancer that develops from the pigment-containing cells known as melanocytes. Melanomas typically occur in the skin but may rarely occur in the mouth, intestines, or eye. In women they most commonly occur on the legs, while in men they are most common on the back. Sometimes they develop from a mole with concerning changes including an increase in size, irregular edges, change in color, itchiness, or skin breakdown. The primary cause of melanoma is ultraviolet light (UV) exposure in those with low levels of skin pigment. The UV light may be from either the sun or from other sources, such as tanning devices. About 25% develop from moles. Those with many moles, a history of affected family members, and who have poor immune function are at greater risk. A number of rare genetic defects such as xeroderma pigmentosum also increase risk. Diagnosis is by biopsy of any concerning skin lesion. Using sunscreen and avoiding UV light may prevent melanoma. Treatment is typically removal by surgery. In those with slightly larger cancers, nearby lymph nodes may be tested for spread. Most people are cured if spread has not occurred. For those in whom melanoma has spread, immunotherapy, biologic therapy, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy may improve survival. With treatment the five-year survival rates in the United States is 98% among those with localized disease and 17% among those in whom spread has occurred. The likelihood that it will come back or spread depends how thick the melanoma is, how fast the cells are dividing, and whether or not the overlying skin has broken down. Melanoma is the most dangerous type of skin cancer. Globally, in 2012, it occurred in 232,000 people and resulted in 55,000 deaths. Australia and New Zealand have the highest rates of melanoma in the world. There are also high rates in Northern Europe and North America, while it is less common in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Melanoma is more common in men than women. Melanoma has become more...  - The brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals. The brain is located in the head, usually close to the sensory organs for senses such as vision. The brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body. In a human, the cerebral cortex contains approximately 1533 billion neurons, each connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons. These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons, which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells.  - Hepatitis B is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) which affects the liver. It can cause both acute and chronic infections. Many people have no symptoms during the initial infection. Some develop a rapid onset of sickness with vomiting, yellowish skin, tiredness, dark urine and abdominal pain. Often these symptoms last a few weeks and rarely does the initial infection result in death. It may take 30 to 180 days for symptoms to begin. In those who get infected around the time of birth 90% develop chronic while less than 10% of those infected after the age of five do. Most of those with chronic disease have no symptoms; however, cirrhosis and liver cancer may eventually develop. These complications result in the death of 15 to 25% of those with chronic disease. The virus is transmitted by exposure to infectious blood or body fluids. Infection around the time of birth or from contact with other people's blood during childhood is the most frequent method by which hepatitis B is acquired in areas where the disease is common. In areas where the disease is rare, intravenous drug use and sexual intercourse are the most frequent routes of infection. Other risk factors include working in healthcare, blood transfusions, dialysis, living with an infected person, travel in countries where the infection rate is high, and living in an institution. Tattooing and acupuncture led to a significant number of cases in the 1980s; however, this has become less common with improved sterility. The viruses cannot be spread by holding hands, sharing eating utensils, kissing, hugging, coughing, sneezing, or breastfeeding. The infection can be diagnosed 30 to 60 days after exposure. The diagnosis is usually confirmed by testing the blood for parts of the virus and for antibodies against the virus. It is one of five known hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E. The infection has been preventable by vaccination since 1982. Vaccination is recommended by the World Health Organization in the first day of life if...  - Mesothelioma is a type of cancer that develops from the thin layer of tissue that covers many of the internal organs (known as the mesothelium). The most common area affected is the lining of the lungs and chest wall. Less commonly the lining of the abdomen and rarely the sac surrounding the heart, or the sac surrounding the testis may be affected. Signs and symptoms of mesothelioma may include shortness of breath due to fluid around the lung, a swollen abdomen, chest wall pain, cough, feeling tired, and weight loss. These symptoms typically come on slowly. Greater than 80% of mesothelioma cases are caused by exposure to asbestos. The greater the exposure the greater the risk. As of 2013 about 125 million people have been exposed to asbestos at work. High rates of disease occur in people who mine asbestos, produce products from asbestos, work with asbestos products, live with asbestos workers, or work in buildings containing asbestos. Often it is around 40 years between exposure and the cancer starting. Washing the clothing of someone who worked with asbestos also increases the risk. Other risk factors include genetics and infection with the simian virus 40. The diagnosis may be suspected based on chest X-ray and CT scan findings, and is confirmed by either examining fluid produced by the cancer or by a tissue biopsy of the cancer. Prevention centers around reducing exposure to asbestos. Treatment often includes surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. A procedure known as pleurodesis, which involves using substances such as talc to scar together the pleura, may be used to prevent more fluid from building up around the lungs. Chemotherapy often includes the medications cisplatin and pemetrexed. The percentage of people that survive five years following diagnosis is on average 8% in the United States. In 2013 about 50,000 people had mesothelioma and 34,000 died from the disease. Rates of mesothelioma vary in different areas of the world. Rates are higher in Australia, the United Kingdom, and lower in...  - Palliative care is a multidisciplinary approach to specialized medical care for people with life-limiting illnesses. It focuses on providing people with relief from the symptoms, pain, physical stress, and mental stress of the terminal diagnosis. The goal of such therapy is to improve quality of life for both the person and their family. Evidence as of 2016 supports improvement in quality of life.  - Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a group of blood cancers that includes all types of lymphoma except Hodgkin's lymphomas. Symptoms include enlarged lymph nodes, fever, night sweats, weight loss, and feeling tired. Other symptoms may include bone pain, chest pain, or itchiness. Some forms are slow growing while others are fast growing. Lymphomas are types of cancer that develops from lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. Risk factors include poor immune function, autoimmune diseases, \\"Helicobacter pylori\\" infection, hepatitis C, obesity, and \\"Epstein-Barr virus\\" infection. The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies lymphomas into five major groups, including one for Hodgkin's lymphoma. Within the four groups for NHL there are over 60 specific types of lymphoma. Diagnosis is by examination of a bone marrow or lymph node biopsy. Medical imaging is done to help with cancer staging. Treatment depends on if the lymphoma is slow or fast growing and if it is in one area or many areas. Treatments may include chemotherapy, radiation, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, stem cell transplantation, surgery, or watchful waiting. If the blood becomes overly thick due to antibodies, plasmapheresis may be used. Radiation and some chemotherapy, however, increase the risk of other cancers, heart disease or nerve problems over the subsequent decades. In 2013 about 2.96 million people had non-Hodgkin lymphoma and 226,000 died. In the United States 2.1% of people are affected at some point in their life. The most common age of diagnosis is between 65 to 75 years old. The percentage of people who survive five years in the United States is 71%.  - Cancer is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Not all tumors are cancerous; benign tumors do not spread to other parts of the body. Possible signs and symptoms include a lump, abnormal bleeding, prolonged cough, unexplained weight loss and a change in bowel movements. While these symptoms may indicate cancer, they may have other causes. Over 100 types of cancers affect humans. Tobacco use is the cause of about 22% of cancer deaths. Another 10% is due to obesity, poor diet, lack of physical activity and drinking alcohol. Other factors include certain infections, exposure to ionizing radiation and environmental pollutants. In the developing world nearly 20% of cancers are due to infections such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human papillomavirus (HPV). These factors act, at least partly, by changing the genes of a cell. Typically many genetic changes are required before cancer develops. Approximately 510% of cancers are due to inherited genetic defects from a person's parents. Cancer can be detected by certain signs and symptoms or screening tests. It is then typically further investigated by medical imaging and confirmed by biopsy. Many cancers can be prevented by not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, not drinking too much alcohol, eating plenty of vegetables, fruits and whole grains, vaccination against certain infectious diseases, not eating too much processed and red meat, and avoiding too much sunlight exposure. Early detection through screening is useful for cervical and colorectal cancer. The benefits of screening in breast cancer are controversial. Cancer is often treated with some combination of radiation therapy, surgery, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. Pain and symptom management are an important part of care. Palliative care is particularly important in people with advanced disease. The chance of survival depends on the type of cancer and extent of disease at the start of treatment. In children under 15 at...  - The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.<ref name=\\"doi10.1146/annurev-astro-081913-040012\\"></ref> It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. About three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.  - Skin cancers are cancers that arise from the skin. They are due to the development of abnormal cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. There are three main types of skin cancers: basal-cell skin cancer (BCC), squamous-cell skin cancer (SCC) and melanoma. The first two together along with a number of less common skin cancers are known as nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC). Basal-cell cancer grows slowly and can damage the tissue around it but is unlikely to spread to distant areas or result in death. It often appears as a painless raised area of skin, that may be shiny with small blood vessel running over it or may present as a raised area with an ulcer. Squamous-cell cancer is more likely to spread. It usually presents as a hard lump with a scaly top but may also form an ulcer. Melanomas are the most aggressive. Signs include a mole that has changed in size, shape, color, has irregular edges, has more than one color, is itchy or bleeds. Greater than 90% of cases are caused by exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. This exposure increases the risk of all three main types of skin cancer. Exposure has increased partly due to a thinner ozone layer. Tanning beds are becoming another common source of ultraviolet radiation. For melanomas and basal-cell cancers exposure during childhood is particularly harmful. For squamous-cell cancers total exposure, irrespective of when it occurs, is more important. Between 20% and 30% of melanomas develop from moles. People with light skin are at higher risk as are those with poor immune function such as from medications or HIV/AIDS. Diagnosis is by biopsy. Decreasing exposure to ultraviolet radiation and the use of sunscreen appear to be effective methods of preventing melanoma and squamous-cell cancer. It is not clear if sunscreen affects the risk of basal-cell cancer. Nonmelanoma skin cancer is usually curable. Treatment is generally by surgical removal but may less commonly involve radiation therapy or topical medications such as...  - Ionizing radiation (ionising radiation) is radiation that carries enough energy to free electrons from atoms or molecules, thereby ionizing them. Ionizing radiation is made up of energetic subatomic particles, ions or atoms moving at high speeds (usually greater than 1% of the speed of light), and electromagnetic waves on the high-energy end of the electromagnetic spectrum.  - Lymphoma is a group of blood cell tumors that develop from lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). The name often refers to just the cancerous ones rather than all such tumors. Signs and symptoms may include enlarged lymph nodes, fever, drenching sweats, unintended weight loss, itching, and constantly feeling tired. The enlarged lymph nodes are usually painless. The sweats are most common at night. There are dozens of subtypes of lymphomas. The two main categories of lymphomas are Hodgkin's lymphomas (HL) and the non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). The World Health Organization (WHO) includes two other categories as types of lymphoma: multiple myeloma and immunoproliferative diseases. About 90% of lymphomas are non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Lymphomas and leukemias are a part of the broader group of tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues. Risk factors for Hodgkin lymphoma include infection with EpsteinBarr virus and a history of the disease in the family. Risk factors for common types of non-Hodgkin lymphomas include autoimmune diseases, HIV/AIDS, infection with human T-lymphotropic virus, immunosuppressant medications, and some pesticides. Eating large amounts of red meat and tobacco smoking may also increase the risk. Diagnosis, if enlarged lymph nodes are present, is usually by lymph node biopsy. Blood, urine, and bone marrow testing may also be useful in the diagnosis. Medical imaging may then be done to determine if and where the cancer has spread. Lymphoma most often spreads to the lungs, liver, and/or brain. Treatment may involve one or more of the following: chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, and surgery. In some non-Hodgkin lymphomas, an increased amount of protein produced by the lymphoma cells causes the blood to become so thick that plasmapheresis is performed to remove the protein. Watchful waiting may be appropriate for certain types. The outcome depends on the subtype with some being curable and treatment prolonging survival in most. The five-year survival rate in the United States...  - Hepatitis C is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) that primarily affects the liver. During the initial infection people often have mild or no symptoms. Occasionally a fever, dark urine, abdominal pain, and yellow tinged skin occurs. The virus persists in the liver in about 75% to 85% of those initially infected. Early on chronic infection typically has no symptoms. Over many years however, it often leads to liver disease and occasionally cirrhosis. In some cases, those with cirrhosis will develop complications such as liver failure, liver cancer, or esophageal and gastric varices. HCV is spread primarily by blood-to-blood contact associated with intravenous drug use, poorly sterilized medical equipment, needlestick injuries in healthcare, and transfusions. Using blood screening, the risk from a transfusion is less than one per two million. It may also be spread from an infected mother to her baby during birth. It is not spread by superficial contact. It is one of five known hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E. Diagnosis is by blood testing to look for either antibodies to the virus or its RNA. Testing is recommended in all people who are at risk. There is no vaccine against hepatitis C. Prevention includes harm reduction efforts among people who use intravenous drugs and testing donated blood. Chronic infection can be cured about 90% of the time with treatments that include the medications sofosbuvir or simeprevir. Previous to this a combination of peginterferon and ribavirin was used which had a cure rate around 50% and greater side effects. Getting access to the newer treatments however can be expensive. Those who develop cirrhosis or liver cancer may require a liver transplant. Hepatitis C is the leading reason for liver transplantation, though the virus usually recurs after transplantation. An estimated 130200 million people worldwide are infected with hepatitis C. In 2013 about 11 million new cases occurred. It occurs most commonly in Africa and Central and East Asia. About...  - Cervical cancer is a cancer arising from the cervix. It is due to the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Early on, typically no symptoms are seen. Later symptoms may include abnormal vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain, or pain during sexual intercourse. While bleeding after sex may not be serious, it may also indicate the presence of cervical cancer. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection appears to be involved in the development of more than 90% of cases; most people who have had HPV infections, however, do not develop cervical cancer. Other risk factors include smoking, a weak immune system, birth control pills, starting sex at a young age, and having many sexual partners, but these are less important. Cervical cancer typically develops from precancerous changes over 10 to 20 years. About 90% of cervical cancer cases are squamous cell carcinomas, 10% are adenocarcinoma, and a small number are other types. Diagnosis is typically by cervical screening followed by a biopsy. Medical imaging is then done to determine whether or not the cancer has spread. HPV vaccines protect against between two and seven high-risk strains of this family of viruses and may prevent up to 90% of cervical cancers. As a risk of cancer still exists, guidelines recommend continuing regular Pap smears. Other methods of prevention include: having few or no sexual partners and the use of condoms. Cervical cancer screening using the Pap smear or acetic acid can identify precancerous changes which when treated can prevent the development of cancer. Treatment of cervical cancer may consist of some combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Five year survival rates in the United States are 68%. Outcomes, however, depend very much on how early the cancer is detected. Worldwide, cervical cancer is both the fourth-most common cause of cancer and the fourth-most common cause of death from cancer in women. In 2012, an estimated 528,000 cases of cervical cancer occurred, with 266,000...  - Prostate cancer, also known as carcinoma of the prostate, is the development of cancer in the prostate, a gland in the male reproductive system. Most prostate cancers are slow growing; however, some grow relatively quickly. The cancer cells may spread from the prostate to other parts of the body, particularly the bones and lymph nodes. It may initially cause no symptoms. In later stages it can lead to difficulty urinating, blood in the urine, or pain in the pelvis, back or when urinating. A disease known as benign prostatic hyperplasia may produce similar symptoms. Other late symptoms may include feeling tired due to low levels of red blood cells. Factors that increase the risk of prostate cancer include: older age, a family history of the disease, and race. About 99% of cases occur in those over the age of 50. Having a first-degree relative with the disease increases the risk two to threefold. In the United States it is more common in the African American population than the white American population. Other factors that may be involved include a diet high in processed meat, red meat, or milk products or low in certain vegetables. An association with gonorrhea has been found, but a reason for this relationship has not been identified. Prostate cancer is diagnosed by biopsy. Medical imaging may then be done to determine if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. Prostate cancer screening is controversial. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing increases cancer detection but does not decrease mortality. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends against screening using the PSA test, due to the risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment, as most cancer diagnosed would remain asymptomatic. The USPSTF concludes that the potential benefits of testing do not outweigh the expected harms. While 5-reductase inhibitors appear to decrease low-grade cancer risk they do not affect high-grade cancer risk and thus are not recommended for prevention. Supplementation with vitamins or minerals does not...    What object entity has the relation of 'inception' with the subject 'mesothelioma applied research foundation'?

I don't think it's a problem to have a blank wall.”      —Annie Leibovitz      According to a legend that one of us (Martinez-Conde) heard growing up in Spain, anybody can see the Devil's face. All you need to do is to stare at your own face in the mirror at the stroke of midnight, call the Devil's name and the Prince of Darkness will look back at you. Needless to say, I was both fascinated and terrified by the possibility. And I knew this was an experiment I must try. I waited a day or two to gather my courage, then stayed awake until midnight, got up from my bed, and into the bathroom I went. I closed the door behind me so that my family would not hear me calling out loud for Satan, faced my wide-eyed reflection, made my invocation, and ... nothing happened. I was disenchanted (literally) but also quite relieved.      Now, three decades later, a paper entitled “Strange-Face-in-the-Mirror Illusion,” by vision scientist Giovanni B. Caputo of the University of Urbino in Italy, may explain my lack of results. Caputo asked 50 subjects to gaze at their reflected faces in a mirror for a 10-minute session. After less than a minute, most observers began to perceive the “strange-face illusion.” The participants' descriptions included huge deformations of their own faces; seeing the faces of alive or deceased parents; archetypal faces such as an old woman, child or the portrait of an ancestor; animal faces such as a cat, pig or lion; and even fantastical and monstrous beings. All 50 participants reported feelings of “otherness” when confronted with a face that seemed suddenly unfamiliar. Some felt powerful emotions.      After reading Caputo's article, I had to give “Satan” another try. I suspected that my failure to see anything other than my petrified self in the mirror 30 years ago had to do with suboptimal lighting conditions for the strange-face illusion to take place. Caputo recommended dim lighting, so that observers might see their facial features in detail but experience attenuated color perception. So this time I turned off the bathroom lights and turned on my cell phone's flashlight, then placed it on the floor behind me, so that I could not see its reflection on the mirror. Then I looked at myself and waited.      My efforts were rewarded quickly. Portions of my face started to disappear, contract or expand, and suddenly all the features would come back, giving me a bit of a start. I was particularly thrilled to experience some of the dissociative identity effect that the experimental participants reported, feeling as if the face staring back at me was both mine and yet not mine. Disappointingly, I did not see any monstrous creatures or ghosts of ancestors calling me from the beyond (or even Satan, for that matter), but I think I came close to seeing one of the “archetypal” faces. Weirdly, halfway through the experiment, my face appeared to morph into a sepia portrait of an old Native American warrior. But as soon as it arrived, it was gone.      Fade to Gray      Why does this happen? To explain, we need to start with Erasmus Darwin, the English natural philosopher and physician and grandfather of Charles Darwin. In the late 18th century he described how objects can fade after steady gazing: “On looking long on an area of scarlet silk of about an inch in diameter laid on white paper ... the scarlet color becomes fainter, till at length it entirely vanishes, though the eye is kept uniformly and steadily upon it.” Swiss philosopher Ignaz Paul Vital Troxler later corroborated Darwin's observations, using colored patches on a wall. The phenomenon became known as Troxler fading.      Neural adaptation, the mechanism by which neurons decrease or stop their response to unchanging stimulation, is thought to underlie perceptual fading during prolonged gazing at an object or scene. Once the target of interest has vanished, blinks, gaze shifts and even microscopic involuntary eye movements called microsaccades can restore it to perception instantly [see “Shifting Focus,” by Susana Martinez-Conde and Stephen L. Macknik; Scientific American Mind, November/December 2011].      Troxler fading and neural adaptation may partly explain Caputo's strange-face illusion. As we gaze long and steady into our reflected face, the unchanging nature of the visual stimulus causes facial features to disappear and then reappear, as we blink or make involuntary eye movements, thereby “refreshing” our neuronal responses. In the absence of visual information, our brain will “fill in” the gaps according to our experiences, expectations, best guesses, and even hardwired neural mechanisms involved in shape and face perception. The result can be amusing or disquieting.      A few years ago I had the opportunity to collaborate with cognitive scientist Daniel Simons (author, with Christopher Chabris, of The Invisible Gorilla, Random House, 2010) and his colleagues at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign on an experiment to investigate visual fading in entire scenes. You can experience the effect by focusing your gaze precisely at the center of the blurry image, while paying attention to the entire scene. Careful staring for just a few seconds will minimize your eye movements, causing the scene to fade to gray. Now stop focusing your gaze, and the scene will come right back. Scientists can make nonblurred scenes fade in the laboratory by completely removing or by compensating for the observer's eye movements.      A Fading Impression      Impression, Sunrise, by French painter Claude Monet in 1872, gave its name to the Impressionist movement. The subject of the painting is the harbor of Le Havre in France, as seen from Monet's window. It was not, however, Monet's actual view of the scene, as he later explained, but his “impression”—hence the title. Indeed, Sunrise does not accurately represent reality: the rising sun appears much brighter than the surrounding sky, as it should in real life, but that perception is an illusion. Monet used pigments of matching luminance, or brightness, but different chromatic content, or hues, to represent the sun and the sky. Harvard University neurobiologist Margaret Livingstone has proposed that this equiluminant quality, where objects in the image have the same luminance as the background, is what gives the sun its eerie, almost pulsating, lifelike appearance. A black-and-white reproduction reveals that the sun has the same physical luminance as the background clouds.      Equiluminant objects are somewhat difficult to see, which makes them more susceptible to Troxler fading. Neuro-ophthalmologists Avinoam B. Safran and Theodor Landis of Geneva University Hospital in Switzerland noticed that if you fix your gaze on the image of the sailor in Monet's painting for several seconds, while paying attention to the sun, the solar disk will disappear progressively, being replaced by the surrounding sky.      How Many Dots?      This pattern, generated by vision scientist Akiyoshi Kitaoka of Ritsumeikan University in Japan, contains a yellow dot at the center of each set of four blue “petals.” That makes a total of 61 yellow dots! To prove it to yourself, examine each “flower” in turn and see that all of them contain a centralyellow spot. The problem is that you can see only one spot at a time. The othersdisappear when you are not looking at them directly.      Lurking Ladybugs      In the left image of the pair that makes up this illusion, also by Kitaoka, each of the four squares in the corners has three ladybugs. The little insects are easy to see as you look around the image, but when you stare at the center of the pattern they vanish immediately. The right-hand image shows they do not become invisible by virtue of the small size: in the absence of the squares, all 12 ladybugs are perceptually prominent, no matter where in the image you look.      The Healing Grid      This illusion, created by cognitive neuroscientist Ryota Kanai, then at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, was a top-10 finalist in the 2005 Best Illusion of the Year Contest (http://illusionoftheyear.com). Explore the image freely, and you will see a regular pattern of intersecting horizontal and vertical lines in the center, flanked by an irregular grid of misaligned crosses to the left and right. Choose one of the intersections on the center of the image and stare at it for 30 seconds or so. You will see that the grid “heals” itself, becoming perfectly regular all the way through. The illusion results from both perceptual fading and the ensuing neural guesstimates that our brain imposes to “fill in” the outer parts of the image based on the available information from the center, in addition to our nervous system's intrinsic tendency to seek structure and order, even when the sensory input is fundamentally disorganized.      Beauty in the Eye of the Beholder      Artwork may contain “errors” that are obvious to our central vision but become invisible when viewed from the corner of our eye. Neuroscientist Denis Pelli of New York University discovered that Pablo Picasso's Maquette for Guitar (1912) appears absurd only when we look at it directly: the strings are torn and twisted, the neck is crooked, and the body is split into disconnected pieces. But now focus on the cross, while still paying attention to the guitar: all you can see is the smooth curves and elegant angles of a beautiful instrument. Pelli hypothesizes that the illusion works because our peripheral vision confuses the locations of the parts. Failure to notice the errors in the maquette produces the perception of a real guitar. Picasso's paintings of Nusch Éluard, a French acrobat, show a similar phenomenon. When viewed directly, the portraits are grotesque, but when seen peripherally, the young woman looks exquisite. Pelli suspects that Picasso was well aware of this effect. ||||| I just took a brief hallucination break with a colleague. We stepped into a supply closet, dimmed the lights, sat down, and watched one another’s faces morph into those of lionesses. I cried the whole time. Then we went back to work.      We were testing out a theory, reported in IFL Science, that staring into someone’s eyes for ten minutes can have LSD-like hallucinogenic effects, and found that, whoa: Indeed it can.      Giovanni Caputo, a researcher at the University of Urbino in Italy, paired up 20 people, had them stare into one another’s eyes in a dimly lit room for ten minutes, and reported on the results in Psychiatry Research. Caputo’s subjects reported some pretty strange effects, including out-of-body experiences and seeing monsters or dead people.      So when my co-worker Lauren Brown arrived this morning, I asked her: “Can I look into your eyes for ten minutes?”      “I thought you’d never ask,” she laughed.      I set about approximating the conditions of Caputo’s study, which was a bit like creating a make-out room for a game of “Seven Minutes in Heaven,” only in my workplace.      I dragged two chairs into a large closet and with a small desk lamp behind some boxes as the only source of light, made the room dim enough that I couldn’t perceive color, but was still able to discern details a few feet away from me. I put my phone on airplane mode and brought in Lauren. We sat down and set the timer.      Dramatization of real events. (Quartz/Mia Mabanta)      Lauren has a fairly intense gaze that’s symmetrically framed by striking, full eyebrows. The moment we sat down in the dark, that was the first thing that struck me, and then the giggles, which she got too. After a few long seconds, we settled into our places. I watched the smile fade from Lauren’s face, and felt sucked into her eyes. The bottom of her face started to elongate, and the highlights on her cheeks started to look like some kind of war paint or tribal markings. It occurred to me that she looked like a Native American chieftain.      Then my phone fell off the camera bag it was sitting on, and smacked onto the floor. I broke our stare to pick it up and restart the timer. It had been about 30 seconds. We started again.      Now we settled more quickly, and again I felt totally sucked into Lauren’s eyes, and very calm. I’m not much of a meditator—my earnest attempt with Headspace was rather short-lived—but I quickly fell into what I would call a meditative state. Thoughts floated in and out of my brain, but I felt like I was observing them, more than actively thinking them, like: Oh, that’s interesting. Now I’m wondering whether Lauren engages in facial contouring. Her cheekbones look so bright.      Very early on, my left eye started to water. A tear filled it up and rolled down my cheek. I brushed it away, and then worried that may have distracted Lauren. Then another one came, and I just let it roll all the way down to my neck. Then my right eye started too. Was I forgetting to blink? I was blinking, but the tears didn’t stop. They didn’t feel like emotional tears, but more like the ones that stream down my face on windy winter days.      But then, wait a minute. Was Lauren crying? It looked like her eyes were welling up, and it seemed like the corners of her mouth turned down. I felt there was a lot of emotion behind her eyes, and I just kept staring into them. Lauren has survived breast cancer, and it occurred to me that this could be a space where intense thoughts could creep in.      A few minutes later, she giggled.      Lauren’s chieftain face never came back, but her nose and mouth started to disappear, and were soon replaced with the muzzle of a large cat, like a mountain lion. (Seriously.) The whites of her eyes looked bright in the darkness, still framed by her eyebrows.      The timer went off.      “That went really fast,” I said.      “That went so fast!” she agreed.      We turned on the lights and stayed in the closet for a debriefing.      “That was really fucking weird,” I said. She agreed. I asked if she noticed my eyes watering the whole time. She hadn’t. I told her I didn’t feel emotional at all, but the tears just wouldn’t stop. It made me think of the Marina Abramovic performance piece, The Artist is Present, in which many of participants cried when faced with the silent, sitting Abramovic.      I told Lauren it looked like she was welling up a couple of times. She said she wasn’t at all. “I think you were projecting,” she said.      Then she told me why she laughed halfway through our sitting. “You started to look like a weird little animal!” she said.      “YOU started to look like an animal!” I shrieked. “A lion!”      “You were a lion!” she yelled. “A lioness,” she corrected herself.      We continued our very scientific analysis this way (unlike the subjects of Caputo’s study, who answered questions on a five-point scale, presumably not shrieking in a closet).      Lauren also said my face faded into a black silhouette, surrounded by blue light—and that at one point, it occurred to her that my face, in the dark, looked like death. I tried not to take this personally. “But not like you were dead,” she said.      We emerged from the closet, and I looked at Caputo’s study in detail. Other subjects, it turned out, had reported seeing animals (30%) or the face of someone of a differing race (7%). A striking 75% said they saw the face of a monster. No one reported projecting emotions onto their staring partner, but that may be because Caputo didn’t ask.      Still, Lauren and my experience was probably more than a little different from those who participated in Caputo’s study—and not just because we were in a supply closet. We sat down as friends and colleagues who are comfortable with one another, not strangers. It made me think of The New York Times story (paywall) about falling in love with a stranger by answering personal questions while gazing into their eyes.      I wouldn’t say Lauren and I fell in love, but we did share something quite cool: A perception-shifting experience; a quiet space to sit with our thoughts, away from the internet; and a lot of laughs afterward. What’s more, it only took ten minutes, it was free, and we have no hangover to show for it.      I highly recommend finding a friend and a dark room, and taking ten minutes to try this out. Who knows what could happen? ||||| Write a summary.","output":"A study by Giovanni Caputo in Psychiatry Research suggests that staring into someone's eyes for ten minutes can have hallucinogenic effects similar to taking LSD. In the experiment, 20 participants gazed into each other's eyes in a dimly lit room for ten minutes. The majority of them reported strange effects, such as out-of-body experiences, seeing monstrous creatures, or deceased individuals. This phenomenon may be partly explained by Troxler fading and neural adaptation - the mechanism by which neurons decrease or stop their responses to unchanging stimulation. As facial features disappear and reappear, the brain \\"fills in\\" the gaps according to experiences and expectations, causing these hallucinations or illusions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: The address I had been given was a flophouse called Casa Salvador in the scummy side of downtown, the part where the city's redevelopment (read: \\"gentrification\\") efforts hadn't yet managed to drive out the sundry undesirable elements. I walked inside past the front lobby. I could tell the desk manager wanted to hassle me, but he was too busy arguing with a middle-aged peroxide-blonde woman in a leopard-print top. Her skin was leathery and weather beaten, and I guessed she was the type who was actually a good ten years younger than she looked. I made my way up the narrow staircase that smelled of urine and bleach, going all the way to the third floor. I continued down the dimly lit hallway, past a series of closed doors that muffled the sounds of women faking moans of pleasure. Room 313 was down at the far end of the hall, and its door was already slightly ajar. I knocked anyways, but there was no answer. Pushing the door open just enough to poke my head in, I called, \\"Hello? Is anybody in there?\\" There was no response, so I went in and felt along the wall for the light switch. A single weak bulb came on, lighting up the tiny, sparse room with a dim yellow glow. The room was about 8 feet by 8 feet, and the only furniture was a dingy, unmade bed and a metal foot locker. There were no windows, no closet, and no bathroom. As I stepped all the way in, I noticed a wooden baseball bat propped up beside the door. My watch said 6:20 - twenty minutes late for the interview. I sat on the edge of the bed to wait, hoping that maybe my contact had just stepped out momentarily. After a few minutes, a phone started ringing out in the hallway. I let it ring six times with no one answering before I decided to get it - partly in the off chance it was my contact, but mostly out of morbid curiosity as to what kind of business someone would have calling this dump.

Both of these sentences refer to a small, singular particle of a larger substance. In these cases, \\"grain\\" is used as a unit of measurement to identify one small part of a whole.

In my opinion, it's better to improve it. Compared with He Garden, the map on the back of the ticket for He Garden is much clearer, more detailed and more useful. However, in the room that has the picture of the family members, there is only Chinese, no English, so my advice is to add English in interesting places. I got lost in the Slender West Lake. I spent about 30 minutes just trying to get out of one area. I think they need more signs posted along the trails. I like the Slender West Lake best, as she is so pretty! The ladies that were sweeping were very sweet. They always smiled at me and said hello, so it was nice. Taking a taxi is the most efficient  and quickest way to get around Yangzhou. I didn't have a problem getting to the places which I'd like to go to while using a taxi. The driver was very friendly. The fare isn't too high, either. But I didn't enjoy taking the bus. The bus ride to the Mastixia Bay   took long although I only had to pay one yuan. It was also hard finding where Bus 32 was. I tried asking some people in English but they couldn't understand me, so I had to ask in simple Chinese that I only know buy that still didn't work. I spent about one hour walking around the city to look for Bus 32. The tricycle  was nice, but it was a little too expensive for a small distance. Maybe I was _ by the guy who rode for me, but it was an enjoyable ride. I felt like I was part of the garden city more. Over all I am satisfied with Yangzhou and will recommend it to others.

The context of the sentence seems to imply that the subject being described possesses qualities or characteristics highly-suited for a person who plays ball. In order to better understand the sentiment, it is essential to analyze the elements of the sentence. 1. Positive lexical choice: The adjective \\"perfect\\" conveys a sense of excellence or suitability, indicating that the person being described possesses qualities that align well with what is expected or desired from a ballplayer. By using the word \\"perfect,\\" the speaker or writer is expressing their admiration and appreciation for those qualities. 2. Subject focus: \\"For a ballplayer\\" suggests that the person in question is involved in sports, specifically ball games. This context emphasizes the positive sentiment, as the speaker seems to admire the individual's talents and abilities relative to that specific domain. 3. Comparative element: Although there is no explicit comparison made with other ballplayers, the sense of perfection implies that the individual stands out against their peers or others in the same field. This contrast serves to strengthen the positive sentiment being conveyed, as it highlights the exceptionalism of the individual being described. 4. Implication of recognition: The sentence hints at a level of acknowledgement or acclaim for the individual. The fact that the person is being called \\"perfect\\" suggests that they may have already achieved a measure of success or recognition within their specific sports domain, further emphasizing the positive sentiment. Based on these elements, it can be concluded that the sentiment of the sentence \\"so perfect for a ballplayer\\" is predominantly positive and appreciative. The expression highlights the individual's talents, skills, and achievements, making them stand out as exceptional and admirable in the context of their sport."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Fact: the amount of daylight is greatest on the summer solstice Question: Opposite the winter solstice, the summer solstice features What's the answer? Available choices:  * longer daylight.  * less daylight.  * brighter fires.  * more darkness.","output":"The answer to the question, \\"Opposite the winter solstice, the summer solstice features,\\" is: * longer daylight. The summer solstice, which typically occurs around June 20th or 21st in the Northern Hemisphere and December 21st or 22nd in the Southern Hemisphere, marks the start of summer and the day with the longest period of daylight in the year. It is the point when the Earth is tilted most towards the Sun, resulting in the Sun reaching its highest point in the sky. This causes the day to have the greatest number of daylight hours and the shortest length of nighttime during the entire year. On the other hand, the winter solstice, which generally occurs around December 21st or 22nd in the Northern Hemisphere and June 20th or 21st in the Southern Hemisphere, denotes the official beginning of winter and the day with the shortest period of daylight. The Earth is tilted furthest away from the Sun during the winter solstice, causing the Sun to appear at its lowest point in the sky and the day to have the fewest daylight hours and the longest duration of nighttime throughout the year. The longer daylight during the summer solstice is caused by the tilt of the Earth's axis, which influences the angle and position of sunlight hitting the planet. During the summer solstice, the Earth's North Pole is tilted towards the Sun in the Northern Hemisphere, resulting in more direct sunlight and longer daylight hours. In the Southern Hemisphere, it's the Earth's South Pole that is tilted towards the Sun, causing the same effect of extended daylight. In contrast, the other available choices, \\"less daylight,\\" \\"brighter fires,\\" and \\"more darkness,\\" do not accurately represent the features of the summer solstice. \\"Less daylight\\" and \\"more darkness\\" are features of the winter solstice, while \\"brighter fires\\" is unrelated to the characteristics of the summer solstice, which is primarily known for its extended daylight hours."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

What is the answer?","output":"A Bellini cocktail is a classic and elegant drink that has been enjoyed by people all around the world since its creation in the 1940s. The Bellini was first invented by Giuseppe Cipriani, the founder of Harry's Bar in Venice, Italy, and is named after the famous Italian Renaissance painter Giovanni Bellini, as its color reminded Cipriani of the hue in one of Bellini's paintings. To make a Bellini cocktail, the fruit juice that is traditionally added to champagne is peach purée or peach nectar. Peach purée can be prepared by using fresh, ripe peaches. They are first peeled, pitted, and then blended or mashed until a smooth consistency is achieved. However, if fresh peaches are not available or are out of season, it is also possible to use high-quality store-bought peach purée or nectar. In the original recipe, Giuseppe Cipriani used white peaches, which were abundant in the region, and the sweetness and delicate flavor of these peaches contributed to the refreshing character of the drink. Generally, white peaches are preferred for making Bellinis due to their lower acidity and more subtle flavor compared to yellow peaches. To prepare a Bellini, the following proportions are typically used: - 2 parts Prosecco or Champagne (preferably chilled) - 1 part peach purée or nectar (chilled) Pour the peach purée or nectar into a champagne flute or wine glass and then gently top it off with the Prosecco or Champagne. To ensure that the drink maintains its beautiful color and does not become overly frothy, it's best to pour the sparkling wine slowly, allowing it to run down the side of the glass. Once the drink has been mixed, it's ready to serve and enjoy. Over the years, several variations of the Bellini have also been developed, featuring different fruit juices such as strawberry, mango, or even raspberry purées. Nonetheless, the peach Bellini remains the original and most iconic version of this cocktail, a perfect accompaniment for celebrations or simply when enjoying an indulgent, refreshing treat."},{"instruction":"Use information from the paragraph to answer the question.

Antiviral drugs are medications used specifically for treating the symptoms of viral infections. The first antiviral drug was interferon , a substance that is naturally produced by certain immune cells when an infection is detected. Over the past twenty years the development of antiretroviral drugs (also known as antiretroviral therapy, or ART) has increased rapidly. This has been driven by the AIDS epidemic.

Write an article based on this \\"The oil and gas industry has responded \\"strongly\\" to the latest offshore licensing round.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Robust Response to Latest Offshore Licensing Round Highlights Strength and Adaptability of Oil and Gas Industry Introduction The oil and gas industry has shown its resilience and adaptability once again, responding \\"strongly\\" to the latest offshore licensing round. This robust response demonstrates the sector's continued resolve to seek new opportunities for growth and innovation, despite the challenges faced in recent years due to market volatility, geopolitical tensions, and the ongoing energy transition. In this article, we will be analyzing the factors that have contributed to this strong response and discuss the implications for the industry's future. Economic Factors Driving Strong Response 1. Growing demand for oil and natural gas: Despite a concerted push for renewable and alternative energy sources, the global demand for oil and natural gas has remained strong. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a temporary dip in demand, but as economies slowly recover, energy consumption is set to rise once again. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global energy needs will increase 30% by 2040, with much of this demand being met by oil and natural gas. 2. Advances in technology and cost-effective exploration: Over the years, the oil and gas industry has made significant strides in developing new technology and increasing the efficiency of exploration and extraction processes. This has allowed for access to previously unattainable, deeper resources and has significantly brought down the break-even costs of new projects, making these ventures more economically viable. 3. Encouraging national energy policies: Governments around the world are implementing incentives and providing support to the oil and gas industry in terms of favorable tax regimes, financing solutions, and streamlined regulatory procedures. These actions are designed to promote licensing round competition and provide a stable business environment, fostering more significant investment in the sector. Industry Dynamics and Competitive Landscape A greater focus on collaboration and alliance-building is another key factor behind the strong response to the licensing round. In the face of growing complexity and uncertainty in the market, companies have become more open to pursuing partnerships, joint ventures, and strategic alliances to share costs, risks, and technology resources. These collaborations help companies to leverage diversified strengths and facilitate access to new opportunities across borders. Furthermore, many large international oil companies (IOCs) are taking a step back from the traditional offshore oil and gas projects to focus on renewable energy sources. This has opened up opportunities for medium-sized and smaller companies to step in and take advantage of the offshore licensing rounds. The situation not only increases the number of stakeholders in the sector but also fosters innovation and market dynamism. Implications for the Industry's Future The strong response to the latest offshore licensing round signifies the vitality of the oil and gas industry and provides a glimpse of its potential trajectory in the coming years. Key takeaways that point to an optimistic future for the sector include: 1. The continued exploration of new opportunities and resilience of the industry in the face of market challenges. 2. The government and industry collaboration will help provide a conducive environment for investments and encourage further licensing round activities. 3. Partnerships and alliances built during the licensing round process will likely lead to more technological advancements and better management of project risks. 4. A more diversified competitive landscape can be expected as medium-sized and smaller oil and gas firms take on a more crucial role in offshore resource exploration. Conclusion In summary, the oil and gas industry's response to the latest offshore licensing round underlines its adaptability and commitment to pursuing growth opportunities in a rapidly changing energy market. The strong response demonstrates the sector's ability to manage risks and face challenges head-on and portends a bright future for the industry as it continues to explore and develop new energy resources to meet the world's ever-increasing demands."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a question about the following article: The violence and terror of Pontiac's War convinced many western Pennsylvanians that their government was not doing enough to protect them. This discontent was manifested most seriously in an uprising led by a vigilante group that came to be known as the Paxton Boys, so-called because they were primarily from the area around the Pennsylvania village of Paxton . The Paxtonians turned their anger towards Native Americans—many of them Christians—who lived peacefully in small enclaves in the midst of white Pennsylvania settlements. Prompted by rumors that a Native war party had been seen at the Native village of Conestoga, on December 14, 1763, a group of more than 50 Paxton Boys marched on the village and murdered the six Susquehannocks they found there. Pennsylvania officials placed the remaining 16 Susquehannocks in protective custody in Lancaster, but on December 27 the Paxton Boys broke into the jail and slaughtered most of them. Governor John Penn issued bounties for the arrest of the murderers, but no one came forward to identify them. The Paxton Boys then set their sights on other Native Americans living within eastern Pennsylvania, many of whom fled to Philadelphia for protection. Several hundred Paxtonians marched on Philadelphia in January 1764, where the presence of British troops and Philadelphia militia prevented them from committing more violence. Benjamin Franklin, who had helped organize the local militia, negotiated with the Paxton leaders and brought an end to the immediate crisis. Franklin published a scathing indictment of the Paxton Boys. \\"If an Indian injures me,\\" he asked, \\"does it follow that I may revenge that Injury on all Indians?\\" One leader of the Paxton Boys was Lazarus Stewart who would be killed in the Wyoming Massacre of 1778.

Write an article with the title: \\"Two Essential Investing Tips\\" Article:","output":"Title: Two Essential Investing Tips Introduction Investing can be a daunting endeavor, especially for those new to the world of finance. However, mastering a few basic principles can significantly improve your chances of success. In this article, we will discuss two essential investing tips that everyone should keep in mind when entering the market. These tips will not only help you make well-informed decisions but also minimize potential risks. Tip 1: Diversify your investments One of the fundamental principles of investing is diversification. By spreading your investments across various asset classes, industries, and geographic locations, you can reduce the impact of a single poor-performing investment on your overall portfolio. Diversification helps to mitigate risks, while still providing the potential for healthy returns. Step-by-step process for diversifying your investments: 1. Analyze your risk tolerance: Your personal risk tolerance will dictate the degree of diversification you should pursue. A higher risk tolerance may allow you to invest in more volatile assets, while a lower risk tolerance should steer you towards more stable investments. 2. Choose a mix of asset classes: Diversification can be achieved by investing in different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities. Each asset class has its own risk and return characteristics, so carefully weigh their pros and cons before investing. 3. Invest in different industries: Within each asset class, consider investing in a variety of industries. For example, if you are investing in stocks, make sure your holdings are spread across technology, healthcare, energy, and other sectors. This practice helps protect your portfolio from industry-specific downturns. 4. Diversify geographically: Globalization has made it easier than ever to invest in markets around the world. By investing in both domestic and international stocks or funds, you can achieve geographical diversification, further spreading your risk. 5. Rebalance regularly: Market fluctuations can cause your asset allocation to shift over time. Periodically reviewing and rebalancing your portfolio helps ensure that it remains aligned with your risk tolerance and overall financial goals. Tip 2: Conduct thorough research Thorough research is vital for making informed and prudent investment decisions. Before diving into an investment opportunity, understand the underlying factors, industry trends, and historical performance of the asset or company. Step-by-step process for conducting investment research: 1. Assess the fundamentals: For individual stocks, analyze the company's financial health, profitability, and future growth prospects. Review key financial ratios, income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements to understand the company's strength and weaknesses. 2. Understand the industry: Assess the health and competitive landscape of the industry in which the investment opportunity exists. Look for emerging trends, factors influencing demand, and potential challenges or disruptions that could impact future performance. 3. Evaluate management: Investigate the track record of the company's management team. Determine if they have a history of success, proven strategies, and well-defined goals for the future. 4. Compare against peers: Compare the investment opportunity against its peers to see how it stacks up in terms of financial performance, growth potential, and overall competitiveness. 5. Monitor news and updates: Keep updated on any news or developments related to the investment, as these events can significantly affect its value. Conclusion To maximize your potential for success in investing, remember these two essential tips: diversify your investments and conduct thorough research before making any decisions. By adhering to these principles, you can better navigate the complex world of finance and make more informed choices, ultimately securing a brighter financial future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: You will always see someone rubbing the part of a statue corresponding to an afflicted area in the hope of relief from pain and worry. Hypothesis: People believe in rubbing the statue in order to help with the pain. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise states that people are always seen rubbing the part of a statue that corresponds to their own afflicted areas with the hopes of experiencing relief from pain and worry. This observation suggests that an underlying belief exists among these individuals who practice this behavior, which is the hypothesis – people believe in rubbing the statue in order to help with the pain. The premise and the hypothesis are connected because the actions of these people imply a belief in the healing or pain-relieving powers of rubbing the statue. The premise observes a pattern of behavior, and the hypothesis provides a possible explanation behind this behavior. It is essential to note, however, that the premise does not provide direct evidence that the belief in question is universally held by all; rather, it suggests that this belief is common enough among those who partake in the practice. To further explore this connection, let's consider why people might believe in rubbing the statue to help with their pain. Various cultures and religions often practice rituals or exhibit behaviors that are believed to have healing properties, provide relief, or even work as a form of protection. It is not uncommon for people to hold beliefs, based on their cultural, religious, or personal belief systems, that certain objects, places, or acts can positively influence their health and well-being. In the case of rubbing the part of a statue corresponding to an afflicted area, individuals may believe that the statue possesses certain properties or spiritual energies that can be transferred to their ailing body part through physical contact. This belief might be rooted in ancient cultural or religious practices that attribute healing power to certain symbols, objects, or locations. Moreover, the psychological aspect of belief also plays a crucial role in this practice. The placebo effect, in which a belief in the effectiveness of treatment leads to actual healing or relief despite the treatment itself having no direct impact, could also be at play here. People who genuinely believe that rubbing the statue will help with their pain may experience relief simply because their mind is convinced it will work. In conclusion, the premise, which is the observation of people rubbing statues in hopes of relief from pain and worry, entails the hypothesis that people believe in rubbing the statue in order to alleviate their pain.

Information:  - Conscription, or drafting, is the compulsory enlistment of people in a national service, most often a military service. Conscription dates back to antiquity and continues in some countries to the present day under various names. The modern system of near-universal national conscription for young men dates to the French Revolution in the 1790s, where it became the basis of a very large and powerful military.

In general, conscientious objector status is considered only in the context of military conscription and is not applicable to volunteer military forces.  - The Big Read was a survey on books carried out by the BBC in the United Kingdom in 2003, where over three quarters of a million votes were received from the British public to find the nation's best-loved novel of all time.

Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Lemonade makes money through the use of a stand.\\"?","output":"Based on the paragraph provided, it can be concluded that \\"Lemonade makes money through the use of a stand\\" is a valid interpretation, but it is important to expand and clarify this statement further. In the context of the paragraph, it is clear that the focus is on making money easily, specifically for kids, through hosting a lemonade stand. The concept of a lemonade stand involves setting up a small, temporary stall in a neighborhood or public area where children can sell lemonade. This activity is popular, particularly during the summer months, when people are more likely to crave a refreshing cold beverage. Lemonade stands can be a fun and educational way for children to make money. They provide an opportunity for kids to learn essential skills such as communication, salesmanship, basic math, and even marketing as they promote their stand. They also offer a way for children to engage in a simple business venture, make a profit, and contribute to their community. Getting some friends together to participate in the activity can make it more enjoyable and help share the responsibilities and workload. Friends can team up and collaborate on tasks like making lemonade, setting up the stand, advertising the sale, and serving customers. Working together can increase the chances of attracting more customers and, consequently, making more money. Given the information provided, it can be concluded that hosting a lemonade stand is a popular way for kids to make money by selling lemonade. While the initial statement is somewhat accurate, a more detailed phrasing might be, \\"Hosting a lemonade stand allows children to make money with the help of their friends by making and selling lemonade in their neighborhood during the summer months.\\" This encompasses the original idea while also providing more context and specificity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a premise: \\"the sun reflecting off of metal on a woman's purse.\\" Here is a hypothesis: \\"Light is being reflected.\\" .Does the premise tell us whether the hypothesis is true?","output":"Yes, the premise tells us that the hypothesis is true.  In the given premise, \\"the sun reflecting off of metal on a woman's purse,\\" we are presented with a description of a specific event involving light. This description shows the interaction between sunlight and the metal surface on the woman's purse. Understanding the nature of light and its behavior when it comes in contact with different surfaces can provide insight into how this premise supports the hypothesis. Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation that travels in waves. When light encounters a surface, it can be absorbed, transmitted, or reflected, depending on the properties of that surface. In this case, the surface in question is the metal on the purse. Metal surfaces are known for their tendency to reflect light. This is because metals have a high concentration of free electrons, which interact with the light waves and cause them to reflect off the surface rather than being absorbed or transmitted. With this knowledge, we can better understand the premise and its relation to the hypothesis. The sun, which is a source of light, shines on the metal surface of the woman's purse. The metal surface then reflects the light due to its aforementioned properties. This reflection of light is the main event described in the premise, and it is directly tied to the hypothesis: \\"Light is being reflected.\\" Hence, based on the understanding of light's behavior and the specific scenario described in the premise, we can safely conclude that the premise does indeed tell us that the hypothesis is true. The interaction between the sunlight and the metal surface on the purse results in the reflection of light, supporting the hypothesis that this event is taking place."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The renewed desire to share shows up in a variety of examples: A car-sharing service has had a 70 percent membership increase since the crisis occurred. Some companies encouraged his employees to take vanpooling. Governments are putting bikes on the street for public use. How-to-swap Web sites are increasing quickly. The economy reflects the way Americans have cut back, especially on daily items: Department store sales dropped 1.3 percent in June. People are not buying cars, and as a result, auto sales dropped 27.7 percent last month. They are not paying others to do what they can do themselves -- Home Depot reports increased attendance at in-store do-it-yourself clinics. And although paint sales are down in general, according to Sherwin-Williams, individual consumers are still buying. When Tom Burdett needed to cut some tiles at his home outside Annapolis, he refused to buy expensive tools. So he asked his neighbors and friends for help. Sure enough, someone had just what he needed. And when that friend needed help fixing a satellite dish, Burdett volunteered to help. The sharing mind-set is not new to the American culture, but many Americans give it up when the nation changed from an agricultural society to an industrial one, said Rosemary Hornak, a psychology professor at Meredith College in Raleigh, N.C. They moved farther from their families and did not have time to connect with new neighbors because they worked so much, she said. Neighborhood conversations tell more of the story as the movement grows organically   in communities across the Washington region and the nation. On one street in Arlington, for example, neighbors are collecting their separate money for mulch   and dividing it among themselves.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Like an acoustic guitar, an electric is basically just strings that vibrate over wood, but with the addition of all kinds of confusing-looking selector switches and knobs. Learning to identify the basic components of electric guitars can help demystify the process and help you focus on the most important parts.  Pick-ups will be placed under the strings near when the guitar is plucked. There may be as few as one pick-up and as many as three or four, depending on the guitar. These are used to pick up the sound of the guitar, which vibrates an internal magnetic coil, producing an electric signal that travels through the amplifier. Volume knobs will be included, sometimes as many as three. These allow you to adjust the output volume of the guitar. Tone knobs are used to toggle between the high and low frequencies in the pick-up. There are usually different tone knobs for each pick-up in the guitar. Selector or cut-off switches are used to select between the individual pick-ups and activate them, or cut them off. On most guitars you can use some combination of different pick-ups. The output jack is usually on the back-end of the guitar, or the bottom lip, where the guitar is plugged in to the amplifier via quarter-inch cable. To the untrained eye, all electric guitars might look basically the same, but body styles can be broken into several basic categories, each with its own subtleties of sound and playing style. Some body styles work better for certain genres, though there's no rule that says so. Lots of it has to do with your personal playing style and the music you want to make.  Solid body guitars are sturdy and weighty, made of a single piece of wood. Because there's no resonance chamber, solid-body guitars must be played through amplifiers. The variety of pick-ups and the electronics of a solid-body guitar are very important. These are the go-to guitars for rock 'n roll, punk, and metal music. Famous solid-body guitar styles include the Fender Stratocaster and the Gibson Les Paul. Hollow body electric guitars are, as the name suggests, hollow on the inside of the body. While there's no sound hole as will be found on an acoustic guitar, hollow-body electric guitars will often use a different variety of pick-up than a solid-body guitar. These are often used for playing jazz, featuring a warm and deep mid-range, and work best with mellow, low-volume amplifiers. Semi-hollow body electric guitars are hybrid models that feature a cut-out design and a small hollow portion of the body. These guitars have a bright and chime-like tone that's perfect for country music, folk-rock, and for lead-guitar work. The Rickenbacker and the Gibson ES are famous semi-hollow guitar models. Electric-acoustic guitars look basically like acoustic guitars, but feature pick-ups that allow them to be played like electric guitars. While these typically will have fewer features than other forms of electric guitars, electric-acoustics offer the versatility of playing them without the use of amplification. Primarily, the sound of a given electric guitar will come from the pick-up, though the pick-ups of a guitar can be changed out, customized, and upgraded. For a reason, it's important to give some consideration to the wood that the guitar is made from, but beginners will likely not notice a huge difference in sustain, so try not to be led down a garden-path by a salesman telling you that you have to upgrade to koa wood. Still, it's good to learn a bit about the different types of woods used to demystify the process. Most bodies are made of maple, mahogany, or poplar. Maple is known for its long sustain and bright character, while mahogany is known for its warmth. Poplar is great for bright and crispy high-register tone. Let's face it, the number one reason most people end up picking the guitar they pick is because it looks cooler than all the others. This is a perfectly legitimate reason to pick a guitar. Almost every guitar player who ever picked up an axe did so because they saw some other guitar player who looked awesome standing on stage.  Famous Gibson Les Paul pickers include Jimmy Page, Zakk Wilde, Slash, Randy Rhoads, and Bob Marley. Famous Fender Stratocaster players include Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Buddy Guy, and Stevie Ray Vaughn. Other iconic guitar models include the Gibson SG, played by Angus Young, the Fender Telecaster, played by Bruce Springsteen, the Gibson Flying V, played by Kirk Hammett, and the Fender Jazz Master, played by Kevin Shields, Elvis Costello, Thurston Moore, and J Mascis. Gearheads often fall into the same trap, thinking that super-expensive and obscure gear is also better than cheaper industry standard stuff. Sometimes, this is the case, but if you’re looking for a guitar to learn on, don't judge by the price. There are expensive guitars that have the resonance of a brick, and there are cheap guitars that really sing. Old Fenders that sell for thousands of dollars today started out life as inexpensive solid body guitars.  By the same token, if you're going to invest in a guitar to learn on, you need to get something that's worth playing. Toy guitars sold at places like Walmart aren't even worth the low price tags offered. It's better to go for a used guitar or a cheaper model of the guitar you want. Fender offers the \\"Squire\\" series, using somewhat cheaper materials, but the same designs as their other more expensive guitars. You can get a Squire Strat for around 300, compared with the 1400 it might cost for an American Stratocaster, if you're lucky. Explore used guitars and do your research to find deals. Some players will only play guitars that have been broken in a bit and worked over by other players. Neil Young is known for only playing old guitars, for example, and never plays new ones.","output":"The article provides a detailed overview of the different components and types of electric guitars, including their functioning, body styles, material used for construction, and their suitability for various music genres; it also offers advice on choosing a guitar, emphasizing not to base choices solely on the price, and includes information about famous guitar models and their renowned players."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Solve 4*a + 8 + 4 = 0 for a.","output":"To solve the equation 4*a + 8 + 4 = 0 for a, we will follow the necessary steps for solving a linear equation. Here's a step-by-step breakdown: 1. Combine like terms: The equation is given as 4*a + 8 + 4 = 0. In this equation, 8 and 4 are like terms because they are both constants. We can combine them by adding them together: 4*a + (8 + 4) = 0 4*a + 12 = 0 2. Isolate the variable term (a): Now we want to isolate the term with a to find its value. To achieve this, we can subtract 12 from both sides of the equation: 4*a + 12 - 12 = 0 - 12 4*a = -12 3. Solve for the variable (a): At this point, the equation is 4*a = -12. We need to get the value of a by itself. To accomplish this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4: (4*a) / 4 = -12 / 4 a = -3 So, the solution for the given equation 4*a + 8 + 4 = 0 is a = -3."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Title: Excellent Review: Ferry has researched his topic thoroughly, perhaps the only one worth lifelong investigation.

One day, while recounting old tales to his fellow Smurfs, Papa Smurf tells the story of the long-lost Flatbroke's Castle. Long ago, it was the home of a wealthy but humble king, who was beloved by his subjects. Legend has it that the castle hides a treasure trove of gold and precious gems the king left behind when he vanished mysteriously during a storm. No one knows the whereabouts of this extraordinary castle, as it has been erased from the maps and hidden from sight for centuries. However, Papa Smurf reveals an ancient scroll he had discovered in his youth, containing a cryptic clue leading to Flatbroke's Castle. Overhearing the fascinating tale, the curious and adventurous Smurfs – Hefty Smurf, Clumsy Smurf, Smurfette, and Brainy Smurf – decide to venture beyond the village to uncover the truth hidden in the legend. To help with their quest, Papa Smurf sends Johan and Peewit, two brave and trusted human friends, to accompany the determined Smurfs in their search. As a team, they set out on a thrilling journey through enchanted forests, treacherous mountain paths, and mysterious caves. During their mission, the group faces various challenges posed by the evil sorcerer Gargamel, who too learns about Flatbroke's Castle and its hidden riches. Gargamel relentlessly pursues the Smurfs, hoping to capture them and seize the treasure for his selfish desires. As the unlikely heroes traverse the magical lands, they forge friendships with woodland creatures, which aid them in deciphering the cryptic clues that lead them closer to the hidden castle. With wisdom and cooperation, the team is successful in outsmarting Gargamel and overcoming the obstacles he sets for them. Finally, after a long and treacherous journey, Johan, Peewit, and the Smurfs find the entrance to Flatbroke's Castle. It is a breathtaking sight – an enormous, magnificent castle hidden in plain sight by powerful, protective spells. Within its walls, they discover the king's treasure, along with the truth about the castle's hidden location: the king had chosen to keep it a secret to protect his people from the greed and chaos it might bring. Understanding the wisdom of the long-gone king, the group decides to leave the treasure undisturbed and preserve the secret of Flatbroke's Castle. In the process, they learn the value of teamwork, friendship, and the importance of protecting the greater good over personal desires.

Input: Context_1 : Captain Kidd (1645–1701) was a Scottish sailor who was tried and executed for piracy. Context_2 : The Indian Ocean Games Triangulaire was a triangulaire, or tournament between three teams, between Mauritius, Réunion, and Madagascar. It was the predecessor to the Indian Ocean Island Games. The triangulaire was held every year from 1947 until 1958, and then once more in 1963. In 1963, the last game, Mauritius vs Madagascar was abandoned in the 54th minute, which gave Madagascar the win that year. After that, Mauritius did not want to play Madagascar, and the tournament was not held. The Indian Ocean Island Games started in 1979 as a multi-sport event. In the football portion, Mauritius participated along with Réunion, Seychelles, Comoros, and the Maldives. Madagascar did not join until the second Indian Ocean Island Games, which was in Mauritius in 1985. The three triangulaire teams have been to every Indian Ocean Island Games since. Context_3 : Piracy in the Indian Ocean has been a threat to international shipping since the second phase of the Somali Civil War in the early 21st century. Since 2005, many international organizations have expressed concern over the rise in acts of piracy. Piracy impeded the delivery of shipments and increased shipping expenses, costing an estimated 6.6 to 6.9 billion a year in global trade according to Oceans Beyond Piracy (OBP). According to the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW), a veritable industry of profiteers also arose around the piracy. Insurance companies significantly increased their profits from the pirate attacks as insurance companies hiked premium rates in response. Context_4 : The 2011 North Indian Ocean cyclone season was the \\"least active\\" tropical cyclone season in the North Indian Ocean since 1993. Only two cyclone storms have formed throughout the year, far below the average of 4-6. The North Indian Ocean cyclone season has no official bounds, but cyclones tend to form between April and December, with peaks in May and November. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northern Indian Ocean. The scope of this article is limited to the Indian Ocean in the Northern Hemisphere, east of the Horn of Africa and west of the Malay Peninsula. There are two main seas in the North Indian Ocean — the Arabian Sea to the west of the Indian subcontinent, abbreviated \\"ARB\\" by the India Meteorological Department (IMD); and the Bay of Bengal to the east, abbreviated \\"BOB\\" by the IMD. Context_5 : William Kidd, also \\"Captain William Kidd\\" or simply \\"Captain Kidd\\" (c.1654 – 23 May 1701) was a Scottish sailor who was tried and executed for piracy after returning from a voyage to the Indian Ocean. Some modern historians deem his piratical reputation unjust. Context_6 : Very Intense Tropical Cyclone Fantala was the most intense tropical cyclone of the south-west Indian Ocean in terms of sustained winds. Part of the 2015–16 cyclone season, Fantala formed on 11 April to the south of Diego Garcia, an island in the central Indian Ocean. With a ridge to the south, the storm moved westward for several days while gaining strength, aided by warm waters and decreasing wind shear. Late on 17 April, the Météo-France office on Réunion (MFR) estimated peak 10-minute winds of 250 km/h (155 mph), making Fantala the strongest tropical cyclone of the basin in terms of 10-minute sustained winds. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) estimated peak 1-minute winds of 285 km/h (180 mph), equivalent to Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale and the strongest on record in the south-west Indian Ocean. Context_7 : William Burke (d. 1699, first name occasionally Thomas, last name occasionally Burk, Burt, Bourck, Burch, or Burcke) was an Irish pirate and trader active in the Caribbean and near Newfoundland, best known for aiding William Kidd. Context_8 : John H. Blair (born 1887) was a Scottish sailor. During his early career, he worked aboard the Loch Line, which operated between Britain and Australia. He then joined a Melbourne shipping company, and worked the Australia-India trade. From 1913–14, Blair served as Chief Officer aboard the SY \\"Aurora\\", under John King Davis, during the final Antarctic voyage of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition (AAE). He later became Chief Executive Officer of Pangbourne Nautical College. Context_9 : Indian Ocean is the debut album from Indian Ocean. The band’s first album, recorded in just 10 days at HMV’s Dumdum studio, Calcutta, in December 1992. Shaleen Sharma played the drums on this album. This is the only album in which Shaleen Sharma was present; later when Shaleen Sharma left the band he was replaced by Amit Kilam. Released on cassette initially and later on CD. This was a purely instrumental album with only a line or two sung by Asheem. It was a fluid album and defined the true sound of Indian Ocean before they became more of a pop band. A total of 30,000 copies were sold, but it has the potential for a release and perhaps an LP version for a justice to be done to the crisp sound. Recording engineer for this album was Raja Mukherjee. Cover concept was done by Manas Chakrabarti. The graphic design work was done by Navin Shiromani. The Durgapal family gave \\"Indian Ocean\\" all their time, patience and space while Indian Ocean prepared for this recording. Context_10 : James Gilliam, also known as James Kelly, (died July 12, 1701) was an English pirate active in the Indian Ocean during the 1690s and was a longtime associate of Captain William Kidd. Prior to his association with Kidd, he sailed with George Raynor and Edward Davis aboard the \\"Batchelor's Delight.\\" One of Kidd's earliest crew members, Gilliam was a participant in the mutiny on board the \\"Mocha\\" and the subsequent murder of Captain Edgecomb who was killed in his sleep. After taking command of the East Indiaman, Gilliam and the \\"Mocha\\", under successive Captains Ralph Stout and Robert Culliford, assisted in the capture of several ships in the Indian Ocean. Gilliam was arrested after returning to New England with Kidd in 1699. Transported to Great Britain, he was tried at the Old Bailey and found guilty of piracy. While in prison, he wrote \\"A full and true Discovery of all the Robberies, Pyracies, and other Notorious Actions, of that Famous English Pyrate, Capt. James Kelly\\" which included references to the as yet undiscovered Galapagos Islands before his eventual execution on July 12, 1701. fact_1 : William Burke (d. 1699, first name occasionally Thomas, last name occasionally Burk, Burt, Bourck, Burch, or Burcke) was an Irish pirate and trader active in the Caribbean and near Newfoundland, best known for aiding William Kidd. fact_2 : William Kidd, also \\"Captain William Kidd\\" or simply \\"Captain Kidd\\" (c.1654 – 23 May 1701) was a Scottish sailor who was tried and executed for piracy after returning from a voyage to the Indian Ocean.

This article: Dissatisfied with his first large-scale orchestral work, the D major Overture of 1848, Smetana studied passages from Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Weber and Berlioz before producing his Triumphal Symphony of 1853. Though this is dismissed by Rosa Newmarch as \\"an epithalamium for a Habsburg Prince\\", Smetana's biographer Brian Large identifies much in the piece that characterises the composer's more mature works. Despite the symphony's rejection by the Court and the lukewarm reception on its premiere, Smetana did not abandon the work. It was well received in Gothenburg in 1860, and a revised version was performed in Prague in 1882, without the \\"triumphal\\" tag, under Adolf Čech. The piece is now sometimes called the Festive Symphony. Smetana's visit to Liszt at Weimar in the summer of 1857, where he heard the latter's Faust Symphony and Die Ideale, caused a material reorientation of Smetana's orchestral music. These works gave Smetana answers to many compositional problems relating to the structure of orchestral music, and suggested a means for expressing literary subjects by a synthesis between music and text, rather than by simple musical illustration. These insights enabled Smetana to write the three Gothenburg symphonic poems, (Richard III, Wallenstein's Camp and Hakon Jarl), works that transformed Smetana from a composer primarily of salon pieces to a modern neo-Romantic, capable of handling large-scale forces and demonstrating the latest musical concepts. From 1862 Smetana was largely occupied with opera and, apart from a few short pieces, did not return to purely orchestral music before beginning Má vlast in 1872. In his introduction to the Collected Edition Score, František Bartol brackets Má vlast with the opera Libuše as \\"direct symbols of [the] consummating national struggle\\". Má vlast is the first of Smetana's mature large-scale works that is independent of words, and its musical ideas are bolder than anything he had tried before. To musicologist John Clapham, the cycle presents \\"a cross-section of Czech... contains an answer for the question: What is the name of Smetana's first large-scale piece that is independent of words?, what is it ? A:","output":"Má vlast is the name of Smetana's first large-scale piece that is independent of words. This work is a cycle of six symphonic poems, and it is considered a significant representation of Czech national music. Its musical ideas are bolder than anything Smetana had tried before, and it symbolizes the consummation of the national struggle of the time. Má vlast is a reflection of Smetana's growth as a composer, showcasing his ability to handle large-scale forces and demonstrate the latest musical concepts in a neo-Romantic style."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Single/multi-choice problem: Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: Fix cracks in floor. Choices:  (1). Fill in cracks with pen ink.  (2). Melt same colored crayon and fill in cracks.","output":"When attempting to fix cracks in a floor, it is important to consider the efficacy, durability, and aesthetic factors of the solution. In this case, both (1) filling in the cracks with pen ink and (2) melting a same-colored crayon and filling in the cracks are unconventional options. However, among the two choices provided, Option (2) - Melt the same colored crayon and fill in cracks - is the better solution for the following reasons: 1. Pen ink is generally thin and will not provide adequate filling for any floor cracks. The ink is likely to seep into porous surfaces such as concrete or grout, leading to uneven coverage and further staining the surrounding area. Additionally, pen ink can easily smear and spread, creating an aesthetically displeasing appearance and potentially staining the floor further. 2. Crayon wax, on the other hand, offers a more stable, semi-solid filling material when melted, which makes it better suited for filling in cracks. The wax will harden as it cools down, creating a relatively smooth surface that is more durable and longer-lasting than pen ink. 3. The use of same-colored crayon allows for a better match of the floor's color, ensuring a more consistent and visually appealing result. This color matching advantage is crucial in maintaining the aesthetics of the floor. Pen ink, typically available in a limited range of colors, is unlikely to blend well with the floor color, resulting in an apparent repair that may actually draw more attention to the crack. 4. Using melted crayon wax offers some degree of flexibility when repairing the crack. If the initial application does not yield the desired result, the crayon wax can be reheated and re-melted to create a smoother and more even finish. This makes it easier to achieve a satisfactory appearance. Despite Option (2) being comparatively better, it is important to note that neither alternative is a professional or ideal solution for fixing cracks in a floor.  Consulting with a professional or using specialized crack repair materials (e.g., epoxy, concrete patch, or wood filler) would be recommended for a more effective and longer-lasting repair, especially in cases where the cracks might be indicative of severe structural problems. Such specialized materials are designed to properly bond to surfaces and provide greater durability, ensuring the repaired area remains protected and blends seamlessly with the surrounding floor."},{"instruction":"Definition: You are given a sentence in English.

Article:Media playback is not supported on this device McDermott, 51, led the club to promotion last season, but four successive Premier League defeats have left them four points adrift of safety. A Reading statement said: \\"The search for a successor starts immediately. It is hoped a new manager will be in place as soon as possible.\\" Media playback is not supported on this device Academy head Eamonn Dolan is in charge of the first team in the interim. The Royals also confirmed first-team coach Nigel Gibbs had also left the club he joined in 2006. McDermott joined Reading in 2000 as a scout/coach working under Alan Pardew and Steve Coppell. He was named caretaker manager in 2009 following the sacking of Brendan Rodgers, before being appointed permanent manager. McDermott just missed out on promotion to the Premier League in his first season in charge of Reading, reaching the play-off final but losing 4-2 to Swansea City. However, a run of 15 wins from 19 games towards the end of last season secured the Championship title and the Royals' promotion to the top flight for only the second time in the club's history. In May 2012, Reading were taken over by Russian tycoon Anton Zingarevich, who acquired 51% of the club, and also announced a reshuffle in the boardroom. \\"I'm just hoping Reading don't end up in a similar situation Wolves find themselves. They sacked their manager before the end of last season, had an interim manager and this season they are near the bottom of the Championship. \\"It's a big decision for the new owner to make and it will be an even bigger decision replacing him.\\" Reading struggled for the first half of this season, winning only two Premier League games, but they showed signs of improvement in 2013 with four successive victories in all competitions, including two in the top flight, and McDermott was named the January manager of the month. However, defeats by Stoke, Wigan and Everton, followed before a 2-1 loss at home to relegation rivals Aston Villa at the weekend, left Reading 19th in the table, level on 23 points with bottom club QPR. Dropping out of the Premier League would mean the club would miss out on a share of a new TV deal worth about £5bn across three years from August. The Reading statement added: \\"[Reading] owner Anton Zingarevich wishes to place on record his thanks to Brian who had achieved great success with the club since taking over as Manager in December 2009. \\"Brian gained promotion to the Premier League last year for only the second time in the club's history thanks to a remarkable run at the end of last season. \\"However, in our current situation, owner Anton Zingarevich felt that a change was necessary.\\" Reacting to the news, Reading striker Noel Hunt wrote on Twitter: \\"Want to say thanks to Brian for everything he did for me especially.

McDermott, who joined Reading in 2000 as a scout/coach, had led the club to enjoy the Championship title and promotion to the top-tier league in the previous season, an achievement that marked only the second instance in the club's history. Despite the success of the past, Reading struggled in the first half of the current season, securing only two Premier League wins initially. However, some improvement was noticed in 2013 when the team logged four successive victories in all competitions and McDermott was named January's manager of the month. Unfortunately for the club and McDermott, subsequent defeats led to a drop in league standing that threatened Reading's share in a lucrative TV deal worth about £5 billion over three years. In the wake of McDermott’s departure, the academy head Eamonn Dolan took over the first team on an interim basis, and the club began the search for a new manager. The move came at a crucial time as the Reading team was struggling with their place in the league and also facing potential financial consequences. The club’s first-team coach, Nigel Gibbs, has also left the club. The owner of Reading, Anton Zingarevich, expressed thanks to McDermott for his service since taking over as manager in 2009 and for the feats he accomplished with the club. However, given the current predicament of the club, Zingarevich felt a change was necessary. Many of the players expressed their shock and sadness over McDermott's departure. Reading striker Noel Hunt thanked him for his contribution, and former Reading captain Aidy Williams expressed surprise at both the timing and the event. Jason Roberts, a current Reading player and BBC Radio 5 live pundit, acknowledged McDermott's dedication and the significant achievements made under his leadership, while commenting on the necessity to now rally behind the new manager and focus on staying in the Premier League."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(AP Photo/Paul Sancya) We caught up with Baier to discuss how this event came together, what he plans to ask and if he thinks anti-Donald Trump Republicans would vote for Clinton in the general election. TheWrap: How did Fox News get Hillary Clinton to agree to this? Baier: We've been working for a while. I had invited Secretary Clinton to this town hall originally. Sen. Sanders did agree a couple of weeks ago and confirmed, but we were told originally Clinton had a scheduling conflict and it wasn't going to happen. We had Thursday night's debate in Detroit, and then Friday got word that the Clinton camp wanted to see if it was still possible to happen, and they had reconsidered. Right before my show at 6 p.m., we got confirmation that she would take part. I don't know what was the impetus for the change, but we're very happy that she's here, and to have both Democratic candidates in the town hall on the No. 1 cable news station is great. Sanders and Clinton had a debate last night in Flint. What still needs to be answered before tomorrow's Michigan primary? First of all, there are a couple of things in those exchanges last night that we could potentially follow up on. There are topics that have not been talked about or discussed on the Democratic side as of yet. Hopefully we'll get to some of those. I'll ask a few questions and then we have 300 Michiganders, mostly undecided Democratic voters, but there are a few who are independent and actually deciding between Trump and Sanders. There are a couple deciding between Rubio and Clinton. This is an open primary in Michigan, so we have an out of great questions that have not been asked yet. Also Read: Surprise: Clinton Joins Sanders in Call For Michigan Governor's Resignation -- After Her Camp Said She Wouldn't Will you question Clinton about calling for Michigan's Gov. Rick Snyder to resign during last night's debate, after her spokesperson said she wouldn't do that during the pre-debate coverage? [Laughs] Maybe. I don't want to reveal too many of the questions ahead of time but I think there are things to follow up on from last night. Also Read: Why the GOP Perception of Fox News Doesn't Impact Viewership Do you think Clinton will use an appearance on Fox News to appeal to anti-Trump members of the GOP as she looks forward to the general election? I don't know. You'd have to ask the Clinton campaign of the calculation. I will say that there are an amazing amount of Independents and Democrats and Republicans who watch Fox, if you look at all the breakdowns as of late of our viewership. One would think that any campaign would want to hit the biggest audience in cable news. And as you get closer to the general election, I assume that factors into the equation.

Solve this instance: Context: Sequential events of endometrial tumorigenesis can be studied by comparison of genetic lesions seen in normal, premalignant, and malignant tissues. The distribution of k-ras mutations in microsatellite stable and unstable premalignant lesions was studied to determine whether this gene is implicated in both tumorigenic pathways.', 'K-ras mutations were analysed by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and direct sequencing in matched endometrial normal, premalignant (atypical hyperplasias), and adenocarcinoma tissues from individual patients. Identification of precancers solely by their appearance as atypical endometrial hyperplasias is very subjective; therefore, in addition to histopathological assessment, we performed molecular testing (non-random X inactivation or clonal altered microsatellites) for an expected feature of precancers--that is, monoclonality.', 'Equivalent K-ras mutation frequencies were seen in microsatellite stable (six of 33) and unstable (three of 23) cancers. In both types, K-ras mutation in monoclonal precancers usually corresponded to a change from normal to an equivocal (two of 12) or hyperplastic (10 of 12) histology. Divergent K-ras genotypes among multiple neoplastic tissues of individual patients (two of six patients) are exceptions explained either by multicentric premalignant disease, or acquisition of K-ras mutation late in neoplastic progression.Question: Do k-ras mutations appear in the premalignant phase of both microsatellite stable and unstable endometrial carcinogenesis? Student:","output":"Yes, k-ras mutations appear in the premalignant phase of both microsatellite stable and unstable endometrial carcinogenesis. In the context provided, it is mentioned that equivalent K-ras mutation frequencies were seen in microsatellite stable (six of 33) and unstable (three of 23) cancers. Additionally, in both types of lesions, K-ras mutation in monoclonal precancers usually corresponded to a change from normal to an equivocal (two of 12) or hyperplastic (10 of 12) histology.

Options: - city - shoes - apartment building - town - london The answer is:","output":"Apartment building. In order to find a very nice flat, the most suitable option among the given choices would be an apartment building. Apartment buildings are specifically designed to house multiple residential units, which often include flats as one of the available living spaces. When searching for a nice flat, an apartment building presents several advantages. Firstly, these buildings typically offer a variety of flat sizes and floor plans, catering to a wide range of tastes and preferences. This variety allows potential renters or buyers to choose a flat that best suits their specific needs and requirements. Secondly, apartment buildings usually come with certain amenities that may not be available in standalone houses or flats in quieter residential areas. Such amenities may include gyms, swimming pools, laundry facilities, and in some cases, even shopping centers or cafes on the premises. These conveniences not only enhance the living experience of the residents, but they also contribute to the overall appeal of the flat. Thirdly, apartment buildings are oftentimes located in prime locations within cities or towns, providing easy access to public transportation, job opportunities, schools, restaurants, and entertainment venues. This strategic positioning adds a layer of convenience for the residents, as it reduces the time spent on daily commuting and offers a more vibrant and connected lifestyle. It is important to note that while apartment buildings are the most suitable option to find a nice flat among the given choices, there are other factors to consider when searching for a perfect living space. For instance, the desired neighborhood, budget constraints, and personal preferences will all play a crucial role in determining the ideal flat. Although some other options like cities, towns, and London might also be potential places to find nice flats, these choices represent broader geographic locations rather than a specific type of housing. Consequently, opting for an apartment building narrows down the search to a more specific setting, where the probability of finding a superb flat is substantially higher. In summary, an apartment building is the most suitable option for finding a very nice flat, given its unique advantages such as a wide variety of floor plans, access to amenities, desirable locations, and higher likelihood of meeting specific living requirements compared to other options."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It was unusual for people to travel by air because it was expensive and dangerous. In those days, there were no flight attendants to look after the passengers. Young men ,or \\"stewards\\" helped the passengers onto the airplane and carried the passengers' luggage but they did not provide food and drinks. _  Ellen Church was born in 1904 on a farm in Iowa. She was a different child. She didn't want to work on a farm or marry a farmer --she wanted a more adventurous life. Ellen studied to be a nurse at the University of Minnesota and then got a job in a hospital. For the next few years she stayed at the hospital but also took flying lessons and got her pilot's license. Ellen was twenty-five years old when she first got in touch with Boeing Air Transport. She loved flying but she understood that airlines were a man's world. Although women like Emelia Earheart were becoming famous, she realized it was impossible for a woman to have a career as a pilot .But she had another idea. Most people were frightened of flying because. flying was still an unreliable  way to travel. There were often delays ,many crashes and the bad weathers made many passengers sick. Ellen thought nurses could take care of passengers during flights and B.A.T. agreed. The young woman from Iowa and seven other nurses became the first air stewardesses. At first pilots were unhappy because they did not want stewardesses on airplanes, but passengers loved the stewardesses. In 1940 there were around 1000 of them working for different airlines. The early \\"stewardesses\\" had to be under twenty-five-year-old, single and slim. When a woman joined an airline, she had to promise not to get married or have children. It was hard job and not well paid. They worked long hours and earned 1 an hour. In the 1970s, stewardesses were unhappy in their job and airlines had to make some changes. Since the 1970s, \\"stewardesses\\" have been called flight attendants. They are well paid and work fewer hours than in the past.

Translate to Finnish","output":"Ajatelkaa vain Euroopan neuvoston yrityksiä poistaa asetuontikieltoa Kiinaa vastaan tai sitä tapaa, jolla Euroopan kauppavaltuuskunnat ovat toistensa tiellä Kiinassa nykyään. Euroopan neuvosto on pyrkinyt aktiivisesti kumoamaan nykyisen asetuontikiellon, joka on ollut voimassa Kiinaa vastaan vuodesta 1989 lähtien. Tämä kielto asetettiin alun perin vastauksena Tiibetin mielenosoitusten väkivaltaiseen tukahduttamiseen sekä Tiananmenin aukion verilöylyyn. Euroopan neuvosto on pitänyt tämän asetuontikiellon yllä erilaisilla perusteilla, kuten huoli ihmisoikeuksista ja alueen vakauden turvaamisesta. Miksi Euroopan neuvosto on sitten kiinnostunut muuttamaan nykytilannetta? Yksi keskeinen tekijä on taloudellinen etu. Euroopan unionilla on runsaasti asetuotantokapasiteettia, ja se toivoo pääsevänsä vahvemmin mukaan Kiinan kasvavaan ja potentiaaliseen asekauppamarkkinaan, joka on maailman toiseksi suurin. Samalla tämä voimaantullut asevienti voi avata ovet uusille teknologia- ja teollisuusyhteistyömahdollisuuksille. Toinen tekijä on se, että Euroopan unioni haluaa tämän avulla tiivistää diplomaattisia ja poliittisia suhteitaan Kiinaan, joka on yksi maailman suurimmista talouksista, sen kasvavan vaikutusvallan vuoksi kansainvälisellä areenalla. Kiina on myös yksi Euroopan unionin tärkeimmistä kauppakumppaneista ja investoinnin houkutteleva kohde. Kuitenkin tämä lähestymistapa ei ole herättänyt innostusta kaikkien jäsenmaiden keskuudessa. Itse asiassa monet Euroopan maat kilpailevat keskenään Kiinan markkinoille pääsystä, usein tarjoamalla erilaisia ehtoja ja sopimuksia. Tämä on johtanut Euroopan kauppavaltuuskuntien välisten ristiriitojen syntyyn, jossain määrin hankaloittaen yhteistyötä ja yhtenäisen lähestymistavan luomista. Yhteenvetona voidaan todeta, että Euroopan neuvoston pyrkimykset kumota asetuontikielto Kiinaa vastaan ja Euroopan kauppavaltuuskuntien välinen kilpailu Kiinan markkinoilla ovat herättäneet paljon keskustelua ja erimielisyyksiä.

Write an article based on this summary: At least 24 people in 13 countries have been arrested in a US-led sting operation targeting illegal trafficking of credit card information.","output":"Title: International Crackdown on Credit Card Trafficking Brings 24 Arrests across 13 Countries Introduction In a major coordinated effort to tackle the ever-growing problem of credit card information theft and trafficking, at least 24 individuals across 13 countries have been detained in a US-led sting operation. This large-scale crackdown shows the continued push by law enforcement and governments to protect consumers and businesses from the devastating effects of cybercrime and fraud. In this article, we delve into the details of this recent operation and explore the implications for the ongoing fight against digital criminal activities. The Operation The operation was a result of close collaboration by law enforcement agencies in 13 countries, with the United States at the helm. Agencies involved in the sting operation included the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Europol, and various police departments from countries such as Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. The primary aim of the operation was to target those engaged in the illegal trafficking of stolen credit card information, a crime that has seen a sharp uptick in recent years due to the increasing reliance on digital payment methods. During the course of the investigation, law enforcement officials were able to identify and apprehend suspects involved in the unauthorized access and sale of financial data, leading to the arrest of 24 individuals across multiple continents. Over the course of the operation, officers not only arrested individuals but also undertook an extensive search and seizure of electronic devices and equipment used in conducting these nefarious activities. Furthermore, the coordinated efforts of law enforcement also led to the identification and mitigation of numerous digital forums and dark web sites, used by the criminals to exchange stolen financial data, effectively disrupting a significant portion of this illegal trade. Challenges and Results One of the primary challenges the operation faced was the growing use of the dark web and encryption technologies by criminals for the purpose of hiding their digital footprints. The suspects used these advanced tools to engage in their illicit activities, making it increasingly difficult for law enforcement to track, monitor, and gather evidence. Despite these challenges, the operation has demonstrated the potential for international collaboration in the war against cybercrime, reinforcing the importance of sharing information and resources to detect and prosecute those responsible. The 24 arrests have caused a significant dent in the illegal trafficking of credit card information, and raise awareness of the strides being made by the global law enforcement community to eliminate such financial crimes. The Future of Combating Credit Card Trafficking As cybercrime continues to evolve and grow in complexity, so too must the efforts to combat it. The recent US-led operation sends a powerful message to criminals engaged in credit card information theft and serves as a stark reminder that law enforcement agencies worldwide are honing their skills and enhancing their capabilities to counter these digital threats. This crackdown is just one example of the ongoing battle against cross-border cybercrime and reinforces the importance of international cooperation and intelligence sharing among various countries. It is clear that by combining their efforts, law enforcement agencies can achieve better results in addressing and dismantling these sophisticated criminal networks. Conclusion The international operation that led to 24 arrests across 13 countries marks a significant victory in the fight against illegal trafficking of credit card information. However, this success should not be viewed as the end of the struggle—instead, it should be considered as a stepping stone towards further collaboration and innovation in the battle against cybercrime. As technology advances and criminal networks become increasingly sophisticated, law enforcement must continue to adapt and improve its strategies and tactics, working together in a united effort to protect and serve the global community against the scourge of credit card theft and fraud."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If \\"Two smiling children in bathing suits jumping in a tidal pool at the beach.\\", does it logically follow that \\"A couple of humans near water.\\"?","output":"Yes, the statement \\"Two smiling children in bathing suits jumping in a tidal pool at the beach\\" logically supports the premise that \\"A couple of humans near water.\\"  To further elaborate, let's break down the statement: 1. Two smiling children: This clearly defines that there are two human beings who are children, and they are expressing happiness through their smiles. 2. In bathing suits: This piece of information tells us that the children are dressed appropriately for an activity involving water (such as swimming or playing), suggesting they are in close proximity to a body of water. 3. Jumping in a tidal pool: This part of the statement confirms that the children are interacting with a body of water, which in this case is a tidal pool. A tidal pool is a pool of seawater that is near the beach and is usually found along rocky coastlines where water is collected during high tide. 4. At the beach: This information reveals the location and establishes that the humans are next to a larger body of water (usually the ocean or the sea). With this information, we can infer that the original statement implies the presence of \\"a couple of humans,\\" in this case, two children, who are indeed \\"near water,\\" since they are engaged in an activity at a tidal pool on the beach. The use of the term \\"couple\\" also signifies the presence of two individuals, which aligns with the count of children in the original statement."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: The bodies were found in three vehicles that were crushed by fallen concrete panels in the Sasago tunnel, about 80km (50 miles) west of the capital Tokyo. A fire broke out after the tunnel caved in on Sunday, and a number of survivors fled to safety on foot. The usually busy tunnel remains closed, as police are investigating potential negligence. There will be serious questions about how a major tunnel on one of Japan's most important traffic arteries could have failed so catastrophically, the BBC's Rupert Wingfield Hayes in Tokyo reports. The private company that runs the highway has said the tunnel was given a major inspection just two months ago and was given a clean bill of health, our correspondent adds. In pictures: Japan tunnel collapse Emergency workers said that five bodies were recovered from a van early on Monday. They were identified as three men and two women, all in their twenties and from Tokyo, Kyodo news agency reported. Another woman, aged 28, who had been in the vehicle survived. Three bodies were found in a car and another body in a lorry. The driver of the lorry had reportedly telephoned for help from inside the 4.3km (2.7 miles) twin-bore tunnel - one of the longest in Japan. Part of the tunnel collapsed at 08:00 local time (23:00 GMT Saturday). Thick black smoke was seen billowing from the tunnel, hampering rescue efforts. Pictures from closed circuit TV cameras inside the tunnel later showed a section of up to 100m (328ft) that had caved in on the Tokyo-bound lanes on the Chuo Expressway in Yamanashi prefecture. A reporter for public broadcaster NHK described driving through the tunnel as it began to collapse, seeing other cars trapped and on fire. His car was badly damaged, he said. Another survivor told the broadcaster that he saw \\"a concrete part of the ceiling fall off all of a sudden when I was driving inside. I saw a fire coming from a crushed car\\". Survivor Tomohiro Suzuki said: \\"A part of the ceiling, just as wide as the road, had collapsed straight down and broken in the middle into a V-shape.\\" He and his family walked for an hour to get out, with the smoke worsening. \\"I heard after a while on the public address system that a fire had occurred inside the tunnel and the sprinkler system was going to be activated,\\" he told Jiji Press. \\"I kept wondering when the fire would spread and catch us,\\" Mr Suzuki said. Japan is prone to large earthquakes, but none was reported in the area at the time. Some experts have said that structural failure may be to blame - but this has not been confirmed by the authorities. Summary:","output":"There was a big tunnel in Japan called the Sasago tunnel. One day, some parts of the tunnel fell down and crushed 3 vehicles. People found 9 people who couldn't make it out, but some others were able to run to safety.

Please answer the following question: I was a waitress at the New England regional chain Newport Creamery for seven years in Jr. High, High School, and College. In college, I needed money for school supplies, so in addition to slinging ice cream cones and “Awful Awfuls” at the Creamery, I picked up a few more jobs: working the dinner shift at a family restaurant, heaving trays of cocktails at a bar until 3AM, and cleaning houses. Needless to say, I was a wreck, and a big time abuser of coffee and cigarettes. One day just before my shift at the Creamery began, I slung back a huge coffee and hauled on a Newport cigarette in the kitchen (this was when you could do things like smoke in a restaurant kitchen.) I then went out to the dining floor and approached my first table, who had been given menus and was waiting for me to take their order. “Hi, How are you today?”, I cheerfully asked the mother and her three daughters, all looking under 12. “What may I get you?…..” Then, fade to black as a huge swooshing sound took over my head. Next thing I know, I’m on the floor, covered in blood, the girls are screaming blue murder, and my manager is shaking like a leaf as he coddles me. Apparently, I passed out right onto the table of the nice family I was waiting on, then fell back and whacked my head on the corner of a wall. I remember noticing that my kelly green polyester dress was an awful shade of bloodied brown. My main concern was that I had a hot date that night, and now I had to go to the emergency room!

The leader of the independence faction is the abrasive John Adams of Massachusetts, whose continuous pushing of the issue has brought their cause to a complete standstill. John Dickinson of Pennsylvania leads the opposition that hopes for reconciliation with England. During his quieter moments, Adams calls up the image of his wife Abigail Adams, who resides in Massachusetts and gives him insight and encouragement (these conversations are based on letters between the couple). Dr. Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania suggests another colony that supports independence should submit a proposal. Richard Henry Lee of Virginia voluntarily rides off to Williamsburg, Virginia to get authorization from the Virginia Colony to propose independence. Dr. Lyman Hall arrives to represent Georgia, and immediately, he is interrogated by his fellow delegates regarding his views on independence (with Dickinson framing it as \\"treason\\").

I have something to tell. We have record rainfall during 24 hours in Lahore, breaking previous one day record by more than 60%. Our drainage system is pathetic. Other systems such as telephone, electricity, cable etc. are no better. Poor planning has further been aggravated by extremely mismanaged maintenance and operational bugs. This morning, when I was out for our fajr (morning prayers) in masjid, a neighbor told me that the pole laden with electricity meters was under fire. After that he buzzed off for complaint office. When I returned after prayers, I saw fire reaching cable part after meter; one meter had caught fire and other meters (including ours) was in danger of catching fire. It was still dark. I waited for someone to come out. No one appeared. I came inside and told my wife about and went again out to see if I could find someone to go about extinguishing fire. IT WAS DAM RISKY AS DIGGING WAS DONE BY TELEPHONE COMPANY AND RAINS HAD MADE A MESS ON OUR STREET. No one was seen. My wife came out; brought hose pipe. I managed to use it as water gun and there was some post-extinguishing sparking; fire was put out. I want to add here that hose pipe should only be used when someone knows how to send bursts of water so that electric current cannot build a circuit. Later in day we heard about the most stupid thing; people were inside their houses, watching flames from pole but not knowing what to do. THEY DID NOT EVEN COME OUT TO SHARE THE ACTIVITY. That has happened today. I am going to ask everyone about it one by one. Also, I am still looking for the guy who went to complaint office and was never seen thereafter this morning. That can happen to anybody. Question: After the end of this story, how was the narrator probably feeling?

There are two options provided:   - shelf had been been attention.   - drawer had been been attention. Both options have a repetition of the word \\"been,\\" which is likely a typo and should be removed. The main difference between the options is whether the shelf or the drawer received attention. Step 3: Choose the appropriate option based on the context. Since the sentence begins by stating that the drawer was more organized than the shelf, it makes sense to choose the option that says the drawer had been given attention. That is because giving attention to organizing the drawer would lead it to be more organized. In contrast, if the shelf had received attention, the shelf would likely be more organized instead.

Given the below context:  Alan Dudley Bush (22 December 1900 – 31 October 1995) was a British composer, pianist, conductor, teacher and political activist. A committed communist, his uncompromising political beliefs were often reflected in his music. He composed prolifically across a range of genres, but struggled through his lifetime for recognition from the British musical establishment, which largely ignored his works. Bush, from a prosperous middle-class background, enjoyed considerable success as a student at the Royal Academy of Music (RAM) in the early 1920s, and spent much of that decade furthering his compositional and piano-playing skills under distinguished tutors. A two-year period in Berlin in 1929 to 1931, early in the Nazi Party's rise to power, cemented Bush's political convictions and moved him from the mainstream Labour Party to the Communist Party of Great Britain which he joined in 1935. He wrote several large-scale works in the 1930s, and was heavily involved with workers' choirs for whom he composed pageants, choruses and songs. His pro-Soviet stance led to a temporary ban on his music by the BBC in the early years of the Second World War, and his refusal to modify his position in the postwar Cold War era led to a more prolonged semi-ostracism of his music. As  a result, the four major operas he wrote between 1950 and 1970 were all premiered in East Germany. In his prewar works, Bush's style retained what commentators have described as an essential Englishness, but was also influenced by the avant-garde European idioms of the inter-war years. During and after the war he began to simplify this style, in line with his Marxism-inspired belief that music should be accessible to the mass of the people. Despite the difficulties he encountered in getting his works performed in the West he continued to compose until well into his eighties. He taught composition at the RAM for more than 50 years, published two books, was the founder and long-time president of the Workers' Music Association, and served as chairman and...

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What are the first names of the four members of Germs?  Jan Paul Beahm grows up in Los Angeles through a troubled childhood; he does not know his biological father, his mother is an alcoholic, and his older brother dies from a heroin overdose. He is an avid reader and develops into a \\"frighteningly intelligent\\" student at University High School, where his antisocial behavior leads the administration to give him straight A's if he agrees not to return. In December 1975, at age 17, he proposes to his friend Georg Ruthenberg that they start a band, showing him potential lyrics and claiming to have a \\"five-year plan\\" inspired by the David Bowie song \\"Five Years\\". They recruit Terri Ryan, Belinda Carlisle, and Becky Barton for the group and con money for instruments. Jan Paul comes up with the name Germs, representing the germination of an idea. He sings while Georg plays guitar, Terri plays bass guitar, and Becky plays drums. The Germs play their first gig on April 16, 1977. As they are heckling the Damned outside the Whisky a Go Go, Claude \\"Kickboy Face\\" Bessy of Slash magazine suggests that they perform at an open mic across the street. The Germs give an impromptu performance of their song \\"Sex Boy\\", but do not know how to play their instruments and are heckled by the audience. Jan Paul responds by throwing flour at them and dipping the microphone in peanut butter; the band is thrown out but excited by the experience. Jan Paul comes up with pseudonyms for the members: Georg becomes Pat Smear, Terri becomes Lorna Doom, and Becky becomes Donna Rhia, while Belinda bows out of the band.

I removed beef from my diet and added pork, as the  OPTIONS: A). beef turned out to be unhealthy.; B). pork turned out to be unhealthy.;","output":"I removed beef from my diet and added pork, as the beef turned out to be unhealthy. The decision came after I started doing some research on the environmental and health impacts of various meats. I found that not only was beef production contributing to a massive amount of greenhouse gas emissions, but it was also a significant source of cholesterol and saturated fat. At first, I was hesitant to make the change, but then I discovered the numerous benefits that pork provided. From the nutritional aspect, it boasted high-quality proteins, vitamins, and minerals while being relatively low in sodium and calories. As an added bonus, certain cuts of pork, such as tenderloin and loin chops, were considered lean meats. This meant they had less fat and cholesterol content than their beef counterparts. Moreover, I found that the environmental impact of pork production was considerably lower than beef, which appealed to my ecological conscience. Rearing pigs required fewer inputs like water, feed, and land, and produced less methane emissions per kilogram of meat than cattle. This meant that by switching to pork, I was able to reduce my carbon footprint without sacrificing my love for flavorful meats. Of course, making this lifestyle change did not come without its challenges. One of the first hurdles I had to overcome was developing a new set of recipes and cooking techniques. Since pork was leaner than beef, it was crucial to learn different ways of preparing it to avoid dry, overcooked meals. Fortunately, the versatility of pork allowed me to experiment with several cooking methods like roasting, slow cooking, grilling, and pan-frying. As I began to research and try out different pork recipes, I discovered a wide range of dishes from all around the world. Some of my favorites included American pulled pork, Chinese char siu, Italian porchetta, and German schnitzel. This culinary journey not only introduced me to various flavors and cooking styles, but also helped broaden my understanding of different cultures through the lens of food. Another challenge I faced was dealing with the social aspect of switching to pork. Family and friends who were fond of beef raised their eyebrows at my newfound choice. But rather than debating about the merits of each meat, I decided to showcase the deliciousness of pork through potlucks, barbecues, and dinner parties.  The dinners were a success, and soon, even the most steadfast beef lovers were surprised at how much they enjoyed the pork dishes. It was also a fantastic opportunity to educate others about the health and environmental reasons behind my decision, resulting in some of my friends reevaluating their own dietary choices. Gradually, pork became an integral part of my culinary life, and the transition from beef to pork was smoother than I had initially anticipated. The benefits I experienced ranged from improved health, reduced environmental impact, and cultivating a more diverse palate. With the variety of flavors, cuts, and global recipes available, I find my meals much more satisfying and enjoyable. In conclusion, removing beef from my diet and embracing pork was one of the best decisions I've made in terms of both personal health and environmental consciousness. The journey has been a dynamic and enriching experience, and I am glad to have made the switch. I believe that it's essential to stay informed about the impacts of our food choices, and being open to change will ultimately lead to improved well-being for ourselves and the planet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: James was printing on his printer and the paper got stuck.  Then when it was unjammed, he had to clear what? Possible A: ink, noise, use paper, hard copy, queue  Why is \\"queue\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer is:","output":"\\"Queue\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense in this context because it directly addresses the issue that arose when James' printer experienced a paper jam. A queue, in the context of printers, refers to the list of pending print jobs waiting to be executed by the printer. When a printer experiences an issue like a paper jam, the print jobs may not be completed in the order they were received or may be halted altogether, requiring the user to clear the queue and reissue the print commands. To better understand why \\"queue\\" is a sensible answer in this scenario, let's briefly analyze the other options presented: 1. Ink: While a paper jam could potentially cause ink-related issues, such as ink smudging or cartridge misalignments, the primary concern after resolving a paper jam is to ensure that the printer can resume processing print jobs effectively. Clearing the ink is more relevant to correcting an ink-related problem and is not directly related to the paper jam or resuming print jobs. 2. Noise: While printers can undoubtedly make noise when they encounter an issue such as a paper jam, the noise itself is not something that James would have to clear or address after unjamming the paper. Noise is merely a symptom of the problem and not the issue that needs to be resolved. 3. Use paper: \\"Use paper\\" is a somewhat vague and unclear option. It doesn't directly address the paper jam issue or the process of resuming print jobs. It may be related to the idea of replacing or refilling the paper supply, but that is not the primary concern after a paper jam is resolved. 4. Hard copy: A hard copy refers to a printed document, and clearing a hard copy is not relevant to the paper jam scenario. After unjamming the paper, James' focus would be on ensuring the printer can continue with the pending print jobs, not clearing a specific hard copy. In conclusion, \\"queue\\" is the answer that aligns with human common sense because it directly addresses the primary concern after a paper jam – ensuring that the printer can resume processing the list of pending print jobs effectively. Clearing the queue will help James get his printer back on track and continue printing without further issues, whereas the other options do not address the main concern as effectively."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Having left out David Warner because of an incident in the early hours of Sunday, Australia made 243-8 as Adam Voges struck 71 and George Bailey 55. New Zealand were 51-2 when rain arrived after 15 overs, five overs short of the number needed for a result. As a consequence, England will qualify for the semi-finals if they beat Sri Lanka at The Oval on Thursday. The abandonment favours New Zealand, who beat Sri Lanka on Sunday, rather more than Australia, who were well placed in this contest after losing their opening Group A match to England. It was yet another difficult day for Mickey Arthur's team ahead of the Ashes series which begins on 10 July. Captain Michael Clarke remained in London having treatment on a long-standing back injury, and there was further disruption to the squad - this time self-inflicted - as details emerged of Warner's alleged \\"unprovoked attack\\" on England batsman Joe Root in a Birmingham bar, which resulted in the Australia opener being placed on 12th-man duties to carry drinks of a different kind. This followed the 26-year-old's recent fine for comments made on Twitter, and four members of the squad being disciplined over \\"Homework-gate\\" during the 4-0 whitewash in India this year. Australia 85 wins, New Zealand 34, no-results 6 Their run of ill fortune briefly abated when Australia won the toss but soon returned as two wickets fell in the first 19 balls. Shane Watson edged to wicketkeeper Luke Ronchi, the New Zealand-born former Australia player, to give Mitchell McClenaghan the first of four wickets. Phil Hughes was run out for a duck by a Martin Guptill direct hit after hesitation between the batsmen, and Daniel Vettori bowled tidily with great variations of flight and pace to concede just 23 runs in 10 overs, despite a troublesome Achilles that left him hobbling in the field. Stand-in Australia skipper Bailey played with an effectiveness that was particularly commendable given the trying circumstances surrounding his team. Unspectacular both in shot selection and demeanour, Bailey calmly restored order in a partnership of 64 with Matthew Wade and then 77 in 16 overs with the purposeful Voges. 8 - Mitchell McClenaghan (NZ) 7 - Ravindra Jadeja (Ind) 7 - Ryan McLaren (SA) 5 - Sunil Narine (WI) In his 18th ODI, 33-year-old Voges - yet to play a Test and not part of the Ashes squad - struck the ball crisply in a 76-ball innings that ended in the 44th over when he drove a McClenaghan full toss to short extra-cover. Glenn Maxwell added an enterprising unbeaten 29, featuring the only two sixes of the innings, both of which came in the penultimate over, bowled by spinner Kane Williamson. It took Australia to a total that had been overhauled only three times in 20 previous ODIs at the ground. With the floodlights on in the increasing gloom, New Zealand's task became more difficult when Guptill sliced Clint McKay to point in the fourth over and Ronchi - who played two ODIs for Australia in 2008 but who now has only 45 runs in five innings for the Kiwis - steered the same bowler to gully. But rain intervened and the match was finally called off at 18:23 BST, meaning reigning champions Australia must beat Sri Lanka in their final match on Monday to have any chance of continuing their defence of the trophy.

This comprehensive examination aims to assess workers' experiences, work environment, and related factors in order to determine the extent of the alleged labor violations occurring in these factories. The inspection process will cover various facilities in different locations across China, including those operated by Foxconn in both Shenzhen and Chengdu. This approach is necessary to allow the FLA to gain an accurate understanding of the working conditions and practices faced by employees in companies that collaborate with Apple. Following the examination, the FLA's findings will be compiled and analyzed to determine any patterns or systemic issues that may exist in these suppliers' operations.  In cases where violations are identified, the FLA will work with Apple and the suppliers to develop strategies and plans to address the issues found. This process will help ensure the protection of workers' rights and foster a healthy work environment within the supply chain. Furthermore, the FLA's involvement in this investigation serves as an external validation of Apple's commitment to maintain and improve labor rights and work conditions in its supply chain. Moving forward, Apple's willingness to cooperate with the FLA sends a strong message to other technology corporations – emphasizing the importance of transparency and accountability when it comes to labor practices. In conclusion, the most logical option to complete this passage is by stating that the FLA is planning to interview thousands of employees at several Apple suppliers.

In this instance, the verb is \\"to tell\\" (in the past tense), which denotes the act of narrating or conveying. Object (O): \\"the story\\" - The object in the sentence is the entity that is receiving the action or being affected by it. Here, \\"the story\\" is the subject matter that the speaker is communicating. 2. Prepositional phrase: The sentence also includes a prepositional phrase, which provides additional information about the action or relationship between the words in the sentence. Preposition: \\"to\\" - The preposition \\"to\\" is used in this context to indicate the recipient of the action. Object of the preposition: \\"Daniel\\" - The object of the preposition conveys who is affected by or involved in the action; in this case, \\"Daniel\\" is the individual to whom the story is being told. 3.

Nevada is the 7th most extensive, the 34th most populous, and the 9th least densely populated of the 50 United States. Nearly three-quarters of Nevada's people live in Clark County, which contains the Las VegasParadise metropolitan area where three of the state's four largest incorporated cities are located. Nevada's capital is Carson City. Nevada is officially known as the \\"Silver State\\" because of the importance of silver to its history and economy. It is also known as the \\"Battle Born State\\", because it achieved statehood during the Civil War (the words \\"Battle Born\\" also appear on the state flag); as the \\"Sage-brush State\\", for the native plant of the same name; and as the \\"Sage-hen State\\". Nevada borders Oregon to the northwest, Idaho to the northeast, California to the west, Arizona to the southeast and Utah to the east.  - A mountain man is a male trapper and explorer who lives in the wilderness. Mountain men were most common in the North American Rocky Mountains from about 1810 through to the 1880s (with a peak population in the early 1840s). They were instrumental in opening up the various Emigrant Trails (widened into wagon roads) allowing Americans in the east to settle the new territories of the far west by organized wagon trains traveling over roads explored and in many cases, physically improved by the mountain men and the big fur companies originally to serve the mule train based inland fur trade.  - Suicide is the act of intentionally causing one's own death. Risk factors include mental disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, personality disorders, alcoholism, or substance misuse. Others are impulsive acts due to stress such as from financial difficulties, troubles with relationships, or from bullying. Those who have previously attempted suicide are at higher risk for future attempts. Suicide prevention efforts include limiting access to method of suicide, such as firearms and poisons, treating mental disorders and substance misuse, proper media reporting of suicide, and improving economic conditions. Although crisis hotlines are common, there is little evidence for their effectiveness. The most commonly used method of suicide varies between countries, and is partly related to the availability of effective means. Common methods include hanging, pesticide poisoning, and firearms. Suicide resulted in 842,000 deaths globally in 2013 (up from 712,000 deaths in 1990). This makes it the 10th leading cause of death worldwide. Approximately 0.5% to 1.4% of people die by suicide, about 12 per 100,000 persons per year. Three quarters of suicides globally occur in the developing world. Rates of completed suicides are generally higher in men than in women, ranging from 1.5 times as much in the developing world to 3.5 times in the developed world. Suicide is generally most common among those over the age of 70; however, in certain countries those aged between 15 and 30 are at highest risk. There are an estimated 10 to 20 million non-fatal attempted suicides every year. Non-fatal suicide attempts may lead to injury and long-term disabilities. In the Western world, attempts are more common in young people and females. Views on suicide have been influenced by broad existential themes such as religion, honor, and the meaning of life. The Abrahamic religions traditionally consider suicide an offense towards God due to the belief in the sanctity of life. During the samurai era in Japan, a form of...  - Lethal injection is the practice of injecting one or more drugs into a person (typically a barbiturate, paralytic, and potassium solution) for the express purpose of causing immediate death. The main application for this procedure is capital punishment, but the term may also be applied in a broad sense to euthanasia and suicide. It first renders the person unconscious, and then stops the breathing and heart, in that order.  - Lawrence Colwell , Jr. , aka Charles Durrant , a 35 - year - old white male , was voluntarily executed by lethal injection at the Nevada State Prison in Carson City , Nevada on March 26 , 2004 . Colwell was found guilty of the 1994 murder of Frank Rosenstock , a 76 - year - old white male . Colwell , who was 25 years old when he committed the capital crime , was sentenced to death on February 25 , 1995 . He was the 905th execution in US since 1976 .  - Carson City, officially the Consolidated Municipality of Carson City, is an independent city and the capital of the US state of Nevada, named after the mountain man Kit Carson. As of the 2010 census, the population was 55,274. The majority of the population of the town lives in Eagle Valley, on the eastern edge of the Carson Range, a branch of the Sierra Nevada, about south of Reno. The town originated as a stopover for California bound emigrants, but developed into a city with the Comstock Lode, a silver strike in the mountains to the northeast. The city has served as the capital of Nevada since statehood in 1864 and for much of its history was a hub for the Virginia and Truckee Railroad, although the tracks were removed in the 1950s. Prior to 1969, Carson City was the county seat of Ormsby County. In 1969, the county was abolished, and its territory was merged with Carson City to form the Consolidated Municipality of Carson City. With the consolidation, the city limits today extend west across the Sierra Nevada to the California state line in the middle of Lake Tahoe. Like other independent cities in the United States, it is treated as a county-equivalent for census purposes.    What entity does 'lawrence colwell' has the relation 'date of birth' with?

Denmark boss blames Christian Eriksen for lack of impact in defeat. Cristiano Ronaldo's late header sealed win for Portugal in Euro 2016 tie. Morten Olsen says Eriksen should have improved more at Tottenham. Eriksen admits he wasn't near his best during the Portugal defeat. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Denmark Boss Casts Shade on Christian Eriksen Amidst Euro 2016 Defeat by Portugal The national manager of Denmark's football team, Morten Olsen, has publicly criticized star player Christian Eriksen for his sub-par performance in Denmark's recent loss to Portugal in the Euro 2016 tie. Cristiano Ronaldo's late header sealed the victory for Portugal, propelling his team to a position of strength and marking a disappointing defeat for the Danes. Olsen appeared evidently frustrated as he highlighted Eriksen's unsatisfactory impact during the vital match. It is unusual for a leader to single out a player so directly, but Olsen opted for candid commentary rather than sugar-coating his feelings. The Danish manager believes that Eriksen should have shown significant improvement during his tenure at Tottenham Hotspur, one of the English Premier League's most renowned clubs. Olsen's words indicate his expectations for Eriksen to leverage his experience and learning from the English club onto international stages such as the Euro 2016. \\"Christian Eriksen was nowhere near his best. It's more than a year since we last saw him play as we know he can,\\" Olsen rued during the press conference, referencing Eriksen's previous notable performances for the national team. To his credit, Christian Eriksen was forthright in acknowledging his lackluster showing during the match against Portugal. He admitted that he wasn't in top form, which was ostensibly evident in Denmark's decreasing attacking prowess during the game that ultimately led to a victory for Portugal, thanks to a late header from Cristiano Ronaldo. Both Olsen's criticism and Eriksen's self-admittance reflect the high standards and expectations placed on the Tottenham Hotspur midfielder's shoulders. As a crucial component of Denmark's national team, Eriksen's form often dictates the team's results. Eriksen's lack of impact in a key match like the Euro 2016 tie certainly didn't go unnoticed. Moving forward, Eriksen will have to shoulder the burden of criticism and match it with an improved performance in Denmark's future fixtures. Whether this public critique by Morten Olsen will help or hinder Eriksen’s future performance depends on how well he can transform the critique into motivation, instead of a stumbling block. Will this spur him to elevate his game, or will it add pressure that could influence his future performance negatively?

Possible answers: (a). no. (b). yes.","output":"To determine if Donald Trump's campaign performance, actions, and purported business dealing will hurt his future business dealings, I will analyze the potential impact of these factors on his business reputation and opportunities.  Step 1: Assess the impact of Trump's campaign performance on his business reputation. - His campaign was marked by controversy and polarizing views. This might have alienated some potential business partners, but at the same time, it has raised his public profile and potentially attracted others who support his political stances. Therefore, the impact of his campaign performance on future business dealings could be mixed. Step 2: Evaluate the potential consequences of actions taken during the presidency for his businesses. - Some policies enacted during Trump's presidency might have positively or negatively affected certain industries or markets. The long-term effects of these actions on his future business dealings will depend on the specific policies and their impacts on industries he is involved in. Step 3: Consider the role of purported business dealings in shaping Trump's business reputation and opportunities. - Allegations of unethical business practices, if proven to be true, could hurt his reputation and discourage potential partners. If such allegations remain unproven or are disproven, their impact on his future business opportunities might be minimal. Upon evaluating these factors, I conclude that the answer to the first question is not a simple yes or no, but rather, it depends on the extent to which the different aspects of his campaign, actions, and business dealings affect his reputation and opportunities. Regarding the question about TIN number registration expenses, this is a completely unrelated question and does not have the same meaning as the first one. It seems to inquire about expenses related to the registration of a Taxpayer Identification Number. The answer to the second question, \\"Do those questions have the same meaning?\\" is (a) no, as they explore entirely different topics."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Massachusetts and Vermont resume tax refund payments after fraud concerns Massachusetts and Vermont have started to release tax refunds that were held for more intense review in recent days because of widespread reports of fraudulent filings tied to TurboTax. The Massachusetts Department of Revenue said it has cleared more than 113,000 of the 160,000 returns it set aside for additional scrutiny last week and sent refunds to those taxpayers. Of the more than 45,000 returns still under review, about 7,500 have been set aside as problematic and in some cases will require additional proof of identity before they are released. In Vermont, state officials are slowly sending out refunds, but some residents are likely to get paper checks instead of electronic deposits, to further reduce the likelihood that money is going to criminals, said Mary Peterson, the state’s tax commissioner. Criminals who file fraudulent returns typically request direct deposit of the refunds to debit cards, which are difficult to trace, Peterson said. “We may need that last backstop,” she said. Concerns about an increase in fraudulent returns, especially those filed through TurboTax, a popular tax-preparation software, caused an early disruption to the tax season. About 18 states across the country, from Georgia to Utah, last week reported a significant increase in fraudulent state tax returns. Federal tax filings were not affected. The problems forced TurboTax, which is used for about 30 million state returns each year, to temporarily halt processing state tax filings last Friday as it investigated the situation and whether it was the victim of a data breach. Intuit, the California software firm behind TurboTax, said it had not been hacked. Instead, company officials blamed large-scale security breaches of retailers and hospitals in the past year for making consumer information, such as Social Security numbers, readily available to cybercriminals, who use it to file fraudulent tax paperwork. Intuit, however, put additional security in place for TurboTax users, including multiple levels of authentication to identify filers. The FBI is investigating the fraudulent filings. Vermont has so far stopped 136 suspicious returns, compared to 88 at the same time last year, Peterson said. In many cases, state examiners are finding that criminals got access to residents’ tax paperwork from last year and are using that information to file fake returns, she said. Vermont usually has two tax workers reviewing individual returns, But this year, 14 are processing the filings, which will probably mean delays in refunds, Peterson said. In Massachusetts, an official said, some residents will get letters requesting more information to confirm their identities before refunds are released.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition.  - Argentina, officially the Argentine Republic, is a federal republic in the southern half of South America. Sharing the bulk of the Southern Cone with its neighbor Chile to the west, the country is also bordered by Bolivia and Paraguay to the north, Brazil to the northeast, Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the Drake Passage to the south. With a mainland area of , Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world, the second largest in Latin America, and the largest Spanish-speaking one. The country is subdivided into twenty-three provinces (singular \\"provincia\\") and one autonomous city (\\"ciudad autónoma\\"), Buenos Aires, which is the federal capital of the nation as decided by Congress. The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions, but exist under a federal system.  - Chilecebus carrascoensis is an extinct species of New World monkey that lived in what is now Chile during the Early Miocene some 20 million years ago . It had a body mass of about 1.3 pounds ( 600 grams ) .  - Spider monkeys of the genus Ateles are New World monkeys in the subfamily Atelinae, family Atelidae. Like other atelines, they are found in tropical forests of Central and South America, from southern Mexico to Brazil. The genus contains seven species, all of which are under threat; the black-headed spider monkey, and brown spider monkey are critically endangered.  - A prehensile tail is the tail of an animal that has adapted to be able to grasp or hold objects. Fully prehensile tails can be used to hold and manipulate objects, and in particular to aid arboreal creatures in finding and eating food in the trees. If the tail cannot be used for this it is considered only partially prehensile - such tails are often used to anchor an animal's body to dangle from a branch, or as an aid for climbing. The term \\"prehensile\\" means \\"able to grasp\\" (from the Latin \\"prehendere\\", to take hold of, to grasp).  - The Andes or Andean Mountains are the longest continental mountain range in the world. They are a continuous range of highlands along the western edge of South America. This range is about long, about wide (widest between 18° south and 20° south latitude), and of an average height of about . The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile.  - The Old World monkeys or Cercopithecidae are a family of primates, the only family in the superfamily Cercopithecoidea in the clade (or parvorder) of Catarrhini.  - The Callitrichidae (also called Arctopitheci or Hapalidae) are a family of New World monkeys, including marmosets and tamarins. At times, this group of animals has been regarded as a subfamily, called Callitrichinae, of the family Cebidae.  - Oceania (or ), also known as Oceanica, is a region centred on the islands of the tropical Pacific Ocean. Opinions of what constitutes Oceania range from its three subregions of Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia to, more broadly, the entire insular region between Southeast Asia and the Americas, including Australasia and the Malay Archipelago.  - New World monkeys are the five families of primates that are found in Central and South America and portions of Mexico: Callitrichidae, Cebidae, Aotidae, Pitheciidae, and Atelidae. The five families are ranked together as the Platyrrhini parvorder and the Ceboidea superfamily, which are essentially synonymous since Ceboidea is the only living platyrrhine superfamily. Platyrhini means flat-nosed, and their noses are flatter than those of other simians, with sideways-facing nostrils. Monkeys in the family Atelidae, such as the spider monkey, are the only primates to have prehensile tails. New World monkeys' closest relatives are the other simians, the Catarrhini (\\"down-nosed,\\" comprising Old World monkeys and apes). New World monkeys descend from African simians that colonized South America, a line that split off about 40 million years ago.  - Easter Island is a Chilean island in the southeastern Pacific Ocean, at the southeasternmost point of the Polynesian Triangle. Easter Island is famous for its 887 extant monumental statues, called \\"moai\\", created by the early Rapa Nui people. In 1995, UNESCO named Easter Island a World Heritage Site, with much of the island protected within Rapa Nui National Park.  - Bolivia (; ), officially known as the Plurinational State of Bolivia, is a landlocked country located in western-central South America. It is bordered to the north and east by Brazil, to the southeast by Paraguay, to the south by Argentina, to the southwest by Chile, and to the northwest by Peru. One-third of the country is the Andean mountain range, with one of its largest cities and principal economic centers, El Alto, located on the Altiplano. Bolivia is one of two landlocked countries (the other is Paraguay) that lie outside Afro-Eurasia. Bolivia is the largest landlocked country in the Americas.  - Apes (Hominoidea) are a branch of Old World tailless anthropoid primates native to Africa and Southeast Asia. They are the sister group of Old World monkeys, together forming the catarrhine clade. They are distinguished from other primates by a wider degree of freedom of motion at the shoulder joint as evolved by the influence of brachiation. There are two extant branches of the superfamily Hominoidea: the gibbons, or lesser apes; and the hominids, or great apes.  - Catarrhini is one of the two subdivisions of the simians, the other being the plathyrrhine (New World monkeys). The Catarrhini contains the Old World monkeys and the apes; the latter of which are in turn further divided into the lesser apes or gibbons and the great apes, consisting of the orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans. The Catarrhine are all native to Africa and Asia. Members of this parvorder are called catarrhines.  - The Pitheciidae are one of the five families of New World monkeys now recognised. Formerly, they were included in the family Atelidae. The family includes the titis, saki monkeys and uakaris. Most species are native to the Amazonia region of Brazil, with some being found from Colombia in the north to Bolivia in the south.  - The Atelidae are one of the five families of New World monkeys now recognised. It was formerly included in the family Cebidae. Atelids are generally larger monkeys; the family includes the howler, spider, woolly, and woolly spider monkeys (the latter being the largest of the New World monkeys). They are found throughout the forested regions of Central and South America, from Mexico to northern Argentina.  - The Cebidae are one of the five families of New World monkeys now recognised. It includes the capuchin monkeys and squirrel monkeys. These species are found throughout tropical and subtropical South and Central America.  - Chile, officially the Republic of Chile, is a South American country occupying a long, narrow strip of land between the Andes to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west. It borders Peru to the north, Bolivia to the northeast, Argentina to the east, and the Drake Passage in the far south. Chilean territory includes the Pacific islands of Juan Fernández, Salas y Gómez, Desventuradas, and Easter Island in Oceania. Chile also claims about of Antarctica, although all claims are suspended under the Antarctic Treaty.  - A primate is a mammal of the order Primates (Latin: \\"prime, first rank\\"). In taxonomy, primates include two distinct lineages, strepsirrhines and haplorhines. Primates arose from ancestors that lived in the trees of tropical forests; many primate characteristics represent adaptations to life in this challenging three-dimensional environment. Most primate species remain at least partly arboreal.  - Monkeys are haplorhine (\\"dry-nosed\\") primates, a group generally possessing tails and consisting of about 260 known living species. There are two distinct lineages of monkeys: New World Monkeys and catarrhines. Apes emerged within the catarrhines with the Old World monkeys as a sister group, so cladistically they are monkeys as well. However, traditionally apes are not considered monkeys, rendering this grouping paraphyletic. The equivalent monophyletic clade are the simians. Many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are species that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons. Most species are also active during the day (diurnal). Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent, particularly Old World monkeys.    What entity does 'chilecebus' has the relation 'parent taxon' with?

Investors cheered the news, sending HP's shares up nearly 5% in early trading on Wall Street. The firm is now in the fourth year of its five-year turnaround plan, aimed at helping the firm adapt to the new era of mobile and online computing. Current chief executive Meg Whitman, who has the job of reviving the fortunes of the 75-year-old firm, will head the new spin-off, Hewlett Packard Enterprise. This will house the corporate hardware and services operations. She will also be chairman of HP's printing and PC business, HP Inc, which last quarter accounted for about half its revenue and profit. Ms Whitman said the split would give both firms the \\"flexibility they need to adapt quickly to market and customer dynamics\\". \\"We can [now] more aggressively go after the opportunities created by a rapidly changing market,\\" she added. HP said it expected the division to be complete by the end of the 2015 financial year. Analysts said it was still unclear how the split would help HP to compete against its rivals, and whether the two divisions would ultimately end up competing with one another. \\"Both operations have seen declining revenue, and many are likely to question whether independence can change their fortunes,\\" said Arnaud Gagneux at analyst firm CCS Insight. \\"The cost of the separate marketing, finance and purchasing departments for the two entities will increase HP's spending, and the loss of some economies of scale may affect HP when purchasing components.\\" However, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Brian White said that separating into two companies would give HP the option to sell off one or even both businesses if an attractive offer was made. The division of HP's businesses comes at a time when other large tech firms are being urged to break up. Last week, online auction site eBay announced it was splitting off its payments system PayPal into a separate company. HP has been under pressure from newer rivals such as Chinese firm Lenovo, which overtook HP as the world's largest PC maker in 2012. Third-ranked US rival Dell was taken private last year. Founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in 1939, HP helped usher in the PC revolution and now has more than 300,000 employees globally.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do these questions have the same meaning? To what degree do snow chains damage your tires or car? What is better for driving in snow, AWD or front wheel drive with snow tires?","output":"No, these two questions do not have the same meaning. They address two different aspects of driving in snowy conditions. Question 1: To what degree do snow chains damage your tires or car? This question focuses on the potential negative impacts of using snow chains on your tires or car. Snow chains are specifically designed to provide additional traction when traveling in snowy or icy conditions, and are typically mounted on the drive wheels of a vehicle. The question aims to understand what degree of damage, if any, can be caused by using snow chains. Answer: Using snow chains correctly may cause minimal wear and tear on the tires, which is generally considered acceptable considering the benefits they provide in terms of safety and maneuverability in challenging winter conditions. Snow chains can cause damage, however, if they are not installed correctly, are poorly maintained or used improperly. Any of these factors can lead to debris and chain components coming loose, causing damage to the tires or other parts of the car. To minimize any potential damage, the best approach is to follow the manufacturer's instructions for installation and usage, maintain the snow chains in good condition, and practice driving with them at appropriate speeds and in suitable conditions. Question 2: What is better for driving in snow, AWD or front-wheel drive with snow tires? This question seeks to understand which option is better suited for traversing snow-covered roads: all-wheel drive (AWD) or front-wheel drive equipped with snow tires. AWD and front-wheel drive are types of drivetrain systems, while snow tires are a type of tire specifically designed for snowy conditions. Answer: There isn't a definitive answer to this question as the suitability of either option might depend on the specific driving conditions and individual preferences. Here are some factors to consider for each option: 1. All-Wheel Drive (AWD) - AWD provides power to all four wheels, allowing for better traction and control in slippery conditions. This can help maintain grip in snow, as well as on ice, sand, and mud. AWD is advantageous in situations where roads are consistently covered or have significant snowfall. However, it is important to bear in mind that AWD may not provide a significant improvement in stopping distance or braking performance compared to front-wheel drive, which might still necessitate the use of snow tires. 2. Front-Wheel Drive with Snow Tires - Front-wheel drive vehicles typically handle better on slippery surfaces than rear-wheel drive vehicles, as the engine's weight is concentrated on the front wheels. Combining front-wheel drive with snow tires can improve traction and handling in snowy conditions. Snow tires are specifically designed to maximize grip on ice and snow. The main advantage of this option is that the use of snow tires can significantly improve braking performance, which is crucial for drivers in snowy or icy conditions. In conclusion, the choice between AWD and front-wheel drive with snow tires depends on various factors such as the type of roads, local weather conditions, budget considerations, and personal preferences. All-wheel drive has its advantages for consistently snow-covered roads and providing improved traction, while the combination of front-wheel drive and snow tires can greatly improve overall handling and stopping distances in wintry conditions. It is important to make an informed decision based on location, driving habits, and the demands of local weather conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

That “66”indicated for us an external disaster about to unload in our emergency room. The two policemen who were mortally injured and died on our stretchers were personal friends and one the boyfriend of one of the nurses. Their injuries were from machine guns where the flesh is riddled with explosive elements as opposed to a gunshot wounds where there is both an entry and exit site. In our Trauma and Triage Course we never learned about machine gun injuries. Additionally there were the criminals who were also injured and of course we needed to treat them as any other patient regardless of their behavior. The friends of the injured policemen were trying to get to these villains and it was just the most awful evening of my life. To this day I remember feeling nauseous in a way I had never felt before. We had debriefing sessions for weeks and of course were very upset for months. The wounds we had to address, the insertion of chest tubes and everything else all in such a rapid manner was indeed a more than gross situation. There was even open heart massage. Private doctors reported to help; many are not trained or current in emergency medicine; much is left to critical care nurses in a community hospital that is not a teaching institution with residents and interns on staff. Recently one of the women involved in this crime came up for parole. Of course there was great opposition from the community relative to her release. She was young and that was 38 years ago. I believe people deserve a second chance, but of course this is a very controversial matter.

(II) mustard was already expired.","output":"The pesto in the store was not as delicious as the mustard, because the pesto was already expired. This caused it to lose its freshness and vibrant flavors, which are essential components that make pesto enjoyable and appetizing. Mustard, on the other hand, remained a better option for consumers due to its unexpired status and therefore managed to retain its tangy and bold taste.  When store-bought pesto expires, it goes through some changes in texture, aroma, and flavor. Its once bright green color may turn into a dull, unappetizing shade, and the fresh basil scent diminishes gradually. Additionally, the oil present in pesto can become rancid, imparting an off-putting taste to the sauce. Nutritional degradation can also occur over time, which reduces the health benefits of the ingredients used in creating pesto. Comparatively, mustard provides a unique, strong flavor that pleases the palate, mostly by retaining its pungency and thickness when adequately stored and unexpired. Mustard seeds are ground and mixed with various ingredients such as vinegar, water, salt, and other seasonings to give it its distinctive flavor. Due to the presence of vinegar and other natural preservatives in mustard recipes, it usually has a longer shelf-life than pesto, allowing it to maintain its taste for more extended periods. To enjoy the best of both pesto and mustard, it is essential to pay close attention to the expiration dates of the products. Choosing fresh and unexpired sauces will ensure the most delicious and satisfying culinary experience. In the situation described, the expired pesto is unable to hold its own against the unexpired mustard, resulting in a clear preference towards the mustard as a condiment and flavorful ingredient."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer for the question: What was the first name of Wolfgang Mozart's father? from the following article ?  In a letter to his friend and landlord Johann Lorenz Hagenauer (1712–1792), a prominent Salzburg merchant, written after the tour, Leopold quotes the German diplomat Friedrich Melchior, Baron von Grimm, who after hearing the children play had said: \\"Now for once in my life I have seen a miracle: this is the first\\". Leopold believed that it was his duty to proclaim this miracle to the world, otherwise he would be \\"the most ungrateful creature\\". He was said to have described Wolfgang as \\"The miracle which God let be born in Salzburg.\\" Mozart biographer Wolfgang Hildesheimer has suggested that, at least in the case of Wolfgang, this venture was premature: \\"Too soon, [the] father dragged [the] son all over Western Europe for years. This continual change of scene would have worn out even a robust child...\\" However, there is little evidence to suggest that Wolfgang was physically harmed or musically hindered by these childhood exertions; it seems that he felt equal to the challenge from the start.Leopold wanted to begin the tour as soon as possible—the younger the children were, the more spectacular would be the demonstration of their gifts. The route he intended to take included southern Germany, the Austrian Netherlands, Paris, Switzerland and possibly northern Italy. The London leg was only added after urgings during the Paris visit, and the eventual Dutch trip was an unplanned detour. The plan was to take in as many princely European courts as possible, as well as the great cultural capitals—Leopold was relying on his professional musical network and on his more recent social contacts to obtain invitations from the royal courts. Practical assistance came from Hagenauer, whose trading connections in the major cities would supply the Mozarts with what were effectively banking facilities. These would enable them to obtain money en route, while waiting for the proceeds from their performances to accumulate.Wolfgang prepared for the tour by perfecting himself on the violin, which he had learned to play apparently...

QUEBEC CITY — Emotions were on display when U.S. President Donald Trump met other G-7 leaders at their annual summit in Canada on Friday, but the discussions were civilized and diplomatic, according to sources. Trump held firm on asserting the United States is disadvantaged when it comes to trade with its European allies. “The other leaders presented their numbers and Trump presented his,” a G-7 official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Reuters news agency. “As expected he did not budge. This is probably not because he does not understand, but because of domestic reasons.” At a bilateral meeting later with the summit's host, Justin Trudeau, the U.S. president joked that the Canadian prime minister had agreed to “cut all tariffs.” Despite the two leaders exchanging criticism of each other’s trade policies the previous day, Trump described the cross-border relationship as very good, stating “we’re actually working on cutting tariffs and making it all very fair for both countries. And we’ve made a lot of progress today. We’ll see how it all works out.” In a subsequent sit-down meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump said “the United States has had a very big trade deficit for many years with the European Union and we are working it out. And Emmanuel’s been very helpful in that regard.” Macron responded that he had a “very direct and open discussion” with Trump and \\"there is a critical path that is a way to progress all together.” Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, confirms she met on Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to discuss the tariffs and the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). She said Canada, however, will not change its mind about the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs which she termed “illegal.” Trump imposed the tariffs on the grounds that weak domestic industries could affect U.S. national security. America’s closest allies, Canada, Mexico and the European Union, are introducing retaliatory tariffs. According to the above context, answer the following question. What is probably true about the relationship between US and Canada after Trump met with Canada's leader?

Article: Acute kidney failure is usually diagnosed in people who are already hospitalized. However, if you’re not in the hospital, have a common underlying cause of kidney failure, and experience symptoms, you’ll need to see a doctor immediately.  Common causes of acute kidney failure include injury, blood clots, urethral blockages, severe dehydration, drug overdose, alcohol abuse, and infection. Symptoms of kidney failure include urination changes (such as producing little or no urine), fatigue or sluggish movements, metallic taste in your mouth, pain between your ribs and hips, seizures, and swelling due to water retention, especially in your legs, ankles and feet. Your doctor will need to perform tests to diagnose the underlying cause. They’ll then clear a blockage or clot, administer antibiotics, or take other steps to treat the underlying condition. While treating the underlying cause, you’ll receive medication to help control your fluid levels and blood potassium. During and after treatment, you’ll need to eat more healthy carbohydrates, such as fruits and vegetables. You’ll also need to limit the amounts of protein, salt, and potassium in your diet.  High protein foods include red meat, poultry, and eggs. Instead of these, you’d need to eat more fruits, vegetables, and foods that are high in fiber, like brown rice, lentils, and raspberries.   You’ll also need to swap high potassium foods, such as bananas, oranges, and potatoes, for low potassium options, such as apples, cabbage, grapes, green beans, and strawberries.  Always read the label on prepackaged and processed foods to make sure you’re not eating things with high amounts of sodium. Some people who experience acute kidney failure require dialysis, which is a procedure that filters blood when your kidneys can’t function. It’s often only temporary, but cases of severe kidney damage might require long-term dialysis. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"Acute kidney failure can occur due to a variety of causes such as injury, blood clots, severe dehydration and alcohol abuse, among others. It may require immediate medical attention, especially in non-hospitalized cases. Symptoms include changes in urination, fatigue, unusual taste in the mouth, pain between ribs and hips, seizures, swelling in legs, ankles, and feet. Once diagnosed, the doctor focuses on treating the underline cause while also controlling fluid levels and blood potassium through medication. Dietary adjustments are needed, including increasing fruits, vegetables, and high-fiber foods, while limiting protein, salt, and potassium intake. Food labels should be read to avoid high sodium products.

He recalled feeling that it did no good to establish the CAP unless the pilots had instructions on whether they were authorized to shoot if the plane would not divert. He said the President signed off on that concept. The President said he remembered such a conversation, and that it reminded him of when he had been an interceptor pilot. The President emphasized to us that he had authorized the shootdown of hijacked aircraft. The Vice President's military aide told us he believed the Vice President spoke to the President just after entering the conference room, but he did not hear what they said. Rice, who entered the room shortly after the Vice President and sat next to him, remembered hearing him inform the President, \\"Sir, the CAPs are up. Sir, they're going to want to know what to do.\\" Then she recalled hearing him say, \\"Yes sir.\\" She believed this conversation occurred a few minutes, perhaps five, after they entered the conference room. We believe this call would have taken place sometime before 10:10 to 10:15. Among the sources that reflect other important events of that morning, there is no documentary evidence for this call, but the relevant sources are incomplete. Others nearby who were taking notes, such as the Vice President's chief of staff, Scooter Libby, who sat next to him, and Mrs. Cheney, did not note a call between the President and Vice President immediately after the Vice President entered the conference room. At 10:02, the communicators in the shelter began receiving reports from the Secret Service of an inbound aircraft-presumably hijacked-heading toward Washington. That aircraft was United 93. The Secret Service was getting this information directly from the FAA. The FAA may have been tracking the progress of United 93 on a display that showed its projected path to Washington, not its actual radar return. Thus, the Secret Service was relying on projections and was not aware the plane was already down in Pennsylvania.  Question: \\"To the Vice President's recollection, what did the President and Vice President's conversation entail?\\" Answer: \\"Rule of engagement\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","output":"Answer: Yes, the answer is correct. According to the paragraph, the Vice President's recollection of his conversation with the President involved discussing the rules of engagement for the Combat Air Patrol (CAP). The Vice President felt it was important for pilots to have instructions on whether they were authorized to shoot if the plane would not divert, and the President agreed with this idea. The President also mentioned that he had authorized the shootdown of hijacked aircraft.

Contemporary documents show that the British continued the physical occupation of Chumbi Valley until February 8, 1908, after having received the full payment from China. In early 1910, Qing China sent a military expedition of its own to Tibet for direct rule. However, the Qing dynasty was overthrown in the Xinhai Revolution, which began in October 1911. Although the Chinese forces departed once more in 1913, the First World War and the Russian Revolution isolated the now independent Tibet, reducing Western influence and interest.  Ineffectual regents ruled during the 14th Dalai Lama's infancy and China began to reassert its control, a process that culminated in 1950-1951 with the Chinese invasion of Tibet by a newly-formed Communist China. The position of British Trade Agent at Gyangzê was occupied from 1904 until 1944. It was not until 1937, with the creation of the position of \\"Head of British Mission Lhasa\\", that a British officer had a permanent posting in Lhasa itself. The British seem to have misread the military and diplomatic situation, for the Russians did not have the designs on India that the British imagined, and the campaign was politically redundant before it began. Russian arms in Tibet amounted to no more than thirty Russian government rifles, and the whole narrative of Russian influence, and the Czar's ambitions, was dropped. The defeats the Russians experienced in the Russo-Japanese war that began in February 1904 further altered perceptions of the balance of power in Asia, and the Russian threat. However, it has been argued that the campaign had \\"a profound effect upon Tibet, changing it forever, and for the worse at that, doing much to contribute to Tibet's loss of innocence.\\" Answer this question: How many years did these events span for?","output":"These events happened over a long time.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Should McDonald's Give Charles Ramsey A Reward For Heroism? Just what is McDonald's McDonald's trying to accomplish by involving itself in the horrible story of three young women held captive for over a decade in a Cleveland house? The fast-food behemoth says it wants to get in touch with Charles Ramsey, the heroic neighbor who kicked apart a door to free Amanda Berry, helped her call 911, and then gave a vivid, witty, and ultimately viral account of what happened to a local TV reporter. Explaining his sudden acts of heroism, Ramsey noted that he was “eating my McDonald’s” when he heard shouting from his neighbor’s house and sprang into action. McDonald’s came up in the 911 call too. McDonald’s says it is responding to an outpouring of social media requests that it honor or reward Ramsey somehow. Well, OK. But really, it’s the most tenuous of connections. Had Ramsey been eating a kruller from Dunkin’ Donuts, texting on a Samsung phone, or playing an XBox game (or all of those things) at the time Berry started yelling for help, would those respective corporations be expected to queue up to laud him? This is treacherous territory, because McDonald’s cannot be seen as capitalizing on a series of terrible crimes. And yet, it’s not really clear it can completely avoid that. Basking in the reflected light of Ramsey’s heroism may be one step removed, but one step removed is still pretty damn close. There are also issues of class lurking underneath the surface here, given the nexus of cheap-tasty-unhealthy fast food and the public health problems that lower-income communities face. Food corporations are desperate to promote public health and lighten up their menus. Giving Charles Ramsey a lifetime supply of Big Macs helps no one. But giving him a lifetime supply of Fruit and Walnut Salads might be seen as opportunistic or patronizing. (Unless he happens to really, really like McDonald’s Fruit and Walnut Salads.) And during a time when corporations are taking on more quasi-public functions, from slapping their names on stadiums and running prisons and municipal agencies, this only shows the limits of the trend. Really, it’s the community – the city of Cleveland – that should take the lead in formally thanking and honoring Ramsey. Ramsey, to his credit, has promised to give any reward money to the three kidnapping victims. But that only means that McDonald’s would be better off donating directly, and quietly, to any funds set up for that purpose, and stepping back. Follow me on Twitter or Facebook. My Forbes blog page is here. Summary:","output":"McDonald's wants to get in touch with Charles Ramsey, the man who heroically rescued three kidnapped women in Cleveland, after he mentioned he was eating McDonald's when he heard the commotion and sprang into action.

Given the immense value and creative potential of such animators, it is not surprising that recruitment practices in this industry have been an area of concern for the Department of Justice. This settlement comes in the wake of six other technology firms, including Pixar, agreeing to put an end to similar recruitment practices earlier this year, as noted by AP. The termination of such agreements ensures that creative professionals in the digital animation industry have the opportunity to fairly explore their options and are compensated in accordance with the market value of their skills. Stifling competition in an industry as dynamic and innovative as animation can have adverse effects on the evolution and growth of the medium. By ensuring a healthy degree of competition, companies like Lucasfilm and Pixar will be encouraged to continue pushing the boundaries of what digital animation can achieve, without resorting to unscrupulous recruitment practices that restrict the market. The settlement between Lucasfilm and the Department of Justice is an important step towards promoting fair competition and enabling the growth of the digital animation industry. It will allow creative talent to be recruited based on merit, while ensuring they receive appropriate compensation for their skills. Moreover, it will ensure that the quality and diversity of the work produced in this industry remain a testament to the incredible creative potential of digital animators. In the long run, the cancellation of the secret agreement will contribute to nurturing talent, encouraging innovation and ultimately enriching the world of animation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Indianapolis came out energized in the first quarter where the Colts picked up a field goal with three minutes remaining in the quarter, and a Kelvin Hayden interception returned for a touchdown.  The second quarter continued to see Colts dominance with a Javarris James touchdown run, extending the Colts lead to 17-0.  However, as the quarter wore on the defense began to allow larger gains and the Bengals were able to score a touchdown and a field goal in the last ten minutes of the half.  However, an Adam Vinatieri field goal gave the Colts a 20-10 lead going into halftime.  The Colts came out in the third quarter sluggish and both teams exchanged the ball throughout the rest of the quarter.  Another Vinatieri field goal gave the Colts a 23-10 lead.  With everything seeming secure, the Bengals were able to pick up a touchdown on a 19-yard pass from Carson Palmer making it a six-point game.  The Bengals onside kick attempt was successful with a late penalty by the Colts, giving the Bengals the ball at the Colts 40-yard line.  A fumble, the fifth turnover by the Bengals on the day, gave the Colts the ability to hold on to the lead and win the game 23-17, going to 6-3 on the season and taking first place in the AFC South by one game.

Question: what is a synthetic conduit? Would \\"Materials that have been used to make biologic tubes include blood vessels and skeletal muscles, while nonabsorbable and bioabsorbable synthetic tubes have been made from silicone and polyglycolide respectively.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","output":"A synthetic conduit refers to an artificially-engineered structure or device designed to serve as a functional replacement for a natural biological pathway or structure, often for the purpose of medical therapeutics or research. These man-made conduits can be composed of either organic or synthetic materials, with the objective of mimicking the properties of the original structure, such as mechanical strength and biocompatibility. The statement \\"Materials that have been used to make biologic tubes include blood vessels and skeletal muscles, while nonabsorbable and bioabsorbable synthetic tubes have been made from silicone and polyglycolide respectively.\\" is a reasonable answer to the question but can be expanded upon for a more detailed and comprehensive explanation. Biologic tubes, as the statement mentions, are made from organic materials such as blood vessels and skeletal muscles. These conduits serve as natural solutions for restoring or replacing damaged or compromised biological structures. For example, the use of autologous blood vessels, like veins or arteries, in coronary bypass surgeries helps restore proper blood circulation in patients with coronary artery disease. Similarly, skeletal muscles can be fashioned into tubes and used to reconstruct hollow organs, such as the esophagus or urethra. In situations where biologic materials are not suitable or readily available, synthetic conduits can be an alternative. These artificial structures can be made from a variety of materials based on the requirements for their specific application. Examples of synthetic conduits include nonabsorbable and bioabsorbable materials: 1. Nonabsorbable synthetic conduits: These are made from materials that remain in the body for an extended period without disintegrating or being absorbed. Silicone is a common material for nonabsorbable conduits due to its flexibility, biocompatibility, and resistance to degradation. It has been used in various medical applications, such as catheters, implants, and vascular grafts. 2. Bioabsorbable synthetic conduits: These conduits are made from materials that eventually break down and get absorbed by the body over time. One such material is polyglycolide, a biodegradable polymer that has been used in diverse applications such as sutures, tissue engineering scaffolds, and medical meshes. Bioabsorbable conduits are particularly advantageous in cases where their presence is only required temporarily, allowing the body to gradually assimilate the material once its function has been accomplished. To summarize, a synthetic conduit is an engineered device or structure with the purpose of replacing or recreating biological structures or channels. The use of both biological and synthetic materials, such as blood vessels, skeletal muscles, silicone, and polyglycolide, provides a range of options for the creation of these conduits. Each material type has specific advantages based on their application and functional requirements, making them essential tools in modern medicine and research."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What type of mills were grinding 14.1% of the nation's grain in Minnesota?, using the article: Saint Anthony Falls, the only waterfall of its height on the Mississippi, played an important part in the development of Minneapolis.  The power of the waterfall first fueled sawmills, but later it was tapped to serve flour mills.  In 1870, only a small number of flour mills were in the Minneapolis area, but by 1900 Minnesota mills were grinding 14.1% of the nation's grain.  Advances in transportation, milling technology, and water power combined to give Minneapolis a dominance in the milling industry.  Spring wheat could be sown in the spring and harvested in late summer, but it posed special problems for milling.  To get around these problems, Minneapolis millers made use of new technology.  They invented the middlings purifier, a device that used jets of air to remove the husks from the flour early in the milling process.  They also started using roller mills, as opposed to grindstones.  A series of rollers gradually broke down the kernels and integrated the gluten with the starch.  These improvements led to the production of \\"patent\\" flour, which commanded almost double the price of \\"bakers\\" or \\"clear\\" flour, which it replaced. Pillsbury and the Washburn-Crosby Company (a forerunner of General Mills) became the leaders in the Minneapolis milling industry.  This leadership in milling later declined as milling was no longer dependent on water power, but the dominance of the mills contributed greatly to the economy of Minneapolis and Minnesota, attracting people and money to the region., what would be the answer ? The answer to this question is:","output":"In 1900, the type of mills that were grinding 14.1% of the nation's grain in Minnesota were flour mills, specifically those utilizing advanced milling technology such as the middlings purifier and roller mills. These innovations allowed Minneapolis millers, including Pillsbury and Washburn-Crosby Company (a forerunner of General Mills), to dominate the industry.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Review: The narrative affirms the classic image of good versus evil in the form of a struggle of brother against brother. The main character, Lin Macadam, played by James Stewart, represents justice and righteousness. His brother, who operates under the persona of Dutch Henry Brown, played by Stephen McNally, stands for the classic stage-coach robbing western outlaw, chased by his brother for having killed their father. The world the story takes place is the classic dystopian west where the only way to prevent its inhabitants from killing each other is to take away their sidearms as soon as they enter town, and the man responsible for keeping this law and order is the classic western lawman Wyat Earp.  Present as well are such flat characters typical of the western, such as the murderous Indian warrior, the besieged cavalryman, and the bonnet-clad damsel in distress.  Another important archetype in this film, that which gives the film it's name, is a custom made Winchester rifle. The weapon can be viewed as an allegory for the rewards given to those who do things honorably. Once it is stolen from its rightful owner, it brings tragedy to everyone that comes in contact with it. In this sense it resembles other such icons like the holy grail in Raiders of the Lost Ark, and the blood stained letter in Saving Private Ryan. This gives the film an element of surrealism which is usually absent from westerns, a genre not known for esoteric themes and symbols.  Being essentially a revenge film, it shares this element with many other examples of the genre, such as Jack Arnold's No Name on the Bullet, and Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven.  There is also a tacit theme of rape in Winchester '73. Waco Johnny Dean, one of the film's villains played very effectively by Dan Duryea, abducts a woman after killing her husband. The volatile cowboy toys with the tenderfoot husband, and dispatches him like a caricature of a cat toying with an insect before biting its head off. Waco Johnny Dean eventually gets what is coming to him after coming in contact with the ominous Winchester rifle.  The main story of Winchester '73 is reminiscent of the mythological tale of Jason and his quest for the golden fleece, as told in Apollonius' Argonautica. Both stories deal with the acquisition of a sacred object that possesses some sort of intangible quality. Like Jason, Stewart's character hops from one adventure to the next in search of a one-of-a- kind prize. Another theme in Winchester '73 that is similar to a mythic tale is the struggle between brothers. Several stories of antiquity deal with this issue, such as the Hebrew Bible's tale of Cain and Abel, and the vulgate tale of Romulus and Remus.  As for the theme of abduction and rape present in Anthony Mann's film, it is present in many mythological works, such as the rape of Europa as told by Ovid in his Metamorphoses.  Winchester '73 is a fine example of the western genre, and acts as the objective correlative for many classic American western and ancient mythological themes. Now, what is this review like? OPT: (a). negative. (b). positive.","output":"This review is (b) positive.

There was no other hiding-place possible, except beneath the bed, and the ruthless hand of the inspector had torn off the white muslin bed hangings, revealing emptiness underneath.  Rolfe went out into the hall again, and entered the room next the bedroom.  This apartment was apparently used as a dining-room, for it contained a large table, a few chairs, a small sideboard, a spirit-stand, a case of books and ornaments, and two small oak presses.  Plainly, there was no place in it where a man could hide himself.  The next room was the bathroom, which was also empty.  Opposite the bathroom was a small bedroom, very barely furnished, offering no possibility of concealment.  Then the passage opened into a large roomy kitchen, the full width of the rooms on both sides of the hall, and the kitchen completed the flat.

Here's a question: Betty felt that being in love was vital and important, necessary to do what?  Here are possible answers to this question: - propose to woman - kiss - propose to woman - live life - sing  I believe the correct choice is \\"live life\\", here's why: Answer:","output":"Live life Step 1: Analyze the question and possible answers. In this case, the question is asking what Betty felt was vital and important, and necessary to do when being in love. The possible answers given are: propose to woman, kiss, live life, and sing. Step 2: Eliminate irrelevant answers. \\"Propose to woman\\" is mentioned twice, which could be a mistake or an attempt to emphasize that option. However, proposing to a woman is not necessarily a universal feeling when being in love, as it is a specific action and not everyone in love may decide to propose. Step 3: Evaluate the remaining answers. \\"Kiss\\" is also a specific action that people in love might do, but it doesn't necessarily reflect the overall importance of being in love. \\"Sing\\" is another action that might be related to being in love, but again, it does not reflect the overall importance and effect of being in love on a person's life. \\"Live life\\" is a broader term that encompasses all aspects of a person's life and experiences.

Jaffar's passengers, Prince Matton and his sister, Princess Belle, have been deposed from their planet; they bring with them a treasure the Prince took along to fund his restoration.

Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"What does rain do to exposed soil?\\" with the following options:  - It decreases  - moves  - contamination  - protect them  - Damages it  - It expands  - Movement  - evaporation Answer:","output":"Rain plays a significant role in the process of erosion, particularly when it comes to exposed soil. Based on the two facts provided, we can infer the following about the effects of rain on exposed soil. Fact 1: Rain causes erosion. Erosion is a natural process where water, wind, or other agents wear away soil, rock, and other surface materials. Rain, being a key factor in erosion, contributes to the breaking down and moving of soil particles from one place to another. As rainfall hits the ground, it dislodges soil particles which are then carried away by the flow of water, either over the surface or through various channels in the soil. Fact 2: Sediment exposed soil is susceptible to erosion by wind and rain. Exposed soil is soil that is not protected by any form of vegetation or cover. Without any such protection, exposed soil is more vulnerable to the eroding forces of wind and rain. The lack of vegetation leaves the soil's surface loose and susceptible to being washed away by flowing water or blown away by wind. Given these two facts and the options provided, the most appropriate answer to the question \\"What does rain do to exposed soil?\\" would be: - Damages it Rain damages exposed soil by causing erosion, which dislodges and carries away soil particles. Due to the lack of protection from vegetation, the soil is more susceptible to rainfall and wind, resulting in a higher likelihood of erosion. Additionally, when soil particles are moved from one place to another, it can lead to the deterioration of the soil structure, resulting in negative consequences for plant growth, water infiltration, and soil fertility. In summary, rain damages exposed soil through the process of erosion, breaking down and moving soil particles, and leaving the land less stable and fertile. This not only affects the natural environment but also has far-reaching implications for agriculture, infrastructure, and ecosystems. Therefore, it is essential to implement proper soil conservation practices to minimize the harmful effects of erosion on exposed soil."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

PUBLISHED:. 19:37 EST, 16 January 2014. |. UPDATED:. 02:07 EST, 17 January 2014. A report has found that of the 1.8m single parent households in Britain, 650,000 of them are not in any sort of work. Posed by models. Britain has more single parents than almost any country in Europe, and almost one in three of them are unemployed. A report has found that of the 1.8million single parent households in Britain, 650,000 of them are not in any sort of work. This has led to a situation where the average single parent household in the UK claims twice as much in benefit support as the average two-parent household. The proportion of lone parent households in the UK is the fourth highest in the EU - behind only Estonia, Latvia and Ireland - with 24 per cent of of children being brought up by just one adult. The think tank Policy Exchange, which compiled the study, said the figures showed that if George Osborne wants to slash the welfare bill, he needs to target support at helping young, single parents find work. Author Matthew Tinsley said: ‘Raising a child is a huge responsibility regardless of your living arrangements. All parents - especially young single mothers - need support. ‘It is right that the government extended free childcare. However, it is also right to ask more from people to find a job. Simply relying on benefits when you are physically and mentally able to work is not fair. ‘Policymakers must do more to help the two thirds of a million unemployed single parents find a job. Such action would significantly boost the UK economy and help find further savings in the welfare budget.’ The report found that the level of unemployment among single partners can partly be attributed to when they had children. More than half (52 per cent) of lone mothers who had their first child as a teenager are not in work or looking for work, compared to 40 per cent who had their first aged 20 to 23. More than half (52 per cent) of lone mothers who had their first child as a teenager are not in work or looking for work, compared to 40 per cent who had their first aged 20 to 23.  Posed by models. Among those who have their first child in their early thirties, the unemployment rate is 19 per cent. However, there has been an increase in the number of single parents in work compared to the 1990s, partly due to employment support and stronger job search requirements introduced by the previous government, and the increase in part-time work. The most common age single parents had their first child is 20 compared to couples who are together who most often had their first child at 30. While the number of teenage pregnancies has fallen by a third between 1998 and 2011, the UK still has one of the highest rates in the developing world.

Former Long Beach Executive Director Toby Rothschild, now a policy wonk in Iwasaki's outfit, agreed. \\"To some extent, I did look at it and say, 'We are the littlest kid on the block, and we don't want to get beat up so we need a bigger protector,'\\" Rothschild said. \\"Once we got past that, it became a real positive for the Long Beach program and Long Beach clients.\\" But to the San Gabriel-Pomona Valley legal aid program, the positives of merging with Dudovitz's program, San Fernando Valley Neighborhood Legal Services, were never obvious. A meeting in late 1999 between Dudovitz and the San Gabriel-Pomona Valley program's board showed how little the two programs had in common and how difficult bridging the gap between their ideologies would be, Dudovitz recalled. Although no merger plans were discussed, board members at the smaller program knew of Dudovitz's preference for impact litigation over direct services. \\"We had a discussion about what our separate views were,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"The message we got was that they wanted their program to stay as it was.\\" Lauralea Saddick, former executive director of the San Gabriel-Pomona Valley program, said her board simply did not share Dudovitz's desire to spend money influencing social policy and participating in high-profile litigation over poverty-related issues. \\"Our board's philosophy was that the money given by the federal government was to help people with basic everyday needs,\\" Saddick said. \\"It might take a little bit of humility to take those kinds of cases. Impact work is very important ... but what was the good of getting the law changed if no one is there to help the individual?\\" Before the San Gabriel program was subsumed by Dudovitz's group, it offered to merge with the Legal Aid Society of Orange County. The boards of both organizations eschewed impact litigation in favor of the 1960s model of providing direct client services. Supported by resolutions from the Pasadena, San Gabriel, Eastern and Foothill bar associations, the two programs drew up plans to merge and submitted them to the Legal Services Corp. Dudovitz won Iwasaki's backing to oppose the deal, and Legal Services Corp., the national funding source, overruled the proposed San Gabriel-Pomona Valley/Orange County merger. On Jan. 27, 2001, the federal agency awarded the San Gabriel-Pomona Valley service area to Dudovitz under the umbrella of an expanded San Fernando program, citing the location of both programs in Los Angeles, which would allow \\"better coordinated and more effective advocacy on county government policies.\\" The San Gabriel-Pomona Valley program sued Legal Services Corp. to stop the takeover, claiming the federal program based the decision on favoritism for the politically active Dudovitz and the politically powerful Iwasaki.

Summarize this article: CONAKRY, Guinea (AP) — Health workers in protective hazmat suits treated patients in quarantine centers on Tuesday in a remote corner of Guinea where Ebola has killed at least 60 people in West Africa's first outbreak of the deadly virus in two decades.      FILE -In this Saturday, Sept. 29, 2007, file photo, A 43 year old Congolese patient, center, who has been confirmed to have Ebola hemorrhagic fever, following laboratory tests, is comforted by Medecins... (Associated Press)      Seven patients are being hospitalized at one isolation ward in Gueckedou in southern Guinea, while two others are being treated elsewhere, said Doctors Without Borders. The aid group said it is sending mobile teams into the surrounding countryside in search of people who may have been exposed since the first cases emerged last week.      \\"To confine the epidemic, it is critical to trace the entire transmission chain,\\" said Dr. Esther Sterk, a tropical medicine adviser for the medical group. \\"All individuals who have had contact with patients who may be contaminated are monitored and isolated at the first sign of infection.\\"      Six of the seven blood samples sent to France from Guinea had tested positive for Ebola, specifically the Zaire strain of the disease originating from Congo which has up to a 90 percent fatality rate, the World Health Organization said Tuesday.      Ebola has no vaccine or specific treatment. Its initial symptoms — high fever, weakness and headache — can mimic malaria, a much more common disease in West Africa. Once the virus has caused hemorrhaging, though, victims can start vomiting blood or bleeding from their nose and gums.      Some 1,500 of the 2,220 cases recorded since the virus was first discovered in 1976 have been fatal, experts say. So far the fatality rate in Guinea has been 70 percent, according to Dr. Sakoba Keita, a spokesman with the health ministry.      Those grim statistics are fueling fear amid the first outbreak in this part of West Africa in 20 years. So far at least 60 people have died in Guinea, a desperately poor country with limited health facilities, Keita said.      The outbreak has raised alarm in neighboring countries. Across the border in Liberia, officials are already investigating eight cases — including five deaths — suspected of having links to the Guinea cases. Those patients traveled across the border into Liberia in search of medical treatment, health officials said there.      Authorities in Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast say they are closely monitoring along their borders for possible cases.      The last case reported in West Africa was in Ivory Coast back in 1994. More recent outbreaks have emerged in Congo and Uganda.      It is unclear why the virus has now emerged in Guinea though Dr. Armand Sprecher, a public health specialist with Doctors Without Borders, said the virus is carried by bats in the region.      \\"It comes out of its reservoir when people eat bats or when bats share a tree with chimps or gorillas who are eating fruit,\\" he explained. \\"The chimps and gorillas become sick and become easy targets for bush meat hunters.\\"      Grieving relatives also can contract the virus when they come into contact with the bodies of victims during communal funerals, health officials say. Other victims have included health workers who treated the patients before the Ebola outbreak was identified.      ___      Larson reported from Dakar, Senegal. Associated Press writer Jonathan Paye-Layleh in Monrovia, Liberia also contributed to this report. ||||| Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Fruit bats are believed to be a major carrier of the Ebola virus but do not show symptoms      Guinea has banned the sale and consumption of bats to prevent the spread of the deadly Ebola virus, its health minister has said.      Bats, a local delicacy, appeared to be the \\"main agents\\" for the Ebola outbreak in the south, Rene Lamah said.      Sixty-two people have now been killed by the virus in Guinea, with suspected cases reported in neighbouring Liberia and Sierra Leone.      Ebola is spread by close contact. There is no known cure or vaccine.      It kills between 25% and 90% of victims, depending on the strain of the virus, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).      This is the first time such a national health threat has come to our borders Brima Kargbo, Sierra Leone health official      Symptoms include internal and external bleeding, diarrhoea and vomiting.      'Quarantine sites'      It is the first time Ebola has struck Guinea, with recent outbreaks thousands of miles away, in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo.      Mr Lamah announced the ban on the sale and consumption of bats during a tour of Forest Region, the epicentre of the epidemic, reports the BBC's Alhassan Sillah from the capital, Conakry.      People who eat the animals often boil them into a sort of spicy pepper soup, our correspondent says. The soup is sold in village stores where people gather to drink alcohol.      Other ways of preparing the bats to eat include drying them over a fire.      Image copyright AFP Image caption There is no known cure or vaccine for Ebola      Image copyright Reuters Image caption Aid agencies and the government are taking medical supplies to the affected areas in Guinea      Certain species of bat found in West and Central Africa are thought to be the natural reservoir of Ebola, although they do not show any symptoms.      Health officials reported one more death on Tuesday, bringing the number of people killed by Ebola to 62, our correspondent adds.      The charity Medecins Sans Frontieres has set up two quarantine sites in southern Guinea to try to contain the outbreak, the Associated Press news agency reports.      Health authorities are receiving help from the WHO while messages are being broadcast on national television to reassure people.      Sierra Leone's health ministry said it was investigating two suspected cases of Ebola.      \\"We still do not have any confirmed cases of Ebola in the country,\\" its chief medical officer Brima Kargbo told AFP.

Mr Kargbo said one suspected case involved a 14-year-old boy buried in a Sierra Leonean village after he apparently died across the border in Guinea two weeks ago, AFP reports.      The other patient was still alive in the northern border district of Kambia, he added.      Five people are reported to have died in Liberia after crossing from southern Guinea for treatment, Liberia's Health Minister Walter Gwenigale told journalists on Monday.

What is the middle name of the musician that American jazz guitarist, vocalist, and songwriter Joyce Cooling has preformed with who has the first and last initials \\"A\\" and \\"J\\" respectively? A:","output":"Alright, let's break this down step by step. Step 1: Identify the musician with initials \\"A\\" and \\"J\\" that Joyce Cooling has performed with. - I will research and look for collaborations between Joyce Cooling and other musicians, focusing on those with the initials \\"A\\" and \\"J.\\" Step 2: Find the middle name of the identified musician. - After having identified the musician, I will look for their full name, including their middle name. Upon researching, I found that Joyce Cooling has performed with Al Jarreau, an American jazz singer. Therefore, \\"A\\" stands for Al and \\"J\\" for Jarreau. Now, let's move on to step 2. I've found that Al Jarreau's full name is Alwin Lopez Jarreau. Therefore, the middle name of the musician that American jazz guitarist, vocalist, and songwriter Joyce Cooling has performed with, whose initials are \\"A\\" and \\"J,\\" is Lopez."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - expect to die - pay bills - buy pets - stay in - eat corn A:","output":"Since we aren't immortal, people should expect to die. This option is the most suitable answer to the question because it directly addresses the human condition of mortality. Although the other options have their own merits and relevance in various contexts, they don't specifically respond to the question's focus on our lack of immortality. It is important for individuals to acknowledge and accept the inevitability of death, as it allows them to prioritize their values, make the most out of their time, and develop a healthy attitude towards the impermanence of life. Recognizing that one day we will die helps us better appreciate the time we have and make choices that align with our values and aspirations. Some ways to foster this awareness and acceptance of mortality include engaging in open conversations about death, considering end-of-life care preferences, and reflecting on the legacies we hope to leave behind. In addition, embracing the reality of death can inspire us to take care of ourselves mentally, emotionally, and physically, so that we can lead fulfilling lives and ensure that we have no regrets in the end. Although paying bills, buying pets, staying in, and eating corn can have meaningful and practical implications in different life situations, they don't inherently address the issue of our mortality. Paying bills is a necessary aspect of being financially responsible, while owning pets can provide companionship and positively impact mental health. Staying in reflects the need for relaxation and self-care, and eating corn may contribute to a well-balanced diet, but none of these options specifically tackle the acceptance of the fact that we are not immortal. In summary, given the options provided and the focus of the question on our lack of immortality, the most suitable response is that people should expect to die. This perspective promotes a healthy mindset, encouraging individuals to make the most of their time and prioritize their well-being and personal values. While the other choices may have merits in different contexts, none of them inherently address the issue of human mortality as directly as expecting to die."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

My parents and I watched together \\"C'eravamo tanto amati\\" on a summer night: we liked it, but we didn't love it as we loved \\"A special day\\". I believe Ettore Scola is pretty underrated: we often forget to remember him, maybe because his latest films were disappointing. And so, yesterday night, my mum and I sat on our sofa to enjoy this masterpiece. Writing, direction, cinematography, score and production design were sober and accurate, but the thing I liked the most was the chemistry between Loren and Mastroianni. They're both excellent actors and play the main roles of Antonietta and Gabriele. Antonietta is an housewife: married with a fanatic Fascist, she has six children but her husband wants to have another child to get a prize for the huge families. Gabriele is simply an Anti-Fascist. They spend together a special day, that special day of 1938 when Hitler came to Rome visiting Mussolini. I don't want to spoil anymore about the plot: go looking for this film! How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","output":"This review sounds happy and excited about the movie \\"A Special Day.\\" The person really enjoyed the movie and thought everything was well-done, especially the acting by the main actors.

The Vikes got off to a fast start as Blair Walsh nailed a 54-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead followed up by Matt Cassel hooking up with Greg Jennings on a 70-yard touchdown pass for a 10-0 lead.  The Steelers managed to get on the board later on in the first quarter when rookie RB Le'Von Bell ran for an 8-yard touchdown to make the game 10-7.  The Vikes moved ahead by double digits in the second quarter as Adrian Peterson ran for a 60-yard touchdown for a 17-7 lead.  Shaun Suisham got the Steelers within a touchdown by nailing a 26-yard field goal for a 17-10 lead.  Walsh moved the Vikes ahead by 10 at halftime by kicking a 37-yard field goal for a 20-10 lead.  The Steelers came within 3 as Le'Von Bell ran for a 1-yard touchdown shortening the lead to 20-17 but the Vikes managed to move ahead 27-17 after Peterson ran for a 7-yard touchdown and then Cassel found Jennings again on a 16-yard touchdown pass to make the lead 34-17.  In the 4th quarter, Jerricho Cotchery hooked up with Ben Roethlisberger on a 15-yard touchdown pass for a 34-24 lead, and then tried to rally as Suisham nailed a 28-yard field goal.  The Steelers' comeback attempt was ruined again as Roethlisberger was sacked and fumbled the ball with less than a minute left in the game sealing the victory for the Vikes. With this loss, the Steelers are off to their worst start since the AFL-NFL merger. They had last started 0-4 in 1968, when they started 0-6.  This is also the first time since 2006 in which the team would fall to 4 games below .500 when they started that season 2-6. Answer this question: How many yards more was the longest passing touchdown over the longest rushing touchdown?","output":"In the game described, the longest passing touchdown was a 70-yard pass from Matt Cassel to Greg Jennings. The longest rushing touchdown was a 60-yard run by Adrian Peterson. To find the difference in yards between the two touchdowns, subtract the yardage of the longest rushing touchdown from the yardage of the longest passing touchdown: 70 yards (longest passing touchdown) - 60 yards (longest rushing touchdown) = 10 yards So, the longest passing touchdown was 10 yards longer than the longest rushing touchdown."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question 1: Why does Photoshop support only Zawgyi-One font for Myanmar but not Unicode? Question 2: How do I install fonts in Photoshop CS5 for Mac? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"The answers to these two questions are not the same, as the first question is about the support of specific font types for Myanmar in Photoshop, while the second question is about the process of installing fonts in Photoshop CS5 for Mac. Let me answer them separately: Question 1: The reason behind Photoshop supporting only Zawgyi-One font for Myanmar but not Unicode might be due to compatibility and historical issues. When Zawgyi-One was created, it became a popular font in Myanmar before Unicode was widely adopted. As a result, many older applications, including Adobe Photoshop, might have added support for Zawgyi-One. However, newer versions of Adobe Photoshop should support Unicode Myanmar fonts. If you are still using an older version of Photoshop, consider updating to the latest version or finding alternative Myanmar Unicode fonts that may be compatible with your version. Question 2: To install fonts in Photoshop CS5 for Mac, follow these step-by-step instructions: Step 1: Download the font you want to install onto your Mac. Font files typically come in .otf or .ttf formats. Step 2: Locate the downloaded font file, which may be in your \\"Downloads\\" folder or another location specified during download. Step 3: Double-click the font file to open the Font Preview window. In this window, you'll see a preview of the font and some information about it. Step 4: Click the \\"Install Font\\" button at the bottom of the Font Preview window. This will install the font on your Mac. Step 5: Close any open Adobe Photoshop instances and restart the application. Upon reopening Photoshop CS5, the newly installed font should now be available in the font selection menu. In summary, the answers to the two questions are not the same. The first question addresses the support of specific Myanmar fonts, while the second question provides a guide on installing fonts in Photoshop CS5 for Mac."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, everything changes on the day of his wedding anniversary, when he discovers his wife Brooke is cheating on him with the poolman, Matt. After they finish, Alan retrieves his pistol and follows Matt in his car. He is led to Paula Roberts's house, a friend of Brooke's. Alan invents a story about a surprise party for Brooke and watches Paula invite Matt inside. Paula's dog attacks Alan, and he shoots it in self-defense. After returning to his car, he drives to work. At his dental practice, Alan's first appointment goes poorly when he hallucinates a child has rotten teeth and accidentally stabs him. As Detective Gibbs investigates the death of Paula's dog, Alan sees his second patient, April Reign, a beauty queen. Alan hallucinates she is his wife, and, while she is unconscious, takes off her pantyhose and fondles her before choking her. As she wakes, Alan snaps out of it and hides her pantyhose. Alan tells his manager, Steve Landers, she is still dizzy from nitrous oxide. When Steve realizes what really happened, he returns, punches Alan, and threatens a lawsuit. Alan ends the day early and sends his staff and patients home, including Sarah, a teenager who wants to have her braces removed. Later that night, Brooke meets Alan at a new opera-themed room at his practice. After sedating her under the premise of cleaning her teeth, he pulls out her teeth and cuts off her tongue. Detective Gibbs and his partner Detective Sunshine arrive at Alan's house the next morning to ask him questions. After the policemen leave, Matt discovers Brooke, who is still alive but sedated.

Melting snow provides water for rivers, electric power stations and agricultural crops. In the western United States, mountain snow provides up to seventy-five percent of all surface water supplies. Snowfall helps to protect plants and some wild animals from winter weather. Fresh snow is made largely of air trapped among the snow crystals  . Because the air has trouble moving, the movement of heat is limited. Snow also influences the movement of sound waves. The surface of the snow takes in, or absorbs, sound waves. As snow grows older or if there have been strong winds, it can become hard and flat. Then, the snow,s surface will help to send back sound waves. Snow may be beautiful, but it can be deadly. It is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of people. Many people die in traffic accidents on roads covered with snow and ice or from being seriously stuck in the winter storm. Others die from heart attacks caused by too much physical activity out in the cold. People may not be able to avoid living in areas where it snows often. However, they can avoid becoming victims of snowstorms. People should stop driving and stay at home until the storm has passed. People living in these areas should carry emergency supplies in their vehicle. These include food,emergency medical supplies,and extra clothing to stay warm and dry. Question: Snow protects plants and wild animals from cold weather by   _  .

The high-end beans, such as Kona or Blue Mountain, are known to cost extraordinary sums of money. Then there is Kopi Lowak (translated as \\"Civet Coffee\\"), the world's most expensive coffee, which sells for as much as US 50 per quarter-pound. This isn't particularly surprising, because approximately 500 pounds a year of Kopi Lowak make up the entire world supply. What is surprising is why this particular coffee is so rare. In fact, it's not the plants that are rare. It's the civet droppings. That's right, the civet droppings--the body waste of the palm civet. Coffee beans aren't Kopi Lowak until they've been digested  and come out in the body waste of the palm civet. Palm civets are tree-dwelling, raccoon-like little animals, native to Southeast Asia and the Indonesian islands. They also have a love for coffee cherries. According to Kopi Lowak suppliers, palm civets eat the fruit whole, but only digest the outer fruit, leaving the beans intact . While the beans are not destroyed, they undergo a transformation in the animal's body. A chemical substance in the digestive system of the palm civet causes some changes to the beans to give them a unique flavor . However, this is not the only explanation why coffee beans retrieved from civet droppings have a special flavor all their own. Another possible reason is that palm civets have an unfailing instinct for picking the coffee cherries at the peak of their ripeness. Kopi Lowak is reported to have a character in taste unlike any other coffee, complex with caramel undertones and an earthy flavor. Currently, most of the world's supply of Kopi Lowak is sold in Japan, though a few US markets are also starting to stock up on Kopi Lowak. Which of the following statements is true, according to the passage? A) Little palm civets eat only the outer layer of the coffee cherries. B) Palm civets somehow know the right time when the coffee fruit ripens. C) Kopi Lowak is most popular in Southeast Asia and the Indonesian islands. D) Kona and Blue Mountain are the most expensive coffees but only of average quality. The answer is:","output":"B) Palm civets somehow know the right time when the coffee fruit ripens."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Wayne Bronner, Wally's son, is president and CEO of what is now a multi-million dollar corporation. He learned the business from an early age. Some of his best memories are traveling to other countries with his father to find new products for the store. Bronner's sells more than 50,000 holiday products from 70 nations. Half of the products cost less than ten dollars. Wayne Bronner says the demand for small objects to hang on Christmas trees has expanded over the years. People spend more time, effort and money into decorating their homes with these ornaments, lights and religious scenes. Bronner's is famous for its nativity scenes which show the birth of Jesus Christ. Michigan has the nation's highest unemployment rate. Bronner's has been affected by the recession, too.

Given the fact \\"living things all require energy for survival\\", what is the answer to the question or completion \\"What requires energy for survival?\\"","output":"The answer to the question \\"What requires energy for survival?\\" is all living organisms or living things. Living organisms include a diverse range of species, from microorganisms and single-celled organisms like bacteria and protozoa, to multicellular organisms such as plants, animals, and fungi. Each of these living organisms has unique characteristics but shares a common requirement for energy to ensure their survival, growth, development, and reproduction. Energy is vital for all biological processes that occur within living organisms. Some essential functions for which energy is mandatory include: 1. Cellular metabolism: Cells, which are the basic units of life, undergo various metabolic reactions to synthesize or break down compounds needed for their survival. These reactions require an input of energy, derived generally from the breakdown of glucose and other organic molecules. 2. Physical movement: Energy is needed for mechanical work such as muscle contraction, allowing movement and locomotion in animals and ensuring that they can hunt or escape from predators, reproduce, and interact with their environment. 3. Active transport: Cells require energy to transport vital substances such as nutrients, waste materials, and ions across their membranes. This exchange is crucial for maintaining cellular equilibrium and ensuring access to essential elements that support various cellular processes. 4. Growth and development: Organisms require energy for the synthesis of biomolecules, cell replication, and differentiation, ensuring growth, maturity, and the formation of specialized structures. 5. Reproduction: The formation and distribution of genetic material within new cells or offspring necessitate energy. It ensures that genetic information is passed on from one generation to the next, maintaining the continuity of life. 6. Homeostasis: Maintenance of internal bodily conditions at an optimal level, like consistent body temperature and pH balance in animals or osmotic balance in plants, requires energy. Homeostasis facilitates the proper functioning of cellular processes, preventing damage to an organism's internal environment. 7. Response to stimuli: Living organisms have the ability to perceive changes in their environment and react accordingly. This response to stimuli helps in adaptations and survival and necessitates energy for proper signal transmission and communication within cells. 8. Defense and repair: Organisms require energy to repair damaged cells or tissues, to initiate mechanisms that protect against pathogens or harmful environmental factors, and to maintain a robust immune system. In conclusion, living organisms, be it plants, animals, or microorganisms, all require energy for their survival, ensuring that their cells function effectively and maintaining the perpetuation of life. This energy is obtained primarily through the consumption of food, sunlight (in the case of photosynthetic organisms), or through chemosynthetic processes (for a certain group of bacteria)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Then he pointed his telescope to planet Jupiter, which is farther form the Sun than Mars is. He noted it as case C. Finally, he pointed the telescope to a faraway planet called WASP-17b. He noted that as case B.  Which case would see clockwise movement, case A or case B?  Hint: According to current definitions, all planets must revolve around stars; thus, any potential \\"rogue planets\\" are excluded. In the Solar System, all the planets orbit the Sun in the same direction as the Sun rotates (counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole). At least one extrasolar planet, WASP-17b, has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star's rotation. The period of one revolution of a planet's orbit is known as its sidereal period or year. A planet's year depends on its distance from its star; the farther a planet is from its star, not only the longer the distance it must travel, but also the slower its speed, because it is less affected by its star's gravity. No planet's orbit is perfectly circular, and hence the distance of each varies over the course of its year. The closest approach to its star is called its periastron (perihelion in the Solar System), whereas its farthest separation from the star is called its apastron (aphelion). As a planet approaches periastron, its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy, just as a falling object on Earth accelerates as it falls; as the planet reaches apastron, its speed decreases, just as an object thrown upwards on Earth slows down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory.Each planet's orbit is delineated by a set of elements: The answer to this question is:","output":"Case B.

Its territory covers , making it the 41st largest country in the world.  - The Kunar River (Urdu,), also called the Chitral River or the Kama River, is about 480 km long, located in northern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, and eastern Afghanistan. The river system is fed by melting glaciers and snow of the Hindu Kush mountains. It is also part of the Indus watershed basin.  - Durrani or Abdali is the name of a prominent Sarbani Pashtun tribal confederation in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Originally known by their ancient name \\"Abdali\\", which may derive from the more ancient \\"Ebodalo\\" (Bactrian: \\"\\" / \\"Hephthalites\\"). They have been called \\"Durrani\\" since the beginning of the Durrani Empire in 1747. The number of Durrani is estimated to be roughly 16% of the population of Afghanistan or 5 million individuals. Durrani are found throughout Afghanistan and Pakistan; although large concentrations are found in southern Afghanistan, they are also found to a lesser extent in east, west and central Afghanistan. Many Durranis are found in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab provinces of Pakistan. The Durrani Pashtuns of the Afghan capital Kabul are usually bilingual in Pashto and Dari Persian. The ruling Sadozai and Barakzai dynasties of Afghanistan were originally from the Durrani.  - Pakistan (or ), officially the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, is a federal parliamentary republic in South Asia on crossroads of Central Asia and Western Asia. It is the sixth-most populous country with a population exceeding 200 million people. It is the 36th largest country in the world in terms of area with an area covering . Pakistan has a coastline along the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Oman in the south and is bordered by India to the east, Afghanistan to the west, Iran to the southwest and China in the far northeast respectively. It is separated from Tajikistan by Afghanistan's narrow Wakhan Corridor in the north, and also shares a maritime border with Oman.  - Atrial fibrillation (AF or A-fib) is an abnormal heart rhythm characterized by rapid and irregular beating. Often it starts as brief periods of abnormal beating which become longer and possibly constant over time. Most episodes have no symptoms. Occasionally there may be heart palpitations, fainting, lightheadedness, shortness of breath, or chest pain. The disease is associated with an increased risk of heart failure, dementia, and stroke. It is a type of supraventricular tachycardia. High blood pressure and valvular heart disease are the most common alterable risk factors for AF. Other heart-related risk factors include heart failure, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, and congenital heart disease. In the developing world valvular heart disease often occurs as a result of rheumatic fever. Lung-related risk factors include COPD, obesity, and sleep apnea. Other factors include excess alcohol intake, diabetes mellitus, and thyrotoxicosis. However, half of cases are not associated with one of these risks. A diagnosis is made by feeling the pulse and may be confirmed using an electrocardiogram (ECG). A typical ECG in AF shows no P waves and an irregular ventricular rate. AF is often treated with medications to slow the heart rate to a near normal range (known as rate control) or to convert the rhythm to normal sinus rhythm (known as rhythm control). Electrical cardioversion can also be used to convert AF to a normal sinus rhythm and is often used emergently if the person is unstable. Ablation may prevent recurrence in some people. Depending on the risk of stroke either aspirin or anti-clotting medications such as warfarin or a novel oral anticoagulant may be recommended. While these medications reduce this risk, they increase rates of major bleeding. Atrial fibrillation is the most common serious abnormal heart rhythm. In Europe and North America, as of 2014, it affects about 2% to 3% of the population. This is an increase from 0.4 to 1% of the population around 2005. In the developing world about 0.6% of...  - Afghan (Pashto also Persian: ; see \\"etymology\\") refers to someone or something from Afghanistan, in particular a citizen of that country. Prior to the rise of the nation as Afghanistan, it was used by Persian speakers and those influenced by the Persian language to denote the Pashtun people. In modern times, \\"Afghan\\" is rarely used as an ethnic term for the Pashtuns, but is rather used as the national demonym for all citizens of Afghanistan  Pashtuns, Tajiks, and also a large number of Hazaras, Uzbeks, Aimaqs, Turkmens, Balochs, Nuristanis, Pashayis, Pamiris, Arabs, and others. According to the \\"Encyclopædia Iranica\\", the word Afghan (afn) in current political usage means any citizen of Afghanistan, regardless of their tribal or religious affiliation. According to the 1964 Constitution of Afghanistan, all Afghans are equal in rights and obligations before the law. The fourth article of the current Constitution of Afghanistan states that citizens of Afghanistan consist of Pashtuns, Tajiks, Hazara, Uzbek, Turkmen, Aymaq, Arab, Baluch, Pashayi, Nuristani, Qezelbash, Gujjars, Brahui, and members of other tribes.  - Faisal Ahmad Shinwari ( or Fazal Hadi Shinwari ) ( 1927 -- February 21 , 2011 ) was the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Afghanistan from 2001 until 2006 . He was appointed to the post by Afghan President Hamid Karzai in accordance with the Afghan Constitution approved after the 2001 overthrow of the Taliban government . An ethnic Pashtun from Jalalabad , Afghanistan , Shinwari died in February 2011 from stroke , he was a member of the Ittehad - al - Islami party .  - Tajikistan (, or ), officially the Republic of Tajikistan (\\"Çumhuriji Toçikiston\\"), is a mountainous, landlocked country in Central Asia with an estimated 8 million people in 2013, and an area of . It is bordered by Afghanistan to the south, Uzbekistan to the west, Kyrgyzstan to the north, and China to the east. Pakistan lies to the south, separated by the narrow Wakhan Corridor. Traditional homelands of Tajik people included present-day Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Uzbekistan.  - Stroke is when poor blood flow to the brain results in cell death. There are two main types of stroke: ischemic, due to lack of blood flow, and hemorrhagic, due to bleeding. They result in part of the brain not functioning properly. Signs and symptoms of a stroke may include an inability to move or feel on one side of the body, problems understanding or speaking, feeling like the world is spinning, or loss of vision to one side. Signs and symptoms often appear soon after the stroke has occurred. If symptoms last less than one or two hours it is known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or mini-stroke. A hemorrhagic stroke may also be associated with a severe headache. The symptoms of a stroke can be permanent. Long-term complications may include pneumonia or loss of bladder control. The main risk factor for stroke is high blood pressure. Other risk factors include tobacco smoking, obesity, high blood cholesterol, diabetes mellitus, previous TIA, and atrial fibrillation. An ischemic stroke is typically caused by blockage of a blood vessel, though there are also less common causes. A hemorrhagic stroke is caused by either bleeding directly into the brain or into the space between the brain's membranes. Bleeding may occur due to a ruptured brain aneurysm. Diagnosis is typically with medical imaging such as a CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan along with a physical exam. Other tests such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood tests are done to determine risk factors and rule out other possible causes. Low blood sugar may cause similar symptoms. Prevention includes decreasing risk factors, as well as possibly aspirin, statins, surgery to open up the arteries to the brain in those with problematic narrowing, and warfarin in those with atrial fibrillation. A stroke or TIA often requires emergency care. An ischemic stroke, if detected within three to four and half hours, may be treatable with a medication that can break down the clot. Aspirin should be used. Some hemorrhagic strokes benefit from...  - The blood vessels are the part of the circulatory system that transports blood throughout the human body. There are three major types of blood vessels: the arteries, which carry the blood away from the heart; the capillaries, which enable the actual exchange of water and chemicals between the blood and the tissues; and the veins, which carry blood from the capillaries back toward the heart. The word \\"vascular\\", meaning relating to the blood vessels, is derived from the Latin \\"vas\\", meaning vessel. A few structures (such as cartilage and the lens of the eye) do not contain blood vessels and are labeled.  - Hamid Karzai (Pashto/Persian:  ; born 24 December 1957) served as President of Afghanistan for almost ten years, from 7 December 2004 to 29 September 2014. He comes from a politically active family; Karzai's father, uncle and grandfather were all active in Afghan politics and government. Karzai and his father before him, Abdul Ahad Karzai, were each head of the Popalzai tribe of the Durrani tribal confederation.  - Central Asia or Middle Asia is the core region of the Asian continent and stretches from the Caspian Sea in the west to China in the east and from Afghanistan in the south to Russia in the north. It is also colloquially referred to as \\"the 'stans\\" (as the six countries generally considered to be within the region all have names ending with the Persian suffix \\"-stan\\", meaning \\"land of\\") and is within the scope of the wider Eurasian continent.  - Pashto (; \\"Paxt\\" ), also known in older literature as Afghn or Pahn, is the South-Central Asian language of the Pashtuns.

Eventually, he was able to categorize them in three different groups, group A, group B, and group C. He placed the animals that can only hear ifrasound in group A. Then he placed the animals that are only able to hear the same frequency of sound waves as humans do in group B. The last group of animals were able to hear only ultrasound. He placed them in group C.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which group would be able to hear lower frequency, group A or group B?  Hint: The frequency of sound waves is measured in hertz (Hz), or the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a second. Human beings can normally hear sounds with a frequency between about 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. Sounds with frequencies below 20 hertz are called infrasound . Sounds with frequencies above 20,000 hertz are called ultrasound . Some other animals can hear sounds in the ultrasound range. For example, dogs can hear sounds with frequencies as high as 50,000 Hz. You may have seen special whistles that dogs but not people can hear. The whistles produce a sound with a frequency too high for the human ear to detect. Other animals can hear even higher-frequency sounds. Bats, for example, can hear sounds with frequencies higher than 100,000 Hz.

What is the answer: \\"The \\"\\"Coulomb\\"\\" is the SI Unit of what?\\"","output":"The \\"Coulomb\\" is the SI (International System of Units) unit of electric charge. In the field of physics and electrical engineering, electric charge is a fundamental property of matter that gives rise to one of the four fundamental forces of nature – the electromagnetic force. The Coulomb is named in honor of the French physicist Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, who made significant contributions to the field of electromagnetism through his detailed research and experiments. A Coulomb, abbreviated as \\"C,\\" represents the quantity of electric charge that passes through a given point in an electric circuit within one second when the electric current in the circuit is one ampere. One Coulomb is numerically equivalent to 6.242 × 10^18 elementary charges, which is approximately the charge of 6.242 × 10^18 electrons or protons. The elementary charge, denoted by \\"e,\\" is the smallest possible electric charge that can exist in a free form and represents the charge of a single electron (which is -1e) or proton (which is +1e). Understanding the concept of electric charge and the Coulomb as its unit is crucial in describing the behavior and interactions of charged particles, as well as in the analysis and design of electrical circuits. In electrical circuits, the flow of electric charges causes what we commonly call \\"electric current.\\" The electric current is measured in amperes (A), and it indicates the number of Coulombs (units of electric charge) flowing through a particular point or section of the circuit per second. To put it in perspective, electric charges (measured in Coulombs) are the building blocks of electrical phenomena, while electric current (measured in amperes) is the rate at which these electric charges flow through a conductor or a circuit. In addition to being foundational to electromagnetism, electric charge and the electromagnetic force play a significant role in chemistry, biology, electronics, and communication technology. In summary, the \\"Coulomb\\" is the SI unit of electric charge, which is a fundamental property of matter associated with the electromagnetic force. A Coulomb represents the amount of electric charge that passes through a point in an electric circuit within one second when the electric current is one ampere. The concept of electric charge, along with the Coulomb as its unit, is vital in understanding various electrical phenomena, including the behavior of charged particles and the working of electrical circuits."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the weather changes happens, how will it affect MORE waste being removed from the body.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The weather change can have an indirect effect on the waste removal process in the body. When the weather is hot or temperatures rise, the body tends to lose more water through sweating to maintain its temperature. As a result, a person may become dehydrated if they do not consume enough fluids. Dehydration can lead to a decrease in urine production, as the body conserves water. Consequently, less waste may be removed from the body through urine. On the other hand, if a person drinks more water during weather changes to stay hydrated, it may lead to an increase in urine production. This can eventually result in more waste being removed from the body as more waste products will be filtered out by the kidneys, combined with water to make urine, and excreted through the urinary system. In summary, the perturbation of weather changes can indirectly affect the waste removal process in the body, but this depends on an individual's water intake and overall hydration levels."},{"instruction":"Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.

This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

Peyton Manning is Sports Illustrated's Sportsman of the Year. Mr Manning has led Denver to an 11-3 record this year, his second with the Broncos after missing the 2011 season with Indianapolis because of neck troubles that affected his right triceps. He has thrown 47 touchdown passes, three shy of Patriots quarterbackTom Brady's NFL season record set in 2007, and he has two games remaining. Man of the hour: Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning (18) passes Thursday night in the third quarter against the San Diego Chargers. Mr Manning last year won the NFL's Comeback Player of the Year Award after returning from multiple neck surgeries that many feared would end his career. The Denver Broncos star spent 14 years. with the Indianapolis Colts before being released after sitting out the. 2011 season while rehabbing from the surgeries. Huge honor: Mr Manning is the fourth quarterback in the last nine years to win the honor. 'I have no idea who wants me, what team wants me, how this process works,' he said between tears at the press conference announcing the end of his time with the Colts. The veteran was already a first-ballot hall of famer at the time, but his 2013 season puts him on par with the all-time greats who have ever played the game. 'When great competitors get scorned, they come back with a vengeance,' former Broncos quarterback and current Executive Vice President of Football Operations John Elway told Sports Illustrated. 'We signed a Hall of Famer with a chip on his shoulder' That uncertainty must have motivated him, because he's having the greatest season by a quarterback in the 97 year history of the NFL - he's poised to break both the single-season touchdown and passing yards records. He has also guided his team to the top seed in the AFC playoffs - all at the age of 37.

Plot title: City Heat Movie plot: In Kansas City, 1933, near the end of Prohibition,[1] a police lieutenant known by his last name, Speer (Eastwood), is acquainted with a former cop turned private eye named Mike Murphy (Reynolds). Speer and Murphy were once good friends, which changed after Murphy left the force.[1] On a rainy night, Speer comes to a diner for coffee. Two goons arrive, looking for Murphy. They pounce the minute Murphy arrives, starting a fistfight. Speer, no fan of Murphy's, ignores the fight until a goon causes him to spill his coffee. Both goons are thrown through the front door. Murphy sarcastically thanks Speer for saving his life. The two rivals have eyes for Murphy's secretary Addy (Jane Alexander). She loves both and proves it when, after tenderly kissing Murphy goodbye, goes on a date with Speer. Murphy does have a new romantic interest, a rich socialite named Caroline Howley (Madeline Kahn), but finds himself unable to commit. Speer and Addy go to a boxing match at which the mob boss Primo Pitt (Rip Torn) is present. Murphy's partner Dehl Swift (Richard Roundtree) is also there, and seems to be in cahoots with Pitt and his gang. Swift is in possession of a briefcase whose contents, secret accounting records of rival gang boss Leon Coll's operations, are the target of both Pitt's and Coll's gangs. Swift, tailed by Speer and Addy, is confronted by Pitt's thugs at his apartment with Ginny Lee (Irene Cara) taken hostage. Ginny Lee manages to escape but Swift is shot and killed during a struggle with Pitt.[1] A thug opens the briefcase but there's nothing inside. He picks up Swift's body and throws it out the window, where it lands on the roof of Speer's parked car (which is occupied by the horrified Addy, who waits after Speer goes to investigate in the apartment). Murphy vows revenge on Pitt for killing his partner. He asks Speer for assistance and they form a reluctant alliance.

Write a title for this article: Buried in the earth below Colorado, Utah and Wyoming sit shale rock formations estimated to contain 800 billion barrels of oil, or half the world's proven reserves. To develop it, the U.S. government has granted mining concessions to three entities: Royal Dutch Shell (nyse: RDSA - news - people ), Chevron (nyse: CVX - news - people ) and Howard Jonas. Jonas, you may recall, was the entrepreneurial fellow behind IDT (nyse: IDT - news - people ), the widely advertised Newark, N.J. company that once dominated the overseas calling card market. As recently as 2004 IDT was worth 1.4 billion, though today its market capitalization has shrunk to 136 million, of which Jonas owns 47%. Jonas, 52, is trying to reinvigorate IDT's existing business lines, but he thinks the shale scheme could be his really big payoff. He figures it'll cost 40 to extract a barrel of oil from the shale and he'll be able to sell it for well over 100. Multiply that difference by his company's access to 5 billion barrels, and you've got 300 billion in profit. (\\"Which should help the stock,\\" he points out.) Alas, the technology to extract oil from shale for only 40 a barrel isn't there yet. But, he says, give him until 2015 and he'll figure it out. Jonas, an orthodox Jew with a truck driver's vocabulary, has been a visionary and an iconoclast ever since he started selling hot dogs outside a methadone clinic in his native Bronx 40 years ago--and wrote a book about it, On a Roll . He hit it big when he conceived the idea of arbitraging international phone rates, with a service that let callers from outside the United States connect to the U.S. over cheaper American lines. IDT became the third-largest Internet service provider for a time and pioneered Internet phone calling. The company sold that operation, Net2Phone, to AT&T in 1999 for 1.4 billion in cash. Jonas also built an entertainment company that IDT sold to John Malone's Liberty Media (nasdaq: LCAPA - news - people ) for 500 million and a fiber-optic ring around Moscow that brought in another 150 million. His company began running into problems around the time he took off to live in Israel for more than a year, starting in 2004. He claims that most of IDT's losses stem from its 2001 acquisition of Winstar, a wireless broadband outfit. He alleges that former management overstated revenues, and he is suing the Blackstone Group (nyse: BX - news - people ) over the advice it gave on the deal. Today IDT is a sprawling mess--everything from a phone company to ethnic foods, an electric utility and a debt collection agency--but it's a mess that now has Jonas' undivided attention. That isn't reassuring to everyone. William Martin, a former IDT short-seller and the founder of Internet stock message board Ragingbull.com, likes the stock at its 1.75 level but wishes Jonas were out of the picture. \\"If I were Howard Jonas and wanted to protect my net worth, I'd step down, waive my voting rights, bring in independent management and let them run this business properly,\\" says Martin, who manages a small hedge fund called Raging Capital. \\"Our shareholders are beyond pissed off,\\" Jonas admits, referring to the value and hedge funds that own most of IDT's float. \\"But I've let these guys know I'm taking this back over and here's what I'm going to do.\\" Since returning to IDT full-time, he has cut the staff from 8,000 to fewer than 2,000 and vacated half the company's headquarters. He has also finally persuaded state law enforcement officials to clamp down on calling card rivals who, he claims, undercut IDT by shortchanging customers on minutes. Jonas expects IDT to generate at least 30 million in annual operating income (Ebitda) starting in October. Another Jonas brainchild, Zedge, is a social networking portal akin to Facebook and MySpace but for cellular phone users. Zedge is already the largest such cell phone portal, with a registered base now 10 million strong and growing by 20,000 a day. As for shale, it may not be quite as kooky as it sounds. Jonas says that two of the world's seven largest oil firms (he won't name them) are in final negotiations to invest in Amso Resources, of which IDT owns 90%. With interest in alternative energy soaring, might it be time for this telecom guy from the Bronx to look for a hasty sale? \\"To give up on Zedge, or on shale, just before they're going to hit, you'd have to be clinically insane,\\" he says.

The Washington Post reports that Trump's final high-dollar event for the Trump Victory Committee, which splits funds between the party and the candidate, was Oct. 19, the day of the final debate. \\"We are no longer doing formal, sit-down fundraising events,\\" Trump finance chief Steven Mnuchin tells the Wall Street Journal. He says the campaign—which remains far behind the Clinton campaign in fundraising—had always planned to spend the final weeks \\"winning the election\\" by holding rallies, not by using Trump to raise money. Hillary Clinton held her final big fundraiser in Miami Tuesday night, though surrogates including Chelsea Clinton and Tim Kaine are holding at least 40 events between now and the election, while Mnuchin says there is \\"virtually nothing planned\\" by the Trump campaign, the Post notes. Still, Mnuchin and RNC fundraisers say cash is continuing to flow in from various sources, including online fundraising. Trump has vowed to put 100 million of his own money into the campaign, though records show he has only put in 56 million so far, and Mnuchin didn't say whether the candidate plans to donate another 44 million before Election Day. \\"He has been very supportive of the campaign with his contributions,\\" he says.","output":"Donald Trump's Decision to End Big Fundraisers: What It Means for the Republican National Committee In a surprising turn of events, Donald Trump has decided to stop holding big fundraisers, potentially leaving the Republican National Committee (RNC) short of cash for its get-out-the-vote operation. According to the Washington Post, Trump's final high-dollar event for the Trump Victory Committee, which splits funds between the party and the candidate, took place on October 19, the day of the final debate. Trump finance chief Steven Mnuchin told the Wall Street Journal, \\"We are no longer doing formal, sit-down fundraising events.\\" With the campaign remaining far behind the Clinton campaign in fundraising, let's examine the reasons behind this decision and its potential impact on the RNC. The Trump campaign's decision to end big fundraisers can be attributed to its focus on spending the final weeks \\"winning the election\\" by holding rallies, rather than using Trump to raise money. This strategy aligns with Trump's image as an anti-establishment candidate and his dedication to connecting directly with the American people. While the Clinton campaign held its final big fundraiser in Miami on Tuesday night, various surrogates, including Chelsea Clinton and Tim Kaine, are holding at least 40 events between now and the election. In contrast, Mnuchin states that there is \\"virtually nothing planned\\" by the Trump campaign. Despite the sudden halt in big fundraisers, Mnuchin and RNC fundraisers maintain that cash is still flowing in from various sources, including online fundraising. Trump has also pledged to contribute 100 million of his own money to the campaign, although records show he has only put in 56 million thus far. Whether Trump plans to donate the remaining 44 million before Election Day remains uncertain, but Mnuchin assures that \\"he has been very supportive of the campaign with his contributions.\\" The potential consequences of this decision for the RNC are still unfolding. Without significant funds from big fundraisers, the RNC might find itself struggling to support its get-out-the-vote operation. Considering the importance of voter turnout in close elections, this shortfall could hinder the success of the Republican Party in both the presidential race and down-ballot contests. The decision to halt big fundraisers might also signal a shift in the Trump campaign's priorities, as it redirects its focus to rally-centered campaigning. In conclusion, Donald Trump's choice to stop holding big fundraisers is a bold move that emphasizes his dedication to connecting with voters through rallies, rather than traditional fundraising methods. However, this decision could potentially leave the Republican National Committee short of funds for its get-out-the-vote operation, impacting the success of the Republican Party in the upcoming election. While the long-term effects of this decision are yet to be seen, the Trump campaign is undoubtedly taking a different approach in the final weeks leading up to the election."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: I have another guest post for you today. This one comes from Selina from Beautystorm. Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin.  After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: After the story ends, what do you think readers purchase?

Movie plot title: Smokey and the Bandit Part 3 Movie plot: As is the case with the two preceding 'Smokey and the Bandit' films, Smokey and the Bandit Part 3 begins with Big Enos (Pat McCormick) and Little Enos (Paul Williams) offering a sizeable wager on one's ability to transport a shipment a large distance in a short period of time. Offering a slight twist, however, the offer is this time made to a retiring Sheriff Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleason), betting 250,000 against his badge on his ability to transport a large stuffed fish from an eatery in Florida to Texas.Unlike the two earlier films, Big and Little Enos this time seem to be quite active in their desire to see Buford fail in his goal. After Buford dodges their many traps (especially after he destroyed their milk truck, which drenched them and disabled their engine), they then go so far as to actually attempt to hire the Bandit (as a distraction) to stop him. Deciding that the Bandit is too egotistical and hard to manage, they hire Cledus \\"Snowman\\" Snow (Jerry Reed) as his replacement. Accepting the offer, Cledus parks his Peterbilt 359 and climbs behind the wheel of a black and gold 1983 Pontiac Trans Am.He later picks up Dusty (Colleen Camp), who quits her job as a \\"bookkeeper\\" for a used car dealership, but not before attempting to wreck her boss' business (a seedy used car dealership) by badmouthing him in the middle of broadcasting a live TV commercial.The scene of Cledus picking up Dusty in the middle of the road is almost an exact repeat of how Bo picked up Frog in the 1977 film. Cledus manages to catch up with Buford on an interstate, where he then lassoes Buford's fish off of the Justices' police cruiser; Buford needs the fish to retrieve his 250,000. Buford then begins a hot pursuit of Cledus, with another local officer who attempts to take charge of the situation.

In early 1995, Adam Ant and Marco Pirroni joined Nine Inch Nails on stage to perform \\"Physical\\" and other Adam and the Ants songs. During the Dissonance tour, Nine Inch Nails co-headlined with David Bowie, whose own contemporary tour was called the Outside Tour.  Throughout the tour, Nine Inch Nails would perform first and segue into Bowie's band.  The two bands would play a mixture of Nine Inch Nails and David Bowie songs.  Nine Inch Nails would eventually leave the stage and Bowie and his band would continue with their own set. Marilyn Manson appeared on stage at during a concert at Madison Square Garden in 2000 to sing \\"Starfuckers, Inc.\\" and \\"The Beautiful People\\".

The United States is a federal republic consisting of 50 states, a federal district (Washington, D.C.), and various other territories and possessions. Each state has its own unique geography, culture, history, and government.  Here's a brief explanation for each of the other possible answers you mentioned: - Deep South: This term refers to the southeastern region of the United States. It consists of states that are known for their cultural, historic, and geographic distinctiveness. Louisiana is often considered a part of the Deep South, but the term does not encompass the entire United States.   - Gulf States: This term typically refers to the states along the Gulf of Mexico, which include Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. While Louisiana is one of the Gulf States, this term only refers to a specific region and does not encompass all 50 states. - Swamp: Louisiana is famous for its swamps and wetlands, particularly in the southern part of the state. However, this term does not describe the collection of 50 states that make up the United States. - 98% of the world's crayfish: Louisiana is a major producer of crayfish (also known as crawfish or crawdads), a popular culinary delicacy in the region. While the state does account for a significant percentage of the world's crayfish supply, this fact does not pertain to the collective United States as a whole. To sum up, Louisiana is indeed one of the 50 states that together comprise the United States of America.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The plan of the rooms at Belton was passé for a grand house of its time. Following the Restoration and the influx of European ideas, it had become popular for large houses to follow the continental fashion of a suite of state rooms consisting of a withdrawing room, dressing room, and bedroom proceeding from either side of a central saloon or hall. These rooms were permanently reserved for use by a high ranking guest, such as a visiting monarch. While Belton does have a saloon at its centre, enfilades of state rooms of lessening grandeur do not flank it. The possible reason for this unusual layout is that, while the Brownlows possessed great wealth, their title was only a baronetcy, and their fortune was barely a century old. They would have been regarded as gentry, not aristocracy. As a result, building a suite of state rooms would have been in hope rather than anticipation of a royal guest. However, the lack of a fashionable and formal suite of state apartments coupled with the Brownlows' lack of social credentials did not prevent a visit from King William III to the newly completed house in 1695. The King occupied the \\"Best bedchamber\\", a large room with an adjoining closet, directly above the saloon, that led directly from the second floor Great Dining Chamber.This design followed the older style of having reception rooms and bedrooms scattered over the two main floors. The layout used followed Roger Pratt's theory that guest and family rooms should be quite separate. As a consequence of this philosophy, the family occupied the rooms on the first and second floors of the west and east wings, with the state rooms in the centre. The great staircase, designed to be grand and imposing, rose to the east side of the house, and formed part of the guest's state route from the Hall and Saloon on the first floor to the principal dining room and bedroom on the second.The principal entrance hall, reception and family bedrooms were placed on the ground and first floors above a low semi-basement containing service...

The making of conventional glass bottles and the corks   uses large quantities of natural resources and causes a lot of pollution. Beyond manufacturing, the transport of wine in glass bottles across the country and around the world also has its environmental effect. Trucking all the heavy glass bottles causes a much larger carbon footprint than the transportation of much lighter boxed wine. Almost half the weight of an ordinary case of wine comes from the bottles; about 95 percent of the weight of a case of boxed wine is the wine itself. \\"A standard wine bottle holds 750 milliliters of wine and causes about 5.2 pounds of carbon dioxide when it travels from a farm in California to a store in New York,\\" reports Colman, a researcher. \\"A 3-liter box causes about half the carbon dioxide per 750 milliliters.\\" According to the Wine Group, the third largest wine company in the world and a big advocate for switching away from glass bottles, there are other advantages to boxed wine (which typically includes a plastic bag within a cardboard box). The vacuum   packaging of boxed wine allows it to stay fresh for up to six weeks in the fridge once the seal is broken and the first glass has been poured. Still, despite the benefits, boxed wine may still be a tough pill to swallow for many wine experts. \\"Even those traditionalists who are coming around to the idea that maybe screw caps   are fine for some wines, would not like the idea of a cellar   full of cardboard boxes,\\" says wine writer Lee Asbell. \\"It is difficult to imagine how wine service at fine-dining establishments would handle such a change.\\" For now, boxed wine is still the field of cheaper brands.

Question: Given the below context:  During Prohibition, Laurel and Hardy are sent to prison for concocting and selling their own home brew. They are put in a cell with \\"Tiger\\" Long, the roughest, toughest and meanest of all inmates. Stan has a loose tooth that causes him to emit a razzberry at the end of every sentence; the inmate interprets this as a coolly defiant attitude and is impressed—nobody else ever stood up to him like that. He and Stan become fast friends. Laurel & Hardy are assigned to attend prison school with James Finlayson being the teacher. The vaudeville routine that follows ends with a spitball meant for somebody else hitting the teacher in the face and the boys wind up in solitary. There is a sustained scene of the bleak cells with the unseen boys conversing through the walls. After a prison break, the boys escape to a cotton plantation, where they hide out undetected, in blackface. The boys sing \\"Lazy Moon\\". When they attempt to repair the warden's car, they are discovered and are sent back to prison. The prison authorities decide to send Laurel to the prison dentist to have the offending tooth pulled, but the dentist is incompetent and the procedure goes awry. Tricked by a prison guard into calling off a hunger strike by being promised a thanksgiving-style feast, they go to the mess hall, only to be served the usual drab fare. Laurel causes a disturbance by protesting the absence of the feast, but is threatened by the guards. Soon after, as guns are being passed around under the tables, Laurel sets off his gun and causes an uproar. They inadvertently break up the prison riot and the grateful warden issues them a pardon. Laurel unintentionally \\"razzes\\" the warden and their exit from the prison has to be a very fast one.  Guess a valid title for it!

Narada (Sivaji Ganesan), a sage and celestial troublemaker, begins the fight by visiting Saraswati (Savitri), the Goddess of knowledge, and purposely annoys Her by saying that wealth is more important and abundant. Saraswati angrily said that She will prove that Her power, knowledge is more important. Narada then goes to Vaikuntha to see Lakshmi (Devika), the Goddess of wealth, and also annoys Her by saying that education is more abundant and is the best. Lakshmi also retorted that She will prove that Her power of wealth is more important. Narada finally goes to Mount Kailas, seeking Parvati(Padmini), the goddess of power and strength and annoys Her too, saying that wealth and knowledge is more important. Parvati too stressed that She will prove that Her power of strength is more important. The three Goddesses, having turned against each other, each decide to choose someone on earth and bless them powers so that each of them can prove their power and make the other two Goddesses lose.

John found it interesting that many species have evolved in the course of history.  and a hint : Species go extinct constantly as environments change, as organisms compete for environmental niches, and as genetic mutation leads to the rise of new species from older ones. Occasionally biodiversity on Earth takes a hit in the form of a mass extinction in which the extinction rate is much higher than usual. A large extinction-event often represents an accumulation of smaller extinction- events that take place in a relatively brief period of time.The first known mass extinction in earth's history was the Great Oxygenation Event 2.4 billion years ago.

The nine student-run outlets include three newspapers, both a radio and television station, and several magazines and journals. Begun as a one-page journal in September 1876, the Scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States. The other magazine, The Juggler, is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork. The Dome yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University. In 1987, when some students believed that The Observer began to show a conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, Common Sense was published. Likewise, in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias, the conservative paper Irish Rover went into production. Neither paper is published as often as The Observer; however, all three are distributed to all students. Finally, in Spring 2008 an undergraduate journal for political science research, Beyond Politics, made its debut.\\",  answer the following question. Note that the answer is present within the text.

Before we begin solving, we need to identify the type of the equation. It has \\"i\\" terms on both sides, indicating that it is a linear algebraic equation which is to be solved for variable \\"i\\". The approach to solving such equations is to isolate the variable on one side of the equation. Let's start with simplifying the equation. Step 1: Subtract '217580*i' from both sides, so we can get all terms with 'i' on one side of the equation: 217691*i - 217580*i = 666 Step 2: This results in the following equation: 111 * i = 666 Step 3: Then you will solve for 'i' by dividing each side of the equation by 111: i = 666 / 111 So the solution for 'i' in the given equation is i = 6.  Therefore, the value of 'i' that satisfies the original given equation 217580*i = 217691*i + 666 is i = 6. Always remember to check your solution by substituting the found value back into the original equation to verify it holds true."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What two events were the American pressman alerted to that were going to coincide together? from the following article ?

The nine-man group, which included Arnett, Browne, AP photographer Horst Faas, David Halberstam, Neil Sheehan of United Press International, and CBS's Peter Kalischer and photographer Joseph Masraf waited outside the building with their equipment. After an hour-long religious ceremony, the Buddhist monks, numbering around 300, filed out of the pagoda into a narrow alley along a side street, where they were blocked and ordered to stop by plain-clothed policemen. The Buddhists did not resist, but Arnett and Browne began taking photos of the confrontation. The police, who were loyal to Ngo Dinh Nhu, thereupon punched Arnett in the nose, knocked him to the ground, kicked him with their pointed-toe shoes, and broke his camera. Halberstam, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the Buddhist crisis, was a tall man, standing around 20 centimetres (8 in) taller than the average Vietnamese policeman. He waded into the fracas swinging his arms, reportedly saying \\"Get back, get back, you sons of bitches, or I'll beat the shit out of you!\\" Nhu's men ran away without waiting for a Vietnamese translation, but not before Browne had clambered up a power pole and taken photos of Arnett's bloodied face.

Это важное событие, которое традиционно собирает представителей политического и делового сообщества со всего мира. Форум является отличной площадкой для обмена опытом и идеями, а также для обсуждения актуальных проблем мировой экономики и поиска путей их решения. Сегодня я хотел бы поделиться с вами своим видением текущей ситуации в мировой экономике и обозначить основные направления развития российской экономики и внешней политики в ближайшие годы. Как мы все знаем, мировая экономика переживает непростой период. Противоположные тенденции и неустойчивость на финансовых рынках вызывают естественную тревогу. На мой взгляд, приоритеты для всех стран в этой ситуации должны быть направлены на поддержание стабильности и развитие новых, более эффективных механизмов экономического сотрудничества, которые в будущем позволят сглаживать подобные колебания и избегать возможных кризисов. В связи с этим я считаю, что Россия, как одна из ведущих экономик мира, должна активно участвовать в решении этих вопросов и вносить свой вклад в обеспечение стабильности и сохранение мира.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person Mobu tried to bring back to life? ?  Larry Wilson and Richard Parker are at a Manhattan morgue where they see their deceased CEO Bernie Lomax. Larry falsely claims Bernie as his uncle, so he can get some of Bernie's possessions including Bernie's credit card. At the insurance company, Larry and Richard are quizzed by their boss and Arthur Hummel, the company's internal investigator, who ask the two if they have the US2 million that Bernie embezzled. They deny knowing where the money is, but their boss believes they're lying and fires them. He also sends Hummel after them, giving him two weeks to prove their guilt. Over dinner (paid for with Bernie's credit card, in one of its many uses), Larry tells Richard he found a key to a safe deposit box in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands and asks Richard if he will use the computer at work to see if the 2 million is in Bernie's account. At first Richard refuses but ultimately gives in. Meanwhile, in the Virgin Islands, a voodoo queen named Mobu is hired by mobsters to find the money Bernie stole. She sends two servants—Henry and Charles (Tom Wright)—to go to New York, get Bernie's body, use a voodoo ceremony to reanimate him, and bring him back to her so he can lead her to the money. Their attempts to bring Bernie back are plagued by accidents. They prepare in a bathroom at a sleazy porno theater for the voodoo ceremony, but having lost the sacrificial chicken, they use a pigeon instead. This limits Bernie's ability to walk toward the hidden money: he only moves when he hears music. At the 42nd St-Grand Central subway station, Henry and Charles soon abandon him to chase a man who stole their boombox.

Write some highlights for the following article: By. Associated Press. Eric Garner (pictured) died on July 17 after being put in a choke-hold by an NYPD officer. A New York prosecutor will ask a grand jury to consider charges in the death of a black man placed in an apparent choke-hold by a white police officer, he said today. Staten Island District Attorney Daniel Donovan announced that an extra grand jury will be asked to hear evidence next month in the July 17 death of Eric Garner. 'I assure the public that I am committed to conducting a fair, thorough and responsible investigation into Mr. Garner's death, and that I will go wherever the evidence takes me, without fear or favor,' Donovan said in a statement. Garner, a 43-year-old father of six, could be heard on an amateur video shouting 'I can't breathe!' as Officer Daniel Pantaleo placed him in an apparent chokehold. Police said the officers were arresting Garner on suspicion of selling loose, untaxed cigarettes. A second video, which appeared to have been shot shortly after Garner was handcuffed, showed him lying on the sidewalk, apparently unresponsive. More than three minutes in, medics arrive and one checks his pulse. Garner is lifted onto a gurney and transported to a waiting ambulance about two minutes later. A bystander asks why no one is performing CPR and one officer responds, 'because he's breathing.' Garner, who had asthma, died a short time later. Donovan said his decision to take the case to a grand jury was based on his office's investigation and the medical examiner's ruling that the death was a homicide caused by neck compressions from the chokehold, chest compression and Garner's prone position while being restrained. Donovan said a court granted his request for the extra grand jury on Monday. He said in a statement that he would make no additional comment about the panel's work, including possible witnesses and charges, to maintain proceedings' secrecy. Eric Garner's body lies in a casket during his funeral at Bethel Baptist Church in the Brooklyn borough of New York on July 23. Pantaleo, an eight-year NYPD veteran, was stripped of his gun and badge after Garner's death and another officer was placed on desk duty. Two paramedics and two emergency medical technicians were suspended without pay. Pantaleo's lawyer, Stuart London, said it was too early to say whether his client would testify before the grand jury. 'That's a decision that I weigh very carefully,' London said. Patrick Lynch, the president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, said the union expected a grand jury investigation and is encouraged that the process is moving forward. 'We are confident that a fair and impartial grand jury that is allowed to conduct its deliberations based on facts and not emotion or political considerations will see that justice is served,' Lynch said in a statement. Civil rights leader the Rev. Al Sharpton plans to lead a march to Donovan's office on Saturday. Protesters are calling for Donovan to file criminal charges or let federal prosecutors take over. Several members of New York's congressional delegation last week echoed the call for the Justice Department to investigate. They questioned whether Donovan, a Republican, could adequately investigate the case given his close working relationship with police and the borough's large population of police officers. Sharpton said he, Garner's family and the family's lawyers will meet Thursday with U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch to reiterate their desire for a federal investigation. 'This announcement does not impact our move for federal takeover of this case at all,' Sharpton said in a statement.

Step 2: Isolate the variable (b). To find the value of b, we need to isolate it from the rest of the equation. In this case, we need to move the constant term (1137) from the right side of the equal sign to the left side. We do this by subtracting 1137 from both sides of the equation. Step 3: Perform the subtraction. Subtracting 1137 from both sides of the equation, we get: 1133 - 1137 = b + 1137 - 1137 Step 4: Simplify the equation.

Verify the solution by plugging the value ofApp of b back into the original equation: 1133 = (-4) + 1137 1133 = 1133 Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution is correct.

The OP mentions working a night shift, which implies they work during nighttime hours. This is common in various occupations such as security guards, nurses, factory workers, and retail employees. 2. The OP talks about the day crew pushing off work onto them, suggesting that there is a division of responsibilities between day and night shifts. 3. The OP brings up a milk shipment and the importance of having a full milk rack in the chiller for customer relations. This implies that the OP is in some way responsible for stocking perishable goods, which is common in retail, specifically grocery stores or convenience stores. 4. Lastly, the OP mentions that customers might leave the store if they can't find milk, affecting the sales of other items. This again points to the fact that the OP's occupation is likely related to the retail industry.

Question 2: What can men do to stimulate their skin to grow less facial hair? Options: 1). no. 2). yes. Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"The answers to these two questions differ as they address different aspects of hair growth relating to skin hair and facial hair. Question 1: Can I grow my skin hair into a facial hair? The simple answer to this question is no. Skin hair and facial hair are different types of hair, and they have unique growth patterns regulated by genetic factors and hormones. Skin hair, also known as vellus hair, is thin, short, and lightly pigmented, covering most of the body. In contrast, facial hair, also known as terminal hair, is thicker, longer, and darker, usually found on the face and in other areas such as the chest, armpits, and pubic areas. Androgen hormones, specifically dihydrotestosterone (DHT), play a crucial role in stimulating the growth of facial hair. The hair follicles of the face have receptors that are sensitive to androgens, leading to the development of thick and coarse facial hair. On the contrary, other areas of the body have hair follicles that are less sensitive or resistant to androgens, resulting in the presence of thin and fine skin hair. So, it is not possible to transform skin hair into facial hair. Question 2: What can men do to stimulate their skin to grow less facial hair? There are a few methods men can consider to reduce the growth of facial hair or make it appear less prominent. Here are some options: 1. Hormonal therapy: In some cases, excessive facial hair growth might be due to hormonal imbalances. If this is the cause, consulting a medical professional for appropriate hormonal therapy could help to manage the growth of facial hair. 2. Hair removal techniques: Men can consider using hair removal techniques such as shaving, trimming, waxing, or using hair removal creams explicitly designed for facial hair. These methods provide temporary relief from facial hair growth by removing the hair from the surface of the skin. It's important to note that hair will eventually grow back. 3. Laser hair removal: This is a more permanent solution to reducing facial hair growth. Laser hair removal uses light to target and destroy hair follicles responsible for hair growth without causing damage to the surrounding skin. This treatment is a long-term solution as it reduces the number of hair follicles producing hair, leading to slow or minimal hair growth in the targeted areas. 4. Electrolysis: This is another permanent method for hair reduction. Electrolysis uses an electric current to destroy the hair follicle, preventing hair from growing back. This process is time-consuming and can be costly, but many people find it effective in preventing hair growth in targeted areas. 5. Natural remedies: Some people believe that certain natural remedies, such as applying a mixture of turmeric and milk to the unwanted hair or using herbal hair inhibitors (like spearmint tea), can help to minimize facial hair growth. However, the effectiveness of these remedies is not scientifically proven and may not work for everyone. In conclusion, the answers to your questions are different. Skin hair cannot grow into facial hair due to the distinct properties and growth patterns of these two types of hair. To stimulate the skin to grow less facial hair, men can consider options like hormonal therapy, hair removal techniques, laser hair removal, electrolysis, or natural remedies, but the effectiveness of each varies between individuals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

At the top of the petition is a quote from Roman philosopher Cicero: \\"To be ignorant of what went before you were born is to remain always a child.\\" A student taking the A-level at the school, Jamie Williams, said he was now applying to take the subject at university, but only realised he wanted to take a degree in archaeology because he had been able to study it at A-level. Sir Tony Robinson, who presents TV archaeology shows, sent his support to the campaign, saying: \\"I'm certainly with you.\\" Mike Heyworth, director of the Council for British Archaeology, said: \\"This is disastrous news for archaeology. Another vital route into the study of the subject is being removed.\\" The exam board, explaining the decision, said that its \\"number one priority is making sure every student gets the result they deserve\\". But it says that for archaeology - along with classical civilisation and history of art - \\"the complex and specialist nature of the exams creates too many risks on that front\\". \\"Our decisions have nothing to do with the importance of these subjects, and it won't stop students going on to do a degree in them as we're not aware of any universities that require an A-level in these subjects.\\" But the chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Archaeology, Pete Hinton, said: \\"The A-level in archaeology is an important route into the archaeological profession. \\"This should be seen as a serious affront to those who believe that the study of past cultures can bring both positive benefits in terms of cultural understanding, as well as practical transferable skills for students.\\" What is a summary of this text?","output":"A-level archaeology classes are being cancelled and some people, like Sir Tony Robinson, are not happy about it. They say it's an important subject for students to learn about, but the AQA exam board, which makes the tests, thinks it's too hard to do well. Students who have already started the class can finish, but there will be no new students in archaeology. A teacher started a petition to bring back the subject, and many people are signing it, including famous TV presenter Sir Tony Robinson. The exam board says this won't stop students from studying archaeology in university, but some people think it's still a bad idea."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Sling Blade Movie plot: Karl Childers (Billy Bob Thornton) is an intellectually disabled Arkansas man who has been in the custody of the state mental hospital since the age of 12 for having killed his mother and her lover. Although thoroughly institutionalized, Karl is deemed fit to be released into the outside world. Prior to his release, he is interviewed by a local college newspaper reporter, to whom he recounts committing the murders with a Kaiser blade, saying, \\"Some folks call it a sling blade. I call it a kaiser blade.\\" Karl says he thought the man was raping his mother. When he discovered that his mother was a willing participant in the affair, he killed her also. Thanks to the doctor in charge of his institutionalization (James Hampton), Karl lands a job at a repair shop in the small town where he was born and raised. He befriends 12-year-old Frank Wheatley (Lucas Black) and shares some of the details of his past, including the killings. Frank reveals that his father was killed - hit by a train - leaving him and his mother on their own. He later admits that he lied, and that his father committed suicide. Frank introduces Karl to his mother, Linda (Natalie Canerday), as well as her gay friend, Vaughan Cunningham (John Ritter), the manager of the dollar store where she is employed. Despite Vaughan's concerns about Karl's history in the mental hospital, Linda allows him to move into her garage, which angers Linda's abusive alcoholic boyfriend, Doyle Hargraves (Dwight Yoakam). Karl bonds with Linda, who makes him biscuits to eat, and also with Vaughan, who tells Karl that a gay man and a mentally challenged man face similar obstacles of intolerance and ridicule in small-town America. Karl quickly becomes a father figure to Frank, who misses his father and despises Doyle. Karl is haunted by the task given to him by his parents when he was six or eight years old to dispose of his premature, unwanted, newborn brother. He visits his father (Robert Duvall), who has become a mentally unbalanced hermit living in the dilapidated home... My question: Who did Karl become a father figure to?

Question: Two neighbors Paul and Dean studied toghether often. this week they got together and Paul started studying about the Gaia hypothesis, while Dean studied Einstein's Theory of Relativity.  Which person studied more about the stable state?  Hint: The Gaia hypothesis states that the biosphere is its own living organism. The hypothesis suggests that the Earth is self-regulating and tends to achieve a stable state, known as homeostasis . For example the composition of our atmosphere stays fairly consistent, providing the ideal conditions for life. When carbon dioxide levels increase in the atmosphere, plants grow more quickly. As their growth continues, they remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In this way, the amount of carbon dioxide stays fairly constant without human intervention. Answer:","output":"To answer this question, let's break it down step by step. Step 1: Identify the subjects each person studied. - Paul studied the Gaia hypothesis. - Dean studied Einstein's Theory of Relativity. Step 2: Determine which subject involves the study of a stable state. - The Gaia hypothesis involves the study of the Earth as a self-regulating system, seeking to maintain a stable state (homeostasis) through interactions between living organisms and their environment. - Einstein's Theory of Relativity is about the relationship between space and time and the effects of gravity on them; it does not directly relate to studying a stable state. Step 3: Match the person to the subject. - Paul studied the Gaia hypothesis, which is related to the study of a stable state. - Dean studied Einstein's Theory of Relativity, which is not directly related to the study of a stable state. Answer: Paul studied more about the stable state, as his subject, the Gaia hypothesis, is centered around the concept of homeostasis and maintaining a stable state within the Earth's biosphere."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: James Lawrence Levine (; born June 23, 1943) is an American conductor and pianist. He is primarily known for his tenure as Music Director of the Metropolitan Opera (the \\"Met\\"), a position he held for 40 years (1976-2016). He was formally terminated by the Met from all his positions and affiliations with the company on March 12, 2018 over sexual misconduct allegations which he denies. Context: Levine made his Metropolitan Opera (the \\"Met\\") debut at age 28 on June 5, 1971, leading a June Festival performance of Tosca. Following further appearances with the company, he was named principal conductor of the Metropolitan Opera in February 1972. He became the Met's principal conductor in 1973, and its Music Director in 1975. In 1983, he served as conductor and musical director for the Franco Zeffirelli screen adaptation of La Traviata, which featured the Met orchestra and chorus members. He became the company's first artistic director in 1986, and relinquished the title in 2004. In 2005, Levine's combined salary from the Boston Symphony Orchestra and the Met made him the highest-paid conductor in the country, at 3.5 million.  During Levine's tenure, the Metropolitan Opera orchestra expanded its activities into the realms of recording, and separate concert series for the orchestra and chamber ensembles from The Met Orchestra at Carnegie Hall. Levine led the Metropolitan Opera on many domestic and international tours. For the 25th anniversary of his Met debut, Levine conducted the world premiere of John Harbison's The Great Gatsby, commissioned especially to mark the occasion. On his appointment as general manager of the Met, Peter Gelb emphasized that Levine was welcome to remain as long as he wanted to direct music there. Levine was paid 2.1 million by the Met in 2010.  Following a series of injuries that began with a fall (see below), Levine's subsequent health problems led to his withdrawal from many Metropolitan Opera conducting engagements. Following a May 2011 performance of Die Walkure, Levine formally withdrew from all conducting engagements at the Met. After two years of physical therapy, Levine returned to conducting with a May 2013 concert with the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra at Carnegie Hall. On September 25, 2013, Levine conducted his first Met performance since May 2011, in a revival production of Cosi fan tutte. Levine was scheduled to conduct three productions at the opera house and three concerts at Carnegie Hall in the 2013-14 season. On April 14, 2016, Met management announced that Levine would step down from his position as Music Director at the end of the 2015-16 season. Levine was paid 1.8 million by the Met for the 2015/16 season. He assumed the new title of Music Director Emeritus, which he held until December 2017, when in the wake of allegations that Levine had sexually abused four young men, the Met suspended its relationship with him and cancelled all his future scheduled performances with the company. Question: What did he perform? Answer:","output":"James Levine performed as a conductor and pianist throughout his career. In his Metropolitan Opera debut, he led a performance of Tosca on June 5, 1971. He conducted various operas, concerts, and musical events during his tenure at the Met, such as the world premiere of John Harbison's The Great Gatsby, commemorating the 25th anniversary of his debut. Additionally, he served as conductor and musical director for the Franco Zeffirelli screen adaptation of La Traviata in 1983.

Write an article with the title: \\"Report: Apple Supplier Making a Record 500,000 iPhone 5S Units a Day\\" Article:","output":"Title: Report: Apple Supplier Making a Record 500,000 iPhone 5S Units a Day Introduction Apple's growth in the smartphone market has been nothing short of phenomenal, as witnessed by the unprecedented consumer demand for the iPhone 5S. It seems the tech giant has no plans to slow down anytime soon, as new reports indicate that the company's key supplier, Foxconn, is producing an astonishing 500,000 iPhone 5S units per day in order to keep up with growing demand. A Milestone in Smartphone Production The feat of manufacturing half a million units of a single smartphone model each day is an extraordinary accomplishment in the electronics industry. It showcases the unparalleled efficiency of the production process as well as the abilities of Foxconn, which has been highly instrumental in Apple's unprecedented success in the smartphone market. This decision to ramp up production comes as no surprise, given that Apple seeks to fulfill the high demand for the iPhone 5S and stay ahead of the curve in the fiercely competitive smartphone market. The iPhone 5S, which was released on September 20, 2013, and garners rave reviews from tech enthusiasts and regular users alike, has been pivotal in catapulting Apple to its lofty position. What This Means for the Smartphone Market The fact that 500,000 iPhone 5S devices are being produced daily can have far-reaching implications for the smartphone market in general. For one, other smartphone manufacturers are bound to feel the pressure in terms of producing their own high-quality devices in large numbers to stay relevant in the competitive landscape. Additionally, this can result in more innovation and rapid evolution on the part of manufacturers to ensure their devices meet and exceed consumer expectations. It is safe to say that the success of the iPhone 5S puts Apple in a dominant position, and this monumental production figure serves as a wake-up call to other smartphone manufacturers to step up their game in order to stand a chance in this cutthroat market. Implications for Apple and Future Devices The high production numbers for the iPhone 5S not only help Apple meet demand but also indicate the company's strong belief in the sales potential of its flagship device. In many respects, the more devices Apple produces, the better its economies of scale, allowing it to create cost savings and potentially improve profit margins. With this level of production, Apple may well be preparing for other new devices and product launches in the near future. For instance, the tech giant has long been rumored to be working on a new, larger iPhone model, which could further propel its dominance in the smartphone market. Conclusion The news that Foxconn is producing a record 500,000 iPhone 5S units per day only serves to solidify Apple's position as a formidable player in the smartphone market. It's clear that Apple highly values its partnership with Foxconn, as the production efficiency gained through this alliance strongly supports its continued growth and success. As more users around the world demand high-quality smartphones and become increasingly reliant on devices like the iPhone 5S, it's likely that production numbers will continue to remain astronomically high. In that sense, this reported milestone can be seen as a harbinger of things to come in the ever-evolving smartphone market."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The best job in the world's competition finally has a winner, Ben Southall, a 34-year-old charity worker from Britain. He beat 34,000 candidates from 200 countries in an online competition that became something of an Internet phenomenon.  \\"To go away now as the island caretaker for Tourism Queensland and the Great Barrier Reef is an extreme honour.

Also people remember you because of your humour. But I think I don't have a very good sense of humour. Could you suggest how to build on this? ----Radha Karnik This is a great question that is unfortunately difficult to answer. I can only give you my views on this topic, which may or may not be correct. I know that my sense of humour developed over time. When I was younger I was not funny at all, now I can easily make people laugh. At the same time, sometimes I say things that I think are very funny but others do not. Improving wit and humour, I believe, is an ongoing process. Now, there are various forms of humour and everyone has their individual style. Overall, I believe being fluent in a language is very important for being witty or funny. The way we play around with words adds the \\"funny\\" tag to an otherwise normal sentence. Also, seeing irony is very important. I think humour is often the link between two unrelated things. In my experience, laughing frequently and appreciating other people's jokes and wit are very important. Within these, finding humour in everyday normal situations is the key. I often notice what is going on around me and say funny things in my head and laugh to myself. That serves almost as practice for when I am in a group. I watch comedy shows and movies and I am sure that has some effect on helping me improve my sense of humour. And last, having confidence that you are witty is important. There will always be someone wittier or funnier than you, which is fine. Just work on building your own style. Remember, if you are trying to be funny and witty in order to break the ice at a business function, be careful. In those situations, humour has to be mild and politically correct.

During my days as an inmate in Bridges House at the University of New Brunswick, I shared this space with about 99 other testosterone-addled 'young adults' whose charming tendency to get completely out of hand was barely held in check by the rod of authority of the Don and Resident Fellow. This is not to say that these two worthies weren't good at their jobs; more accurately, their task was more akin to herding cats -- fairly obtuse, barely socialized cats. Given the state of controlled chaos that existed, it wasn't unusual for little conflicts to arise from time to time. Being rather physically small and odd, I came in for a certain amount of abuse from someone called Scut, a large and obnoxious Newfie (hmmm, that's like saying that water is wet). I can't remember what it was he did to me, but it was serious enough that I decided to get my own back. It's been said that revenge is a dish best enjoyed cold. I think revenge is a dish best enjoyed in secret with no chance of counter-revenge to spoil the occasion. And so it was that I laid my plans against Scut. The occasion and place were set. My means of entry was secured. Now I needed material. For me, the only good fish is a live one. Even though I hale from NB, I really don't like free-swimming seafood. Considering the unimaginative cuisine of my youth, it's surprising that I eat anything at all. So with dead, smelly fish in mind, I persuaded my friend Shan to pick one up when he was down at the Saturday Farmer's Market. He returned with a four-pound shad, frozen solid.

This is largely due to the vibrant colors and pleasing scents that flowers possess, which can both calm and stimulate the human brain. By having fresh flowers in his home, Brett was creating a space that encouraged relaxation, happiness, and mental clarity. Another advantage of having fresh flowers in the house that Brett appreciated was their ability to purify the air. Many plants, including flowers, are known to absorb harmful pollutants and toxins from the air, effectively acting as natural air purifiers. This not only makes the air safer to breathe but can also help to reduce the risk of developing respiratory issues. Furthermore, the increased oxygen levels in a room with fresh flowers can help to maintain a healthy humidity level, thus contributing to better overall air quality. Aesthetically speaking, Brett also recognized the tremendous value that fresh flowers brought to the overall appearance of his home. By choosing various colors, styles, and arrangements, he was able to use the flowers to create different focal points, complement existing design motifs, and even lend a seasonal touch to his living space. This constant rotation of fresh flowers allowed Brett to keep his home feeling fresh, dynamic, and engaging, enabling him to put his creative stamp on his environment in a subtle yet impactful way. Lastly, Brett believed that having fresh flowers in the house helped to promote a sense of hospitality and warmth. For guests and visitors, the presence of flowers signals that a host has put thought and effort into creating a comfortable, inviting atmosphere. Moreover, the sweet, natural fragrances that flowers exude often serve as a means to stimulate positive memories and associations, helping to create a strong sense of nostalgia and shared experience. In contrast, Eric did not prioritize having fresh flowers in his home, and as a result, he missed out on the numerous benefits that they provided. Whether Eric was simply unaware of the value that fresh flowers held or had other priorities when it came to his living environment, Brett's dedication to keeping fresh flowers in his home ultimately resulted in a more enjoyable, inviting, and healthy space for all who entered."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Robert and Melissa Rogers with their four children before they died in August 2003. Rainfall from a torrential downpour swept the Rogers' minivan off a Kansas highway. As water filled the van, Rogers kicked out a window in a last-ditch effort to save his family. Instead, he and his wife, Melissa, and daughter, Makenah, were sucked out of the van. Hours later, the bodies of children Zachary, 5, Nicholas, 3, and Alenah, 1, still buckled in their car seats, were found inside the van. Rogers survived. Instead of falling into despair, he became a minister dedicated to honoring his family by preaching messages of hope in the face of adversity. \\"It was a huge choice of faith,\\" Rogers told CNN. \\"It was a determination to live life to honor God, to honor my heavenly family, and to make something productive out of it and not just to wallow in my pity.\\"  Watch the story of the Rogers family tragedy ».

Her brother comes to her defense but is killed. Barbara flees the cemetery and discovers what at first seems to be an abandoned farmhouse. She seeks shelter there, only to find another pack of zombies. Shortly after, a man named Ben arrives, and the two clear the house of the dead and begin the process of barricading the doors and windows. They discover other survivors who have been hiding in the cellar of the house: Harry Cooper, a loud and argumentative husband; his wife Helen; their daughter Sarah, who was bitten by a zombie and has fallen seriously ill; teenager Tom Bitner and his girlfriend Judy Rose Larson. The group is divided over what their next course of action should be. Harry believes everyone should retreat to the cellar and barricade the door to wait for the authorities. Ben thinks the cellar is a \\"death trap\\" and that they would be better served fortifying the house, which at least has alternate escape routes, and Barbara suggests that the group should simply leave the house on foot after she notices the zombies' limited mobility. An argument between Ben and Harry leaves the Coopers in the basement to tend to their ailing daughter, and the remaining members remain upstairs to continue their work reinforcing the doors and windows. The loud construction attracts even more zombies to the farmhouse, soon collecting a large mob. The group devises a plan to escape using Ben's truck, which is out of fuel, by refueling at a locked gas pump a couple hundred yards away. A search of the corpse who lived in the farmhouse produces an unknown set of keys. Judy Rose, Tom, and Ben proceed up the hill toward the gas pump, but their plan begins to unravel when Ben falls from the bed of the truck and is left to defend himself.

What is the title of this article: In 1903 Hermann Emil Fischer and Joseph von Mering disclosed their discovery that diethylbarbituric acid, formed from the reaction of diethylmalonic acid, phosphorus oxychloride and urea, induces sleep in dogs. The discovery was patented and licensed to Bayer pharmaceuticals, which marketed the compound under the trade name Veronal as a sleep aid beginning in 1904. Systematic investigations of the effect of structural changes on potency and duration of action led to the discovery of phenobarbital at Bayer in 1911 and the discovery of its potent anti-epileptic activity in 1912. Phenobarbital was among the most widely used drugs for the treatment of epilepsy through the 1970s, and as of 2014, remains on the World Health Organizations list of essential medications. The 1950s and 1960s saw increased awareness of the addictive properties and abuse potential of barbiturates and amphetamines and led to increasing restrictions on their use and growing government oversight of prescribers. Today, amphetamine is largely restricted to use in the treatment of attention deficit disorder and phenobarbital in the treatment of epilepsy.","output":"The title of this article could be: \\"The History and Development of Barbiturates and Amphetamines: From Discovery to Modern Medical Uses\\""},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Next step is to get 's' by itself. To do that, we're going to divide both sides of our equation by -4 because -4 divided by -4 is 1, and we only want 1 's' not -4 's'.

I know that the answer to the question \\"Who is the plaintiff in Hill v. McDonough?\\" is in \\"Traditionally, Section 1983 was of limited use for a state prisoner under sentence of death because the Supreme Court has held that habeas corpus, not Section 1983, is the only vehicle by which a state prisoner can challenge his judgment of death. In the 2006 Hill v. McDonough case, however, the United States Supreme Court approved the use of Section 1983 as a vehicle for challenging a state's method of execution as cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The theory is that a prisoner bringing such a challenge is not attacking directly his judgment of death, but rather the means by which that the judgment will be carried out. Therefore, the Supreme Court held in the Hill case that a prisoner can use Section 1983 rather than habeas corpus to bring the lawsuit. Yet, as Clarence Hill's own case shows, lower federal courts have often refused to hear suits challenging methods of execution on the ground that the prisoner brought the claim too late and only for the purposes of delay. Further, the Court's decision in Baze v. Rees, upholding a lethal injection method used by many states, has drastically narrowed the opportunity for relief through Section 1983.\\".

In 60 years, the Queen has never put a foot wrong in public. And for the last 24 of them, it turns out she's had a secret weapon -- the nice Ella Slack. The former BBC manager has, unknown to anyone except a handful of key advisers, spent the last quarter of a century acting as the Queen's official stand-in at rehearsals   for royal events. The 69-year-old has never accepted a penny for her royal service, considering it \\"a pleasure and an honour\\" to ensure that everything runs smoothly for the Queen. \\"How many people in the world have had a chance to sit in a royal landau   or walk onto the dais   at Windsor Castle even before the Queen has done so?\\" she said. While Miss Slack may not resemble the Queen facially, she has a similar figure to the Queen, standing just 5 foot. The Queen is 5 foot 2 inch. She began her remarkable role in 1988, when she was working as manager of the BBC's sports and events department. A producer asked her if she could stand in for the Queen to check camera angles at a rehearsal -- and her second career was born. Since then, from the State Opening of Parliament   to the 50th anniversary of Victory day, wherever the Queen is on duty Miss Slack is likely to have been there first. She has perfected her own version of the Queen's clothes, including a black patent handbag she bought in a charity shop for PS1, and even styles her hair like the Queen.

Answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  sirocco  for the following movie plot:  An onscreen text warns of the superstitious belief in a vorvolaka, a malevolent force in human form. The film proper begins during the Balkan Wars of 1912. While his troops are burying their dead, General Pherides (Karloff) and American reporter Oliver Davis (Marc Cramer) visit the Isle of the Dead to pay their respects to the General's long-dead wife. They discover the crypt despoiled; hearing a woman singing on the supposedly uninhabited island, they set out to find her. They also find retired Swiss archeologist Dr. Aubrecht (Jason Robards, Sr.), his Greek housekeeper Madame Kyra (Helen Thimig), British diplomat Mr. St. Aubyn (Alan Napier) and his pale and sickly wife (Katherine Emery), her youthful Greek companion Thea (Ellen Drew), and an English tinsmith. While Aubrecht apologizes for his part 15 years ago in inspiring local peasants to rob graves for valuable Greek artifacts, Kyra whispers to the General that a vorvolaka, in the guise of the red and rosy Thea, is in their midst. The General laughs at such superstition and accepts Aubrecht's invitation to spend the night as his guest. The next morning, the tinsmith is dead. Dr. Drossos (Ernst Deutsch) is summoned; he determines the cause to be septicemic plague and quarantines the island. The Doctor explains how plague is passed and how it may be eradicated in one day if the hot, dry sirocco winds arrive. The archeologist says that Mme. Kyra's explanationÂ â that God sends the plague to punish them for harboring a vorvolakaÂ â makes just as much sense. When Mr. St. Aubyn dies, the General demands that his body be buried immediately, to the horror of the cataleptic Mrs. St. Aubyn, who fears premature burial. Next to die is Dr. Drossos, proving that the advice of modern science does not guarantee victory over the disease. Suspicion returns to Thea, and Kyra harasses her with taunts and threats. The General vows that he will kill Thea if evidence appears that she is vorvolaka. Fearing for Thea's life, Oliver plans to escape with her, but the general...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please write a short summary for the following article: The anti-fracking activist barred from 312.5 sq miles of Pennsylvania Vera Scroggins, an outspoken opponent of fracking, is legally barred from the new county hospital. Also off-limits, unless Scroggins wants to risk fines and arrest, are the Chinese restaurant where she takes her grandchildren, the supermarkets and drug stores where she shops, the animal shelter where she adopted her Yorkshire terrier, bowling alley, recycling centre, golf club, and lake shore. In total, 312.5 sq miles are no-go areas for Scroggins under a sweeping court order granted by a local judge that bars her from any properties owned or leased by one of the biggest drillers in the Pennsylvania natural gas rush, Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation. \\"They might as well have put an ankle bracelet on me with a GPS on it and be able to track me wherever I go,\\" Scroggins said. \\"I feel like I am some kind of a prisoner, that my rights have been curtailed, have been restricted.\\" The ban represents one of the most extreme measures taken by the oil and gas industry to date against protesters like Scroggins, who has operated peacefully and within the law including taking Yoko Ono to frack sites in her bid to elevate public concerns about fracking. It was always going to be an unequal fight when Scroggins, now 63, made it her self-appointed mission five years ago to stop fracking in this, the richest part of the Marcellus Shale. Just how unequal became clear on 21 October when the case of Cabot v Scroggins came before a local judge, Kenneth Seamans, in the Montrose court house. Cabot turned up with four lawyers and nine witnesses, employees of the company and the firm it hired to provide security. Scroggins represented herself. She told the court she had been unable to find a lawyer as the hearing had been called on 72 hours' notice. By the time the hearing was over, the judge had granted Cabot a temporary injunction barring Scroggins from all property owned or leased by the company. \\"It is hereby ordered that Ms Scroggins is restrained, enjoined and prohibited from entering upon property owned and/or leased by Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation including but not limited to well sites, well pads and access roads,\\" the injunction reads. The effect of that ban is far broader than the dry legal language would suggest. In court filings, Cabot said it holds leases on 200,000 acres of land, equivalent to 312.5 sq miles. That amounts to nearly 40% of the largely rural county in north-eastern Pennsylvania where Scroggins lives and where Cabot does most of its drilling. The temporary injunction granted on 21 October does not require Cabot to identify or map the lands where it holds drilling leases, putting Scroggins in the bizarre position of having to figure out for herself which areas were off-limits. Cabot later offered to limit the scope of its exclusion order in court filings seeking to make the injunction permanent. The next hearing on that injunction is scheduled for 24 March. Scroggins, who now has a lawyer, is fighting to overturn the injunction. Until then, each trip Scroggins makes outside her home requires a calculation about whether her route will take her on lands or roads leased to Cabot, or a visit to the court house to pore over property records. \\"We need a map. We need to know where I can and can not go,\\" she said. \\"Can I stop here, or can I not stop here? Is it OK to be here if I go to a business or if I go to a home? I have had to ask and check out every person I go to: 'are you leased to Cabot'?\\" Many of those businesses are, it turns out. Susquehanna County is one of the most active areas in Pennsylvania's natural gas rush. Eight of the top 10 most productive gas wells are in the county, according to an industry newsletter. All eight belong to Cabot. Environmental groups say the court – and Cabot - went too far. \\"It seems to be an extraordinarily heavy handed reaction by industry and one which was extremely out of proportion to what she has been doing,\\" said Kate Sinding, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defence Council. Campaigners claim other over-reactions by industry and police against fracking opponents – such as the arrest last December of two protesters in Oklahoma for \\"terrorism hoax\\", after they unfurled a banner and dropped glitter on the floor of an office tower owned by Devon Energy. But Scroggins' lawyer, George Kinchy, says this was the first time to his knowledge that a company has used the full weight of the law against a single activist. He also said Cabot was lucky Scroggins was not represented by a lawyer at the hearing. The company was not pressed to demonstrate the gas leases gave it the right to make such absolute decisions about access. \\"They have no proof that they had the right to exclude her. They didn't present evidence of leases that gave them the right to treat the property as their own,\\" he said. Cabot refused several requests to respond, beyond a brief email statement from spokesman, George Stark. \\"Cabot has a policy of not commenting specifically on litigation to which it is a party,\\" the statement reads. \\"That being said, Cabot supports an individual's right to free speech and regrets having to seek relief from the court in order to prevent Ms Scroggins from repeatedly trespassing on company property, where she could potentially jeopardise the safety of herself and others.\\" However, the company arranged for Tom Shepstone, a consultant who blogs at Natural Gas Now, to speak on its behalf. Shepstone said the injunction was overdue. \\"I'm proud of Cabot and what they've done because they're saying we're not going to take this any longer,\\" he said. Cabot in court filings does not accuse Scroggins of violence or of causing harm to property, and she has never been arrested or charged with trespass. She has not chained herself to machinery, or staged sit-ins. But Shepstone argued Scroggins had upset too many people to be tolerated. \\"I believe she is a public menace because what she does is she essentially trespasses not so much on property – though she does do that – but she trespasses on the soul of the community,\\" he said. \\"She does not allow the people of this community any peace.\\" In the five years since fracking came to north-eastern Pennsylvania, Scroggins has been relentless in trying to exposing the risks associated with the industry. Scroggins and her then husband moved to this very rural area of north-eastern Pennsylvania from Long Island, New York more than 20 years ago, when their children were small. After various careers, Scroggins, now a grandmother, considers herself a full-time activist. She has visited frack sites – posting up to 500 videos on YouTube. She has called in health and environmental regulators at perceived violations, and she has organised bus tours of frack sites for anyone who is interested – from Yoko Ono and Susan Sarandon to visiting Canadian elected officials. None of that activity by Scroggins or other activists was illegal, or presented a public danger, according to Jason Legg, the district attorney for Susquehana County. \\"I don't recall any major protests or people trespassing on any property,\\" he said. Even by Cabot's own admission, in court testimony last October, Scroggins seems to have been more nuisance than danger. Her biggest and most repeated offence, according to court testimony, appears to have been parking her car on access roads – and at times even on the narrow public county roads – at angles that required the big water tankers to swerve around her. Scroggins, who does not appear adverse to confrontation, was also insistent on talking to personnel on site. But in every instance cited by Cabot witnesses, she left the area within 5 or 10 minutes – sometimes after they threatened to call police. By 2011 those repeat visits to gas sites made Scroggins public enemy number one, so far as Cabot was concerned. Cabot's security contractor, Northeast Diversified Services told the court it had posted photographs of Scroggins in their guards' campers, and had been following the activist since 2011. \\"Yes, we follow you, yes, from site to site,\\" the company's vice-president, Thomas Tolan, told the court. Scroggins wasn't winning friends in the community either. There are landowners in Susquehana County who have made money off leasing their land to Cabot and other gas companies for fracking. \\"The consensus is basically that it has been a lifeline to an area that was struggling,\\" Legg said. In a small town like Montrose, population 1,600, Scroggins' forceful brand of activism appears to have been too much for some – though she has a hard core of supporters. In a recent visit to the court house to check on Cabot leases, she was scolded by a court official just for striking up a conversation with the person beside her at the counter. A few minutes later, Thomas Meagher, the county solicitor, said Scroggins brought her legal problems down on herself by failing to following the \\"unwritten rules\\" of civilised discourse. Scroggins rejects the idea that \\"nice\\" has anything to do with it. \\"I am doing this as nicely as I feel is warranted. I have other concerned citizen friends who play passive and they don't get anything done more than I do. They are just in the background,\\" she said. \\"They are playing passive and nobody even hears about them. Those who want to play that womanly role, they can play it. I don't have to.\\" As for Cabot and her critics in the community, \\"They can just get used to it,\\" Scroggins said. Summary:","output":"A lady named Vera Scroggins doesn't like fracking, which is a way to get gas from the ground. A big company called Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation does fracking in the place where Vera lives, in Pennsylvania. She has been trying to stop them from fracking for five years. She even took a famous person, Yoko Ono, to see the fracking sites. The company doesn't like Vera because she speaks against them, so they talked to a judge. The judge said that Vera can't go to any place that the company owns or leases. Because the company owns or leases a lot of places (312.5 square miles!), Vera can't go to many places anymore, like the hospital, supermarket, and even her favorite Chinese restaurant. Vera is fighting against the judge's decision and wants to go to these places again."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In the 2005 remake of King Kong, who played the writer Jack Driscoll?","output":"In the 2005 remake of King Kong, the character of Jack Driscoll, a playwright and screenwriter, was portrayed by the talented American actor Adrien Brody. This version of the movie, directed by Peter Jackson, features an impressive ensemble cast that includes Naomi Watts as Ann Darrow, Jack Black as Carl Denham, Thomas Kretschmann as Captain Englehorn, and others. Adrien Brody is known for his intense and transformative performances that often require him to delve deeply into the emotional and psychological complexities of his characters. Brody won an Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Władysław Szpilman in Roman Polanski's 2002 film, The Pianist. In Jackson's King Kong, the character of Jack Driscoll encounters Skull Island alongside an ambitious filmmaker (Carl Denham) and an aspiring actress (Ann Darrow), who are on a dangerous quest to film the legendary King Kong. Driscoll finds himself drawn to Ann and comes to her rescue when she is captured by the monstrous ape. Throughout the film, Brody's character evolves from a cynical, self-centered writer to a devoted and courageous hero who is willing to risk his life to save others. The 2005 version of King Kong is an epic retelling of the classic 1933 film and brings additional depth, character development, and awe-inspiring visual effects to the timeless tale. Peter Jackson's reimagining of the story was well-received by both audiences and critics alike, and Brody's portrayal of Jack Driscoll contributed to the film's success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Then, we backtrack from the right bottom of the matrix and collect the elements which are common in both lists. Here are the steps of the process: 1. Initialize a matrix LCS with (len(A) + 1) rows and (len(B) + 1) columns. Fill the matrix with zeros. The reason we add 1 to the length of A and B is because we need an extra row and column for the case where we take no elements from A and B respectively. 2. Starting from the second row and second column (i.e., index 1,1), we update each cell LCS[i][j] based on this rule: if A[i-1] == B [j-1] then LCS[i][j] = LCS[i-1][j-1] + 1, else LCS[i][j] = max (LCS[i-1][j], LCS[i][j-1]). This rule basically means if the elements A[i-1] and B[j-1] are the same, then the length of the common subsequence considering till i-th element of A and j-th element of B would be one more than the length of the common subsequence till (i-1)th element of A and (j-1)th element of B. Otherwise, the length would be the maximum between considering (i-1)th element of A or considering (j-1)th element of B. 3. Once the matrix is filled, the cell LCS[len(A)][len(B)] will contain the length of LCS but we need to extract the actual sequence. Start from LCS[len(A)][len(B)] and trace back the elements: if A[i] == B[j], that means the element is a part of the LCS and we add it to the sequence. Then move diagonally to LCS[i-1][j-1]. If A[i] != B[j], compare LCS[i][j-1] and LCS[i-1][j], move towards the direction of the larger value.

Solve -9*b + 153 = 16*b - 97 for b.","output":"To solve the equation -9*b + 153 = 16*b - 97 for the variable b, follow these steps: 1. Get all the terms with b on one side of the equation and the constant terms on the other side.  To do this, let's add 9*b to both sides of the equation to eliminate the -9*b on the left side and add 97 to both sides to eliminate the -97 on the right side. Here's how it looks: -9*b + 153 + 9*b = 16*b - 97 + 9*b 153 = 16*b - 97 + 9*b 2. Combine the terms with b on the right side of the equation. Since both terms on the right side have b, we can combine them: 153 = (16*b + 9*b) - 97 153 = 25*b - 97 3. Isolate the b by moving the constant term to the other side. To get b by itself on the right side, we need to add 97 to both sides of the equation: 153 + 97 = 25*b  250 = 25*b 4. Solve for b by dividing both sides by the coefficient of b. The coefficient of b is 25. To solve for b, divide both sides of the equation by 25: 250 / 25 = 25*b / 25 10 = b So the solution for the equation is b = 10."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I read this background article the other day: Greenhouse Effect: The solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature.  I am facing a new situation today: Two friends liked studying about the Earth's atmosphere. Vick studied more about the troposphere, while Frank studied more about the Greenhouse Effect.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which friend studied more about carbon dioxide?

It is a part of Panama City -- Lynn Haven -- Panama City Beach It is part of the Panama City -- Lynn Haven -- Panama City Beach Available choices: [-] no; [-] yes;","output":"In order to provide a detailed and clear explanation of whether these two sentences mean the same thing, it is necessary to look at the difference between \\"a\\" and \\"the\\" as articles in English. When examining the grammatical aspects of the two sentences, the key difference lies in the use of the articles \\"a\\" and \\"the\\". In English, \\"a\\" is an indefinite article, which is used to refer to a non-specific or nonsingular item. In contrast, \\"the\\" is a definite article that is used to refer to a specific or singular item. 1. It is a part of Panama City -- Lynn Haven -- Panama City Beach. This sentence is using the indefinite article \\"a\\" before the phrase \\"part of Panama City -- Lynn Haven -- Panama City Beach.\\" By using \\"a,\\" the speaker implies that there are multiple parts to this area and that they are referring to just one of those parts. It also implies that the part being referred to is not unique, and there could be other parts that share similar characteristics. 2. It is part of the Panama City -- Lynn Haven -- Panama City Beach. In this sentence, \\"the\\" precedes \\"Panama City -- Lynn Haven -- Panama City Beach,\\" which implies that the speaker is referring to a specific area encompassing Panama City, Lynn Haven, and Panama City Beach. By using \\"the,\\" the speaker is stating that the subject being discussed is a part of, or belongs to, this particular region. Analyzing the contextual meaning of the sentences, both imply that there is a relationship between the subject (referred to as \\"it\\") and the area comprising Panama City, Lynn Haven, and Panama City Beach. In summary, although the two sentences have slightly different grammatical structures, their overall meaning is quite similar. Both sentences convey the idea that the subject is related to or part of the geographical area encompassing Panama City, Lynn Haven, and Panama City Beach. However, the first sentence with \\"a part of\\" can suggest a slightly more ambiguous relationship compared to the second sentence using \\"part of the,\\" which conveys a more definite connection. Consequently, one could say that their meanings are close but not entirely the same."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: WASHINGTON — Legal experts cast doubt Tuesday on a list of questions the special counsel purportedly wants to ask President Donald Trump, saying they would expect the veteran prosecutor to ask more and more pointed questions. The New York Times published the list of 44 questions it said special counsel Robert Mueller plans to pose to Trump as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The newspaper reported that the list was compiled by Trump's lawyers based on questions that were read to them by special counsel investigators. The largely open-ended questions range from queries about Trump's firing of former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former FBI director James Comey, to general inquiries into what Trump knew about alleged coordination between his 2016 presidential campaign and Russia. While the list reflects the general line of questioning the special counsel's investigation is believed to be focused on, legal experts said the questions published are not what Mueller — or any prosecutor for that matter — would ask an interview subject. \\"It doesn't sound like questions that a prosecutor would typically ask, unless it was just a very general information-gathering type of inquiry, and they'd not limit themselves to only those question and reserve the right to ask follow-up questions,\\" said Eric Jaso, a partner at the Spiro Harrison law firm who served as an associate independent counsel during the Whitewater investigation of former President Bill Clinton. The questions, Jaso said, were likely written by Trump's own lawyers, based on a conversation with the special counsel about topics he wants to query. \\"If Mr. Mueller is going to interview the president, I suspect that he's going to ask rather pointed questions rather than having questions that would allow the president to basically give a narrative and potentially go far afield from the topics that they're trying to focus on,\\" Jaso said.

Question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What, exactly, is different between Mahayana and other sects of Buddhism? Context: There is no evidence that Mahāyāna ever referred to a separate formal school or sect of Buddhism, but rather that it existed as a certain set of ideals, and later doctrines, for bodhisattvas. Initially it was known as Bodhisattvayāna (the \\"Vehicle of the Bodhisattvas\\"). Paul Williams has also noted that the Mahāyāna never had nor ever attempted to have a separate Vinaya or ordination lineage from the early schools of Buddhism, and therefore each bhikṣu or bhikṣuṇī adhering to the Mahāyāna formally belonged to an early school. This continues today with the Dharmaguptaka ordination lineage in East Asia, and the Mūlasarvāstivāda ordination lineage in Tibetan Buddhism. Therefore Mahāyāna was never a separate rival sect of the early schools. From Chinese monks visiting India, we now know that both Mahāyāna and non-Mahāyāna monks in India often lived in the same monasteries side by side.

Instructions: In this task, you are given an abstract of article. Your task is to generate title for this article. Preferred titles are under thirty words. Input: All eukaryotes have three nuclear DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, namely, Pol I, II, and III. Interestingly, plants have catalytic subunits for a fourth nuclear polymerase, Pol IV. Genetic and biochemical evidence indicates that Pol IV does not functionally overlap with Pol I, II, or III and is nonessential for viability. However, disruption of the Pol IV catalytic subunit genes NRPD1 or NRPD2 inhibits heterochromatin association into chromocenters, coincident with losses in cytosine methylation at pericentromeric 5S gene clusters and AtSN1 retroelements. Loss of CG, CNG, and CNN methylation in Pol IV mutants implicates a partnership between Pol IV and the methyltransferase responsible for RNA-directed de novo methylation. Consistent with this hypothesis, 5S gene and AtSN1 siRNAs are essentially eliminated in Pol IV mutants. The data suggest that Pol IV helps produce siRNAs that target de novo cytosine methylation events required for facultative heterochromatin formation and higher-order heterochromatin associations.

Summarize: Any microscope will do, but a compound microscope is the best kind for observing microscopic, transparent specimens, such as dust mites. You can buy a compound microscope online or from a retailer that sells them to schools, hospitals, and research organizations.  You can also acquire a cheap microscope with a 10x magnification lens from a toy store, hobby store, or thrift store. You need to use at least 10x magnification when viewing dust mites under a microscope. Using a clear piece of tape, pick up clumps of dust from surfaces such as shelves or the floor. Put the tape on the slide under the lens of the microscope with the power set to at least 10x magnification.  Dust mites are 0.3 millimetres (0.012 in) in size, so they can’t be seen with the naked eye. Use a lint-free, microfiber cloth to handle the slide to avoid getting fingerprints on the glass. Carry the slide between your thumb and forefinger by its sides rather than by the top and bottom. The stage is located at the front of the microscope under the objective lenses. It’s a flat, square platform with metal clips on it for holding slides. Gently lift the clips and close them over each end of the slide to hold it in place. Don’t force the slides under the clips, as they are fragile and can be easily broken. A power switch on the bottom controls the light. Use the dimmer switch by pushing it forward and backward to adjust the lighting. Adjust the light intensity to low with the dimmer switch at the bottom right of the microscope. When you turn the microscope on, increase the light intensity to a level that isn’t too bright or too low. A ring-like object called the diaphragm lets you control the amount of light that reaches the specimen. You can rotate this with your hand to adjust the amount of light under the specimen. It’s located under the stage. You can rotate it by simply turning it with your fingers. This is the level at which dust mites can be seen. If the dust mites are still out of focus, increase the power objective until you see them clearly. They have long hairs along the edges of their bodies and short hairs all over their bodies. They don’t have eyes or antennae.  Under a microscope, you’ll see dust mites crawling all over one another. Dust mites’ mouths resemble heads.","output":"To observe dust mites under a microscope, use a compound microscope with at least 10x magnification.

[POLL]\\" Introduction: The world has always been defined by its constantly changing landscape. Time and time again, decisions are made on a global scale impacting the lives of millions. Controversial moves always spark a divide amongst public opinion, with some supporting the decision while others vehemently disagree. In the current era, where digital advancements have made communication and polling much easier, these controversial issues can now be discussed and debated widely. It is imperative that we take a step back and reflect on whether a particular decision was indeed a smart move. In this article, we explore some of the most debated decisions in recent history and present the results from our exclusive poll. Climate Change and the Paris Agreement: Climate change has been a hot topic, and with good reason. The Paris Agreement, which aims to unite the world in combating climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, was a major turning point in environmental discussions. While the majority of nations united in support of the Paris Agreement, the United States notably withdrew from it in 2020 under the Trump administration. This decision sparked a heated debate on whether or not it was a smart move for the United States. Our exclusive poll found that 72% of respondents felt that withdrawing from the Paris Agreement was a bad decision - primarily due to the scientific consensus on the adverse effects of climate change. Conversely, 28% agreed with the withdrawal, citing economic and sovereignty concerns. Britain's Brexit Decision: Brexit, the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, has been an ongoing discussion for almost half a decade. This controversial move has created divisions not just in Europe, but across the world as well. While some argue that Brexit enables the UK to regain control over its borders and economic policies, others believe it jeopardizes access to the single market and exposes the UK to uncertainties in global trade. Our poll results revealed that 58% of respondents considered Brexit to be a smart move, while 42% disagreed. Reasons for support included preserving national identity and asserting autonomy, whereas those opposed cited economic risks and a potential weakening of British influence over European affairs. COVID-19 Pandemic Management: Organizations and governments worldwide have implemented various strategies to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. From strict lockdowns to more relaxed approaches, there are stark contrasts in how countries have handled the crisis. With the virus still prevalent, it remains debatable whether certain tactics were smarter than others. In our poll, it was found that 59% of respondents thought that strict lockdowns were a smart move in the initial stage of the pandemic, praising the strategy for slowing the spread of the virus and buying time for healthcare infrastructure to prepare. However, 41% disagreed and argued the detrimental impact on the economy and mental health eclipsed the benefits of lockdowns. Conclusion: In an increasingly connected world, people's opinions on significant global decisions are now more diverse than ever. Our exclusive poll helps to shed light on public opinion regarding some of the most impactful events in recent history. While there may never be a unanimous agreement on whether a certain decision was smart or not, these results provide valuable insights into the ongoing debates around these major issues."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: All atoms have equal numbers of what two particles?    Choices:  - nuclei and neutrons  - photons and protons  - electrons and neutrons  - electrons and protons  A: Answer:","output":"All atoms have equal numbers of electrons and protons. Atoms are the fundamental building blocks of matter and are composed of three main types of subatomic particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons. These particles are organized in a particular structure, with protons and neutrons residing in the nucleus (the central part of the atom) and electrons orbiting around the nucleus in what is referred to as electron shells or energy levels. Protons carry a positive electric charge, whereas electrons carry a negative electric charge. Neutrons, on the other hand, have no electric charge (they are neutral). The number of protons in the nucleus of an atom is called its atomic number, which is unique for each element and serves to distinguish one element from another. In a neutral atom (i.e., an atom that has no overall electric charge), the number of electrons is equal to the number of protons. This is because the negative charge of the electrons exactly balances the positive charge of the protons, resulting in a net charge of zero. For instance, carbon atoms have an atomic number of 6, which means that they have 6 protons in their nucleus. In a neutral carbon atom, there are also 6 electrons orbiting the nucleus. The number of neutrons in an atom can vary without changing the identity of the element. Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes. For example, the element carbon has isotopes with different numbers of neutrons (carbon-12, carbon-13, and carbon-14), but all carbon isotopes have 6 protons and 6 electrons, which maintain their identity as carbon atoms. In summary, all atoms have an equal number of electrons and protons, ensuring that they remain electrically neutral and maintain their unique elemental identity. Neutrons, although important for atomic stability, do not play a direct role in the overall balance of charge within an atom."},{"instruction":"Q:-  Bats and other animals produce a high-pitched tone - The sound travels in waves, as sound does - The sound 'bounces' off of a nearby object - The sound wave returns to the bat - The bat hears the echoed sound - Folds in the bat's ear and adaptations in the bat's brain enable it to determine the size, shape, and position of the other object via the properties of the returned sound waves  What might be the last step of the process?

As the World Health Organization (WHO) warned of the potential increase of dengue fever and other climate-sensitive illnesses, Japan saw an almost-seven decade streak of being dengue fever-free end. In the past week, at least 55 people have become ill with dengue fever, confirming fears that the fever, last seen in 1945, is back. The cases have one thing in common -- those affected all appear to have visited Yoyogi Park, one of Tokyo's largest outdoor spaces, and all have complained of mosquito bites. Following fumigation last week, the health ministry and Tokyo metropolitan government trapped and analyzed about 100 mosquitoes from the park and, found strains of the virus, prompting authorities to close large parts of the park as of Thursday afternoon. This week, two models, Saaya, 20, and Eri Aoki, 25, who were filming for \\"King's Brunch,\\" a variety show, in the park, were struck down with the virus, the Nikkan Sports newspaper reported. The dengue outbreak in Japan has seen victims from the age of 10 to those in their 70's. While most people recover within a week, the disease can create discomfort and and can, in rare cases, cause death. The disease, which is mainly transmitted by a type of mosquito (Aedes aegypti), is found in tropical and subtropical climates worldwide. Symptoms include fever, severe headache, rashes and pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pain. Harrowing experience. By all accounts, contracting dengue fever is a harrowing experience. Chris Dwyer, formerly of CNN and now a Hong Kong-based communications consultant, contracted dengue while on vacation in Malaysia in July. Back in Hong Kong after a few days, Dwyer found himself unusually lethargic in the afternoon. The following day he had a fever and a temperature, which got progressively worse. \\"By the onset of that evening I had appalling pain in my joints, really achy, weak limbs and just a sense that I wasn't well at all,\\" he said. \\"This was unlike anything else, it was so debilitating.\\" Eventually, he was admitted into hospital and eventually recovered. where he was put on a drip while doctors monitored his liver and white blood cell count. \\"As far as I understand it I was lucky... there are other symptoms that I've heard are pretty gruesome,\\" he said. Worldwide problem. While dengue fever is not transmitted human to human, the Japanese health ministry said that domestic mosquitoes could have picked it up from people infected abroad. Almost half the world's population lives in high-risk countries, the WHO says. Last year, Singapore suffered a sweeping epidemic, which saw four die of the disease and over 12,000 become infected. Takeshi Kurosu, an assistant professor at Osaka University's Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, said that the Tokyo outbreak was most likely imported into the country by an infected individual, who then transmitted it to domestic mosquitoes. \\"Probably one person who was infected outside Japan went to (Yoyogi) park,\\" he said. \\"It's possible that there was an infected mosquito (transported to Japan) in a bag, but the patient numbers indicate that it was likely an infected person.\\" He says that it is likely that there have been previous, small and undiagnosed outbreaks in Japan before, but this one was flagged by a doctor who had experience spotting the symptoms of the virus. To date there have been no fatalities in the Japanese outbreak, and Kurosu is confident that the virus can be contained. \\"It will (most likely) be controlled. It will be autumn soon and this type of mosquito can't survive the cold weather.\\" Climate-linked spread. The disease is on the rise, and over half of the world's population live in dengue endemic areas. The Japanese outbreak comes as a WHO conference examining the links between health and climate change warned of the risks of infectious diseases like malaria and dengue which are strongly influenced by climate. Higher humidity and temperatures mean mosquitoes can survive longer, increasing the likelihood for transmitting diseases and being able to travel to a wider geographic range. \\"Vulnerable populations, the poor, the disadvantaged and children are among those suffering the greatest burden of climate-related impacts and consequent diseases, such as malaria, diarrhea and malnutrition, which already kill millions every year,\\" said Dr. Flavia Bustreo, WHO Assistant Director-General, Family, Women's and Children's Health in a press release. \\"Without effective action to mitigate and adapt to the adverse effects of climate change on health, society will face one of its most serious health challenges.\\" Kurosu agrees that climate change is a factor, giving rise to longer periods that infected mosquitoes can survive. Adverse conditions, such as drought, however, can also impede the spread of the disease. Drought in parts of India this summer has denied the mosquitoes the water that their larvae need to develop, leading to \\"extremely low\\" numbers of dengue cases this year, the Times of India reported. Urban centers affected worst. Kurosu says, the primary cause of the spread of dengue fever is linked to population movement and the rapid urbanization of developing countries, the majority of which are in the tropical zone most often affected by dengue fever. There is no cure for, and no vaccination against, dengue fever, The disease can develop into a \\"potentially lethal complication\\" called severe dengue, also known as dengue hemorrhagic fever. The WHO estimates that there are over 50-100 million cases of dengue worldwide each year, although a new study says the true number may be four times as high as that appraisal.

If you answered that they are all fruits you are absolutely correct. If you answered that they are all good for your health you are spot on again. Fruits used to be a staple in many diets, however in amongst all of the low carb and anti sugar chaos, many people are now avoiding them. In a rush to rid the diet of ‘toxic sugar’, fruit has fallen on the wayside. However, many studies have shown that fruit is not linked to any adverse health effects, quite the opposite in fact. Most recently researchers in Sweden discovered that eating a diet high in fruits could reduce the risk of an often lethal form of aortic aneurysm. The study collected data from over 80,000 people over a 13 year period and found that people eating at least two whole fruits per day, reduced the risk of developing  an abdominal aortic aneurysm by almost a third. The main fruits that were eaten were apples, pears, bananas, oranges and other citrus fruits. The fruits’ high antioxidant levels may offer protection by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. Eating whole fruits can also reduced the risk of developing diabetes. Earlier this year a study published in the British Medical Journal revealed that certain whole fruits – in particular blueberries, grapes, apples and pears – could lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The study found that over an 18-year period, 6.5% of the 187,382 participants developed diabetes, but those consuming at least two serves of fruit per week reduced their risk by up to 23%.

Is the premise \\"Two girls sitting on a chair being sketched.\\" true if \\"Someone is sketching a picture of two girls.\\"?","output":"The premise \\"Two girls sitting on a chair being sketched.\\" can be considered as true if \\"Someone is sketching a picture of two girls,\\" depending on the context and the actual subject of the sketch. To fully analyze the situation, we must consider several factors. First, let's review the statements and their meanings: 1. \\"Two girls sitting on a chair being sketched.\\" - This statement focuses on the subject of the sketch, describing the scene as two girls sitting on a chair and someone sketching them. 2. \\"Someone is sketching a picture of two girls.\\" - This statement provides information that someone is actively sketching, and the subject of the sketch is two girls. Now, let's elaborate on different possible scenarios to determine whether the premise is true in each case: Scenario A: If the sketch artist is indeed drawing a picture of two girls sitting on a chair, then the premise is absolutely true. The scene described in the first statement aligns with the information provided in the second statement. Scenario B: If the sketch artist is drawing two girls, but they are not sitting on a chair, the premise is only partially true. The second statement holds true in this case as it mentions someone sketching two girls. However, the first statement is not accurate since the girls are not sitting on a chair, altering the scene. Scenario C: If the sketch artist is drawing two girls sitting on a chair, but the finished sketch does not show them in that scene (e.g., it was an initial pose that was later changed), the premise could be seen as true, but not in the final outcome. In these circumstances, the premise is true from the standpoint of intent, but not in the final execution. In conclusion, the premise \\"Two girls sitting on a chair being sketched\\" can be considered true if \\"Someone is sketching a picture of two girls\\" under certain scenarios. The truth of the premise can be confirmed when the sketch artist draws two girls sitting on a chair as the final subject. If the girls are not sitting on a chair in the sketch, the premise is only partially true, and if the intent changes during the process and the final sketch does not show them sitting on a chair, the premise holds true only during the initial stage. To avoid ambiguity, a clearer statement could be framed as, \\"Someone is sketching a picture of two girls who are sitting on a chair.\\" This statement unifies the information and affirms the accuracy of the given premise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Euro 2012 Soccer Live Blog: England vs. Italy This game surprised me at the start with its pace. Now, though, we're back to a classic Italian display. The midfield is gluing the ball to its feet and searching with passes that end with wasted shots. An Italian miscommunication sends England on the break. Oh, but it ends with a lousy cross that's easily intercepted. Ooh! Abate puts a cross in toward the back post. Cassano headed back in front of goal and Balotelli tried to shoot, but Terry cleared it for a corner. That was the most tactical setup of the half. But like all efforts before, it ended with a whole lotta nothing. One of the problems England is having is that Italy has figured out how to slow down their counterattacks. In the first 10 minutes, England's passing and pace were overwhelming the Italians. Now Italy is pressuring the passes and shifting that gearbox from fifth to first. Speaking of that defense, it just put a perfect tackle on Rooney, which incensed the Englishman. We should start a betting pool for which striker (Balotelli or Rooney) flies off the handle first. Ooh, and while I'm typing, Cassano hits a good shot. Italy might be one of the only soccer nations where fans consider their defenders to be superstars on par with strikers. They're like the Pittsburgh Steelers of international soccer. You know there haven't been many whistles thus far. And that's impressive, given it's Italy on the pitch. This game has only had five fouls. I'll call that one a record. After dozing off, we've had two shots on opposing ends to spark this one back to life. First Balotelli hit a shot on the volley that was a good effort, just right at Hart. And then Rooney teed one up for Welbeck, who wasted the pass with a wide left shot. Still, it was action! One theory could be that England is letting the Italians pressure them to open the Italian backside for a counterattack. But that's probably over-thinking this one. I think we're witnessing Italian passing superiority. Italy is taking control in the midfield courtesy of the maestro Pirlo. England had that early wave of attacks, but they've gone cold for the last 10 minutes. Let's use history as our guide for predicting the rest of this game. Italy has won 10 times in the Euro quarterfinals. England, on the other hand, usually loses if they even make it this far. Oh, man, Balotelli somehow stayed onside for a long through ball. It was him, Terry and Hart. Balotelli couldn't get his shot off in time, and Terry went all kamikaze in front of it. The ball bounced off Terry and out of danger. Big waste by the Italians. Best line from the commentators thus far: \\"That referee's assistant is awfully eager.\\" It was in reference to a tugging foul against Balotelli. Now I wish our American commentators weren't so afraid of giving the refs a little ribbing when they goose a call. Balzaretti wins a corner from pretty much nothing, but it's easily covered. I believe we're dangerously close to entering the doldrums, when Italy grinds a game to a crawl. I could be wrong, though. Italy is regaining some control in the midfield, but England's defense is covering passes well. England also has eight guys around the box when Italy is advancing, which makes shooting within 30 yards a non-starter. Cassano takes the free kick and botches it big time. England goal kick. Hey, Balotelli is still in the game! We haven't seen him since the opening minutes. He wins a free kick on the right touch line after a foul by Lescott. One of the better shots ESPN is using during this tournament is the slow-motion replay of goalies yelling at their defense. I think you can actually see the moment Buffon almost had a mini stroke after yelling about a cross that Rooney headed over the goal. I wish there were a way to bet on the pace of the game. I think if anyone thought this one would start at lightning speed, he would have been betting on 99-to-1 odds. And he'd be cashing a ticket right now. It's still electric, and England is controlling the midfield. Rooney sneaks down the back line and tries to connect with Welbeck at the near post. It's a corner, but Banucci heads it clear. I think Italy is a bit surprised by the cohesion of the British attack. England is playing an aggressive game, but each time they go forward, they cough it up and Italy is looking sharp on the counterattack. Buffon's wingspan is equal to a pterodactyl. He threw up a left arm and easily got a hand on Johnson's shot, which a more human goalkeeper would have totally missed. So much for a timid game. These teams are playing on fire (a la NBA Jam c. 1993). Now it's Glen Johnson's turn! A Milner cross landed at Johnson's feet just a couple of yards (or meters) from the goal. He hit it, but the giant Buffon got a mitt on it. Great chance and a great save. De Rossi hits the post! The volley had Hart beaten, and it was swerving toward the upper corner. It just swerved a little too much and tapped the woodwork. Great start for Italy. Good movement from the Italians. De Rossi tried a through ball for Balotelli, who let it go, but Cassano was there fro a cross. Nothing of it. Still, Italy has been in control for the last 180 seconds. Balotelli decides to give it a go on a volley from 35 yards out. It's easy for Hart and almost humorously ambitious. Game on. Italy gets it underway. Now for 90 minutes of holding soccer. Yeehaw. Wow, six Italians enter this game carrying yellow cards. If they advance, they could have a very weakened team against Germany. Not that it matters much right now. I do love the Italian anthem. It's very operatic, especially compared to England's odd variation of \\"My Country tis of Thee.\\" Almost national anthem time. If you combined all the thoughts of the sports experts, just about every English player has been problematic. Each expert seems to single out one or two, but there's never any overlap. My votes for shaky play go to Johnson and Milner. The pregame punditry seems to think Rooney will drop back as a fifth midfielder should the Italians cause possession issues. So it looks like Italy will be playing 4-3-1-2. That's actually quite a standard formation. I'm disappointed. England is going for ye olde 4-4-2. I have no idea what Italy's formation will look like today. Probably something like 2-7-1. They've played some interesting formations in the tournament thus far. So instead of guessing at tactics, I'll just give you the roster. Buffon is the goalie (and the only player on the pitch who was there when these two countries last played in a tournament 10 years ago). His defense includes Balzaretti, Abate, Barzagli and Bonucci. Marchisio, De Rossi, Montolivo and Pirlo are the Italian midfield. And, oh look, Balotelli gets the start along with Cassano. Roy Hodgson did not make a change for the starting lineup. In fact, a criticism of his managing style is that he rarely makes a change, even when things aren't working. But this roster is. Hart is in goal with the usual back four of Johnson, Cole, Terry and Lescott. The midfield is anchored by the captain Gerrard. He's joined by Young, Milner and Parker. Wayne Rooney is up front with Welbeck in support. Standard fare, really. The reward for winning Group D was avoiding Spain. The kicker? That team, England, now has to play Italy. The press is seemingly always saying Italy is too old and too far gone to win tournaments. And yet they almost always make it this far, if not all the way to the title. (See: World Cup 2006.) England entered the tournament like they almost always do: hyped by the hometown press to win it but with cracks in the framework showing. What does all that gobbledegook mean? Both England and Italy will likely play a pensive, holding game today. They're both fearful of leaving the defense exposed. So, like most of Italy's matches, this one has all the makings of a 1-0 win or even a victory through penalty kicks. Which team pulls out that win is a tough one to predict. England has looked much more tactical and organized under Roy Hodgson. Instead of a collection of egos and pretty boys, the English have formulated attacks and held on in defense. But we don't want to fall prey to the British tabloid habit of overhyping. England also looked shaky and uncertain against Ukraine. Wayne Rooney's winner in that game was more of a sigh of relief than an exclamation point. Rooney's return meant England had a reliable attacking option, but he wasn't an offensive force at first. Rooney could be the lynchpin for an English victory against Italy, but he has a tendency to exit major tournament games with injuries or red cards. Speaking of tempers, Mario Balotelli might well be the deciding factor in this game. He's known equally for his brilliance in goalscoring and his boneheadedness in earning red cards. The cliche of saying \\"which Mario will show up\\" couldn't be truer. If he's out for goal-scoring blood, it'll be trouble for England. If he's out for regular old blood, then Italy could be playing down a man. Italy has already managed a tie against Spain, which is a victory in itself. They've shown they are comfortable changing tactics depending on the opponent. And they should feel confident that their defensive midfielders and back line can handle what England brings. England avoided Spain, but whoever wins today gets the equally unenviable task of facing Germany. We'll find out who that is this afternoon.

To do that, we need to get \\"a\\" by itself on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides by 14. (14*a) / 14 = 0 / 14 When we divide, both 14s cancel out on the left side, and we're left with: a = 0 So the answer is a = 0. And that means in this problem, \\"a\\" equals zero."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Given the following context:  Hex Enduction Hour was the first Fall album to make the UK Albums Chart, where it spent three weeks, peaking at no. 71. By mid-1983 it had sold 20,000 copies, reflecting a surge in the band's popularity, and five years into their career brought them to the attention of record labels. Critics were highly enthusiastic; according to Simon Ford, they could \\"have hardly been more supportive\\". Reviewing the album in the NME, Richard Cook described the band as tighter and more disciplined than in earlier recordings, \\"their master piece to date\\", while still maintaining their impact. He praised the band's use of recording-studio techniques and atmospherics without resorting to glamorisation. Melody Maker's Colin Irwin said it was \\"incredibly exciting and utterly compelling\\".  A dissenter was Neil McCormick of Irish fortnightly Hot Press, who dismissed the album as secondhand melodramatic punk and wondered if the album was \\"meant to be minimalist or primitive then it fatally ignores the true primitivism of the strong melody and accessible lyrics found in folk music.\\"Later, Record Collector described the album as a \\"taut, twitchy and ominous masterclass in DIY post-punk\\", and singled out Smith's lyrics for praise. The Quietus, in 2009, wrote of the album as \\"arguably ...

Arranging \\"involves adding compositional techniques, such as new thematic material for introductions, transitions, or modulations, and endings... Arranging is the art of giving an existing melody musical variety\\".  - Lovefreekz is the alias of British House music producer / remixer Mark Hadfield .

Israel's Prison Service released footage on Sunday, May 7, 2017, that it says shows Barghouti,... (Associated Press)      JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel's Prison Service released footage on Sunday that it says shows the leader of a mass Palestinian hunger strike breaking his fast, a claim dismissed by the Palestinians as an attempt to undermine the open-ended strike, now in its 21st day.      Assaf Librati, a spokesman for the prison service, said strike organizer and Palestinian uprising leader Marwan Barghouti ate a candy bar on May 5 and cookies on April 27. He said surveillance was increased and Barghouti was caught on film eating.      Footage aired by Israeli media shows a prisoner sitting down fully clothed on a toilet unwrapping something and putting it in his mouth. Other footage shows a prisoner eating something near a sink.      Qadoura Fares, who heads an advocacy group for Palestinian prisoners, cast doubt on the footage, saying Barghouti is being held in solitary confinement and has no access to food.      \\"This is a fabrication,\\" Fares said of the footage released Sunday. \\"This is psychological warfare that we expected Israel to wage against the strike.\\" He said that \\"the prisoners will not buy this account from the Israeli side, and they will continue their strike.\\"      Barghouti, a leader of the second Palestinian uprising, is serving five life terms after being convicted by an Israeli court of directing two shooting attacks and a bombing that killed five people. Barghouti, who disputed the court's jurisdiction and did not mount a defense, has been in prison since 2002.      Polls suggest that the 58-year-old Barghouti is the most popular choice among Palestinians to succeed 82-year-old Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.      Palestinians have held large rallies in support of the hunger strike since it began. After decades of conflict, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have been imprisoned at one time or another for acts ranging from stone-throwing to carrying out attacks that wounded or killed Israelis.      Palestinians say the mass hunger strike is an attempt to improve conditions inside the jails and gain more family visits. Israeli officials have dismissed the strike as a bid by Barghouti to burnish his credentials in an internal Palestinian power struggle.      \\"This hunger strike was never about the conditions of the convicted terrorists, which meet international standards,\\" Israeli Minister of Public Security Gilad Erdan said. \\"Barghouti is a murderer and hypocrite who urged his fellow prisoners to strike and suffer while he ate behind their back.\\"      Fares said earlier Sunday that some of the hundreds of Palestinians participating in the hunger strike began taking vitamin supplements on day 15. He said guards had punished the strikers by seizing all personal items and leaving prisoners \\"with nothing except their beds.\\" He says the information comes from lawyers who recently visited the strikers.      Israel holds about 6,500 Palestinians on charges related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israel says 890 prisoners are participating in the hunger strike. ||||| Israel Prison Service released footage of Marwan Barghouti, one of the leaders of the hunger strike by Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, eating in his cell.      >> Get all updates on Israel and the Palestinians: Download our free App, and Subscribe >>      skip - Israel releases footage of leader of Palestinian hunger strike eating in his prison cell      The prison service says Barghouti, who serves multiple life sentences for his role in the killing of Israelis during the second intifada, has twice been filmed eating since the strike began. The first time, on April 27, the footage shows him eating cookies. He removed the cookies from a hiding place in his bathroom, looked around to see that nobody was watching and then ate them. He then tried to conceal the evidence by hiding the wrapping and washing his hands and face.      The second time, on May 5, he employed the same technique. This time, he was filmed eating a candy bar. At the end, he was also seen eating salt.      The Israel Prison Service didn’t say how Barghouti obtained the food, but sources in the organization confirmed that they set him up in an attempt to see whether Barghouti was really sticking to the hunger strike.

ABBAS MOMANI/AFP      The footage was allegedly filmed in the Kishon Prison, to which Barghouti was transferred after the strike began.      “As we’ve said all along, the terrorists’ hunger strike isn’t about their prison conditions, but only about Barghouti’s desire to bolster his status in preparation for the day after Abu Mazen,” said Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan, referring to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas by his nickname. “Barghouti is cynically exploiting the terrorists for a hunger strike for which they are paying and will pay a heavy price, while he himself can’t restrain his own appetites.”      Barghouti was sentenced in 2004 to five life sentences after being convicted of murder. ||||| JERUSALEM — As Palestinian prisoners ended the third week of a mass hunger strike, Israel released videos that it said showed the strike leader, Marwan Barghouti, sneaking snacks in his cell.      Palestinian leaders dismissed the videos, released on Sunday, as fakes aimed at deflating the strike of over 1,000 prisoners, which has stirred protests and clashes with security forces in Palestinian areas. The prisoners are demanding better conditions in Israeli jails.      Prison officials said the videos showed Mr. Barghouti, the strike’s organizer, eating cookies on April 27 and then a candy bar on Friday. He is being held in solitary confinement at the Kishon prison.      Israel’s public security minister, Gilad Erdan, said the strike was not about prison conditions, which he said exceeded international standards, but about Mr. Barghouti’s political goals. Though serving life sentences for five murders during the Second Intifada of the early 2000s, Mr. Barghouti, 57, is popular among Palestinians and is seen as a possible successor to the unpopular Palestinian Authority leader, Mahmoud Abbas, 82. |||||Summary:","output":"Israel's Prison Service released footage on Sunday, May 7, showing Marwan Barghouti, the leader of a mass Palestinian hunger strike, eating. The strike, which involves around 1,000 prisoners, has been running for 21 days in protest of poor conditions in Israeli jails. Palestinians dismissed the video as fake and an attempt to discredit the strike movement. Israeli Minister of Public Security Gilad Erdan dismissed the strike as a political gesture, stating that the prison conditions in question comply with international standards. Barghouti is currently serving five life sentences after being convicted by an Israeli court for orchestrating several attacks during the second Palestinian uprising."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The band is well known for politically charged lyrics and activism, focusing on anti-war activism, anti-imperialism, class struggle, human rights, and various sociopolitical sentiments. The line-up includes singer/guitarist Justin Sane and drummer Pat Thetic, who founded the band; later members are guitarist Chris Head, and singer/bassist Chris Barker (#2) who replaced Jamie \\"Cock\\" Towns, who had replaced original bassist Andy Flag in 1997 following his departure one year prior. Anti-Flag is known also for their advocacy of progressive political action groups such as Greenpeace and Amnesty International. In 2000, Anti-Flag was invited to participate in Vans Warped Tour. During this time, the members of Anti-Flag met NOFX's Fat Mike, owner of the Fat Wreck Chords record label. This meeting spawned a friendship that would lead to Anti-Flag's release of two albums on the label.  In 2001, Anti-Flag teamed with punk music producer Mass Giorgini to record the album Underground Network, released on Fat Wreck Chords. The release of the album is arguably the band's breakout from the hardcore underground to a more mainstream spotlight. The album continued to address the issues of fascism (specifically neo-Nazis infiltrating the \\"hardcore scene\\") and the United States' foreign policy. The album was the first to contain the now-commonplace booklet filled with essays from historians and political commentators, most notably Professor Howard Zinn. In February 2002, Anti-Flag released the album Mobilize on A-F Records. The album featured eight new studio tracks as well as eight live tracks of songs from other albums. In the wake of the September 11th terrorist attacks on the United States, Anti-Flag spoke out against the push for war with the album's title track \\"911 for peace\\". During this time, many music stores pulled Anti-Flag's records from shelves, as their music was labelled as \\"anti-American.\\" In 2003, Anti-Flag released the album The Terror State on Fat Wreck Chords. The album primarily focused on criticizing the Bush Administration's handling of the War on Terrorism. Again, the album contained a booklet full of essays from the band as well as other political commentators. The album contains a song whose lyrics were originally written by Woody Guthrie entitled \\"Post-War Breakout.\\" The track's music was arranged by the members of Anti-Flag, as Guthrie had never committed the arrangements to paper.  On October 8, 2004, U.S. Representative Jim McDermott gave a speech in the House of Representatives, praising Anti-Flag for their work in encouraging young people to register and vote.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Did they do anything else notable on that record label?","output":"Yes, they did something notable on that record label.

Article: President branded a misogynist and macho-fascist after saying mutilating women fighters would make them “useless”      President Rodrigo Duterte has been branded a misogynist and “macho-fascist” after he ordered soldiers to shoot female communist rebels in the vagina.      In a speech to over 200 former communist soldiers in Malacañang last week, the Philippines president gave a directive of what to do with female guerrilla fighters.      Thousands dead: the Philippine president, the death squad allegations and a brutal drugs war Read more      “‘There’s a new order coming from the mayor, ‘We will not kill you. We will just shoot you in the vagina,’ ” said Duterte. He went on to say that without their vaginas, women would be “useless”.      Duterte mentioned the Visayan word “bisong”, meaning vagina, repeatedly throughout the speech, although it was later censored from an official Palace transcript, replaced simply with a dash. However, the remarks were recorded as having drawn laughter from the audience.      The crude orders drew anger from human rights organisations and women’s groups in the region.      “It is just the latest in a series of misogynist, derogatory and demeaning statements he has made about women,” said Carlos H Conde, the Philippines researcher for Human Rights Watch.            “It encourages state forces to commit sexual violence during armed conflict, which is a violation of international humanitarian law.”            Congresswoman Emmi de Jesus, speaking on behalf of the Gabriela Women’s Party, denounced President Rodrigo Duterte as a “macho-fascist,” and said his “anti-women” remark “takes state terrorism against women and the people to a whole new level”.      She described the president as the “most dangerous macho-fascist in the government right now,” adding: “He has further presented himself as the epitome of misogyny and fascism rolled in one.”      Duterte has a chequered history of making menacing and misogynistic remarks towards women. During his election campaign in 2016, speaking about the 1989 prison riot in which an Australian missionary was killed, and inmates had lined up to rape her, Duterte joked he wished he had the opportunity to rape her himself.      “Was I mad because of the rape? Yes, that’s one. But, she was so beautiful, the mayor should have been first. What a waste,” he said. In May last year, he also told soldiers in Mindanao – apparently as a joke – that while martial law was imposed, he would protect them from prosecution if they raped three women.      Last week it was announced that the International Criminal Court were looking into complaints that Duterte had committed crimes against humanity in his brutal and bloody war against drugs, which has seen a deat toll of over 4000. But the President said he did not mind being indicted and imprisoned by the International Criminal Court as long as it allows conjugal visits by more than one woman.      His spokesperson Harry Roque subsequently dismissed the allegations that Duterte was sexist and misogynist.      “You know, sometimes, these feminists are really a bit OA (overacting),” said Roque. “I mean, that’s funny. Come on. Just laugh.” ||||| MANILA — President Rodrigo Duterte, the Philippine strongman who has earned a reputation for dirty tactics and language, was criticized on Monday for having boasted that he had ordered soldiers to shoot female communist guerrillas in the genitals.      “Tell the soldiers, ‘There’s a new order coming from the mayor,’ ” the president said in a speech, recalling a directive he said he had given when he was mayor of Davao City. “ ‘We will not kill you. We will just shoot you in the vagina.’ ”      Mr. Duterte made the remarks in a speech to former rebels last week, but the comments went largely unreported because he was speaking in his native Visayan language. He expressed exasperation that some women preferred joining the New People’s Army, a communist rebel force that has been waging an insurgency since 1969, to raising children.      Since Mr. Duterte’s remarks began circulating more widely, the criticism of his choice of words has been fierce. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Okay sweetie, you know how some people in charge can say mean things sometimes?

That made a lot of people very angry, because it's not nice to say such things or to hurt people this way. Some people are saying he is not respecting women, which is very wrong, and they are calling him bad names because of it. Even before this, he used to say hurtful things about women.

Answer this question: where does the word bric a brac come from??","output":"The term \\"bric-a-brac\\" is a phrase used to describe small, ornamental objects or decorative items of little value, often collected and displayed in people's homes. The origin of the word \\"bric-a-brac\\" can be traced back to the French language and its evolution over time, with multiple factors contributing to its formation and adoption in the English vocabulary. Originally, the components \\"bric\\" and \\"brac\\" did not have any specific meanings in French. The phrase \\"bric-a-brac\\" is an example of reduplication, a linguistic term referring to the repetition of words or syllables to create a new word or phrase. Reduplication is common in the French language and can be found in other expressions as well, such as \\"crème de la crème\\" and \\"pas de deux.\\" This form of word construction not only adds emphasis and poetic qualities to the language but also serves a communicative purpose. It is suggested that \\"bric-a-brac\\" is derived from the French term \\"à bric et à brac,\\" which translates to \\"at random\\" or \\"any old way.\\" This term may have been used to describe the haphazard assortment of objects one might find in a miscellaneous collection. The term \\"à brac\\" is also thought to have evolved from the Old French word \\"abraker,\\" which means \\"to break\\" or \\"to destroy.\\" This connection might represent the notion that bric-a-brac items are generally considered to be of lower value. The evolution of \\"bric-a-brac\\" also involves the gradual change of meaning and usage in the English language. In the late 19th century, the term \\"bric-a-brac\\" was adopted into English from French and initially referred to a mixture of miscellaneous objects, particularly those that were possibly broken or of little worth. However, over time, the meaning shifted to emphasize the ornamental and decorative aspects of these items, as opposed to their lack of value. By the early 20th century, bric-a-brac became more closely associated with collections of antique and vintage objects, which were often displayed to showcase the tastes and interests of the collector. The popularity of bric-a-brac in English-speaking countries is also evident in its frequent mention in the literature of the time, such as works by Charles Dickens and Oscar Wilde. In conclusion, the word \\"bric-a-brac\\" has its roots in the French language, through the combination of \\"bric\\" and \\"brac,\\" a reduplication expressing the random or haphazard nature of these decorative items. Over time, the term has evolved to focus on the ornamental aspects of these objects, becoming synonymous with collecting and displaying vintage and antique items of little monetary value but high sentimental or aesthetic appeal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The reservoir fills in the spring from snow melt and underground springs. The lake is usually at full level by late spring, but in the occasional years of low snow melt and low rainfall, it may remain up to several feet below its typical level. Water is let out of the lake in the fall so that ice will not damage docks and other structures around the lake. This also leads to excellent water quality, as a significant portion of the water is replaced every year.
