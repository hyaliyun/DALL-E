Though any storage tank for fuel may be so called, the term is typically applied to part of an engine system in which the fuel is stored and propelled (fuel pump) or released (pressurized gas) into an engine. Fuel tanks range in size and complexity from the small plastic tank of a butane lighter to the multi-chambered cryogenic Space Shuttle external tank.      The fuel tanks for B-25 bombers      Fill caps on a BMW automobile for hydrogen (left) and for gasoline (right) fuel tanks      Uses [ edit ]      Typically, a fuel tank must allow or provide the following:      Storage of fuel: the system must contain a given quantity of fuel and must avoid leakage and limit evaporative emissions.      Filling: the fuel tank must be filled in a secure way, without sparks.      Provide a method for determining level of fuel in tank, gauging (the remaining quantity of fuel in the tank must be measured or evaluated).      Venting (if over-pressure is not allowed, the fuel vapors must be managed through valves).      Feeding of the engine (through a pump).      Anticipate potentials for damage and provide safe survival potential.      Plastic (high-density polyethylene HDPE) as a fuel tank material of construction, while functionally viable in the short term, has a long term potential to become saturated as fuels such as diesel and gasoline permeate the HDPE material.      Considering the inertia and kinetic energy of fuel in a plastic tank being transported by a vehicle, environmental stress cracking is a definite potential. The flammability of fuel makes stress cracking a possible cause of catastrophic failure. Emergencies aside, HDPE plastic is suitable for short term storage of diesel and gasoline. In the U.S., Underwriters Laboratories approved (UL 142) tanks would be a minimum design consideration.      Fuel tank construction [ edit ]      While most tanks are manufactured, some fuel tanks are still fabricated by metal craftsmen or hand-made in the case of bladder-style tanks. These include custom and restoration tanks for automotive, aircraft, motorcycles, boats and even tractors. Construction of fuel tanks follows a series of specific steps. The craftsman generally creates a mockup to determine the accurate size and shape of the tank, usually out of foam board. Next, design issues that affect the structure of the tank are addressed - such as where the outlet, drain, fluid level indicator, seams, and baffles go. Then the craftsmen must determine the thickness, temper and alloy of the sheet he will use to make the tank. After the sheet is cut to the shapes needed, various pieces are bent to create the basic shell and/or ends and baffles for the tank. Many fuel tanks' baffles (particularly in aircraft and racecars) contain lightening holes. These flanged holes serve two purposes, they reduce the weight of the tank while adding strength to the baffles. Toward the end of construction, openings are added for the filler neck, fuel pickup, drain, and fuel-level sending unit. Sometimes these holes are created on the flat shell, other times they are added at the end of the fabrication process. Baffles and ends can be riveted into place. The heads of the rivets are frequently brazed or soldered to prevent tank leaks. Ends can then be hemmed in and soldered, or flanged and brazed (and/or sealed with an epoxy-type sealant) or the ends can be flanged and then welded. Once the soldering, brazing or welding is complete, the fuel tank is leak-tested.[1]      Automotive fuel tanks [ edit ]      The maximum distance a combustion-engine powered car with a full tank can cover is the product of the tank capacity and its fuel efficiency (as in miles per gallon). While larger tanks increase the maximum distance, they also take up more space and (especially when full) add to the total weight, requiring higher fuel consumption for the same performance. Fuel-tank capacity is therefore the result of a trade-off in design considerations. For most compact cars, the capacity is in the range 45–65 litres (12–17 US gal); the original model Tata Nano is exceptional with its 15 litres (4 US gal) fuel tank. SUVs and trucks tend to have considerably larger fuel tanks.      For each new vehicle a specific fuel system is developed, to optimize the use of available space. Moreover, for one car model, different fuel system architectures are developed, depending on the type of the car, the type of fuel (gasoline or diesel), nozzle models, and region.      Two technologies are used to make fuel tanks for automobiles:      Metal (steel or aluminum) fuel tanks welded from stamped sheets. Although this technology is very good in limiting fuel emissions, it tends to be less competitive and thus less on the market, although until recent times automotive fuel tanks were almost exclusively made from sheet metal.      Plastic high-density polyethylene (HDPE) fuel tanks made by blow molding. Blow molded HDPE can take complex shapes, for instance allowing the tank to be mounted directly over the rear axle, saving space and improving crash safety. Initially there were concerns over the low fracture toughness of HDPE, when compared to steel or aluminum. Concern for safety and long term ability to function should be considered and monitored.      Modern cars often feature remote opening of the fuel tank fuel filler flap using an electric motor or cable release. For both convenience and security, many modern fuel tanks cannot be opened by hand or otherwise from the outside of the car.      Reserve tank [ edit ]      Sometimes called the reserve tank is a secondary fuel tank (in many cars/bikes it contains around 15% of the capacity of the primary tank) these are more commonly found on bikes, older cars (some without a fuel gauge) and vehicles designed for long distance or special use. A light on the instrument panel indicates when the fuel level dips below a certain point in the tank. There is no current standard, although some efforts are made to collect this data for all automobiles.      In vehicles modified for endurance the primary tank (the one that comes with the car) is made into a reserve tank and a larger one installed. Some 4x4 vehicles can be fitted with a secondary (or sub-tank) by the dealership.      Ship in a bottle [ edit ]      The ship in a bottle fuel tank is a manufacturing design developed by TI Automotive in Rastatt, Germany wherein all fuel delivery components including the pump, control electronics and most hosing are encased within a blow-molded plastic fuel tank,[2] and named after the traditional ship-in-a-bottle mechanical puzzle. The technique was developed to reduce fuel vapor emissions in response to Partial Zero-Emission Vehicle (PZEV) requirements.[3] The first application was for the 2005 Ford GT.      Racing fuel cell [ edit ]      A racing fuel cell has a rigid outer shell and flexible inner lining to minimize the potential for punctures in the event of a collision or other mishap resulting in serious damage to the vehicle. It is filled with an open-cell foam core to prevent explosion of vapor in the empty portion of the tank and to minimize sloshing of fuel during competition that may unbalance the vehicle or cause inadequate fuel delivery to the motor (fuel starvation). The designation \\"racing\\" is often omitted due to familiarity and because this type of gas tank is also used on street vehicles. The omission can lead to confusion with other types of fuel cells. See Fuel cell (disambiguation).      Placement and safety [ edit ]      For safety considerations, in modern cars the fuel tank is usually located ahead of the rear axle, out of the crumple zones of the car.      Automobiles such as the Ford Pinto or the models that still use the Ford Panther platform (Ford Crown Victoria, Lincoln Town Car, and Mercury Grand Marquis) are notorious for having the fuel tank behind the rear axle. Since 1980 new Ford models corrected this problem and had the fuel tank in front of the rear axle.[4]      General Motors 1973-1987 C/K pickup trucks have the fuel tank located outside the frame. According to the Center for Auto Safety this creates a fire hazard.[5] In automotive applications, improper placement of the fuel tank has led to increased probability of fire in collisions. Circa 1990, General Motors faced over a hundred product liability lawsuits related to fires allegedly caused by GM's decision to place the fuel tanks in its pickup trucks outside the protection of the vehicle's frame.[6] In 1993, reportage on this matter for NBC News created a scandal over vehicles rigged to catch fire for the television camera.      Ford's Pinto also sparked controversy for putting the fuel tank in a poorly reinforced area which can cause deadly fires and explosions if the car got into a rear-end collision, costing Ford US125 million.      Likewise for safety reasons, the filler could no longer be in the middle back of the car in the crumple zone and thus had to be on the side of the car. Which side is a series of trade-offs: driver's side is easier to access, and mechanically simpler for gas cap locks; passenger side is safer (away from passing traffic in roadside fill-ups). Asymmetric sliding doors may also dictate placement and some minivan doors will collide with a fillup in progress.[7]      Aircraft [ edit ]      Layout of a modern airliner's main fuel tanks      Aircraft typically use three types of fuel tanks: integral, rigid removable, and bladder.      Integral tanks are areas inside the aircraft structure that have been sealed to allow fuel storage. An example of this type is the \\"wet wing\\" commonly used in larger aircraft. Since these tanks are part of the aircraft structure, they cannot be removed for service or inspection. Inspection panels must be provided to allow internal inspection, repair, and overall servicing of the tank. Most large transport aircraft use this system, storing fuel in the wings, belly, and sometimes tail of the airplane.      Rigid removable tanks are installed in a compartment designed to accommodate the tank. They are typically of metal construction, and may be removed for inspection, replacement, or repair. The aircraft does not rely on the tank for structural integrity. These tanks are commonly found in smaller general aviation aircraft, such as the Cessna 172.      Bladder tanks, or fuel cells, [8] are reinforced rubberized bags installed in a section of aircraft structure designed to accommodate the weight of the fuel. The bladder is rolled up and installed into the compartment through the fuel filler neck or access panel, and is secured by means of metal buttons or snaps inside the compartment. Many high-performance light aircraft, helicopters and some smaller turboprops use bladder tanks. One major down-side to this type of tank is the tendency for materials to work harden through extensive use making them brittle causing cracks. [ citation needed ] One major plus side is the ability to use as much of the aircraft as possible to store fuel.      are reinforced rubberized bags installed in a section of aircraft structure designed to accommodate the weight of the fuel. The bladder is rolled up and installed into the compartment through the fuel filler neck or access panel, and is secured by means of metal buttons or snaps inside the compartment.

One major down-side to this type of tank is the tendency for materials to work harden through extensive use making them brittle causing cracks. One major plus side is the ability to use as much of the aircraft as possible to store fuel. Combat aircraft and helicopters generally use self-sealing fuel tanks.      Fuel tanks have been implicated in aviation disasters, being the cause of the accident or worsening it (fuel tank explosion).[9][not in citation given] For example:      The official \\"probable cause\\" for the explosion and subsequent crash of TWA Flight 800 is that an explosive fuel/air mixture existed in one of the aircraft's fuel tanks. Faulty wiring then provided an ignition source within the tank, destroying the airliner. While the accuracy of the official findings is still questioned in this case, similar explosions have occurred in other aircraft. It is possible to reduce the chance of fuel tank explosions by a fuel tank inerting system or fire-fighting foam in the tanks. [10]      Burning fuel can explode or set fire to the same airplane or adjacent objects and people. In the 1960 Munich Convair 340 crash, a transport crashed into a major street. Burning fuel set fire to a tramcar. All 20 people aboard the plane and 32 passengers of the tram died.[11]      In some areas, an aircraft's fuel tank is also referred to as an aircraft fuel cell.      Water supply [ edit ]      Water supply systems can have primary or backup power supplied by diesel-fueled generators fed by a small \\"day tank\\" and a much larger bulk storage fuel tank.[12][13]      Safety [ edit ]      Proper design and construction of a fuel tank play a major role in the safety of the system of which the tank is a part. In most cases intact fuel tanks are very safe, as the tank is full of fuel vapour/air mixture that is well above the flammability limits, and thus cannot burn even if an ignition source were present (which is rare).      Bunded oil tanks are used for safely storing domestic heating oil and other hazardous materials. Bunding is often required by insurance companies, rather than single skinned oil storage tanks.      Several systems, such as BattleJacket and rubber bladders, have been developed and deployed for use in protecting (from explosion caused by enemy fire) the fuel tanks of military vehicles in conflict zones.[14]      See also [ edit ] ||||| FILE - This March 21, 2013 file photo shows U.S. actor Paul Walker wearing a creation from the Colcci summer collection at Sao Paulo Fashion Week in Sao Paulo, Brazil.

A federal judge in Los Angeles ruled... (Associated Press)      LOS ANGELES (AP) — The widow of a man driving the Porsche that crashed and killed actor Paul Walker cannot prove the carmaker is responsible for the accident, a federal judge said.      There was not enough evidence in Kristine Rodas' claims that her husband died because the Porsche Carrera GT he was driving lacked several key safety features, U.S. District Judge Philip S. Gutierrez ruled Monday.      He said there was no evidence the Porsche's suspension failed before the crash, as Rodas' lawsuit claimed. She also had alleged the rare sports car lacked a crash cage and fuel cell.      \\"Plaintiff has provided no competent evidence that Rodas' death occurred as a result of any wrongdoing on the part of defendant,\\" Gutierrez wrote.      Walker was riding in the Carrera GT driven by his friend Roger Rodas when the car spun out of control, struck three trees and burst into flames on a street in Santa Clarita in November 2013. Walker was on a break from filming the seventh installment of the \\"Fast & Furious\\" franchise when he died.      The ruling has no bearing on two other cases against Porsche filed by Walker's daughter and father, which are both pending in Los Angeles Superior Court.      Meadow Walker's attorney said in a statement that while Rodas was killed instantly in the crash, Walker was still alive when the car caught fire.      \\"Meadow will continue the fight to hold Porsche accountable for selling a defective product that kills,\\" attorney Jeff Milam wrote.      Porsche has denied wrongdoing in the design, manufacture or marketing of the Carrera GT. The company also contended in the lawsuit by Walker's daughter that the car had been altered and improperly maintained and that those factors contributed to the crash.      An email to Porsche seeking comment was not immediately returned Tuesday.      An investigation by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and California Highway Patrol concluded that unsafe speed, not mechanical problems, caused the crash. Investigators said the Porsche was going up to 94 mph (151 kph) when it crashed.      Engineers from Porsche, who evaluated the wreckage of the rare car, helped in the investigation.      All the cases against Porsche contend the car was going much slower before it spun out of control. The Walkers' suits say the vehicle was traveling between 63 and 71 mph (101 to 114 kph).      Kristine Rodas sued over the crash in May 2014. Her attorney, Mark Geragos, said Tuesday that the ruling will be appealed.      Gutierrez faulted Rodas' expert for initially relying on an analysis of tire marks taken a month and a half after the fatal crash rather than photos investigators took at the scene.      After Walker's death, his two brothers helped complete action scenes in \\"Furious 7,\\" which earned more than 1.5 billion globally when it was released in April.      ___      Anthony McCartney can be reached at http://twitter.com/mccartneyAP . ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

Summarize: It will bring together officials from the Middle East Quartet, the UN, Arab League and other countries - but Israel and the Palestinians will not participate. Israel has rejected the meeting and called for direct negotiations. The last round of talks between Israel and the Palestinians came to an end amid acrimony in April 2014. The Palestinians accused Israel of reneging on a deal to free prisoners, while Israel said it would not continue negotiations after the Palestinians decided to bring the Islamist Hamas movement into a unity government. Sykes-Picot: The map that spawned a century of resentment Is one homeland the solution? How to untie diplomacy's Gordian knot? Diplomats say Friday's meeting will bring together all the economic incentives and other guarantees that various countries have offered in previous years to create an agenda for an autumn peace conference. French diplomatic sources quoted by AFP news agency said the talks would focus on the 2002 Saudi peace initiative, which offered Arab recognition of Israel in return for the creation of a Palestinian state in territories occupied by Israel since 1967. On Monday Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the Saudi plan included \\"positive elements\\". However, the managing director of Israel's foreign ministry, Dore Gold, likened the French talks to the 1916 Sykes-Picot agreement, which carved up the Middle East between colonial powers, and said only direct talks could resolve the conflict. \\"This effort utterly failed then and will completely fail today,\\" he said. \\"The only way to get a stable regional arrangement that will allow us to create real peace in the Middle East is if the parties of the region come to understandings between them.\\" On Wednesday Mr Netanyahu called for \\"direct negotiations without preconditions between the sides\\". US Secretary of State John Kerry will attend the talks but Reuters quoted a US official as saying the US did not have any new proposals to put forward. There have been numerous rounds of peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians since the early 1990s. Some of the most intractable issues include the status of Jerusalem, Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and Palestinian statehood. The Palestinians seek an independent state in the West Bank, with East Jerusalem as its capital. Israel, which has occupied East Jerusalem since the 1967 Middle East war, regards the whole of the city as its indivisible capital, though this is not recognised by the international community. Since 1967, Israel has built more than 100 settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.","output":"Officials from the Middle East Quartet, the UN, Arab League, and other countries will participate in a meeting to discuss an agenda for an autumn peace conference.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: President Donald Trump is counting on congressional Republicans to enact a package of tax cuts in the coming weeks, in the process delivering his first major legislative achievement since taking office in January. But even as Trump and his Republican allies close in on the goal of passing tax reform, the Russia investigation continues to be a major distraction. The recent plea deal between Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and the office of special counsel Robert Mueller sent shockwaves around Washington and at the very least seemed to indicate the Russia probe is a long way from being completed. Trump is banking on a tax cut victory to shore up his political base and show supporters and detractors alike that he is a man of his word when it comes to delivering on his campaign promises. House and Senate negotiators are now working to resolve differences in the two versions with hopes of final votes in the coming weeks. But even if the tax plan is enacted into law, its impact is not likely to be felt for at least a year. And polls show the plan has less than majority support. Trump insists the tax cuts will lead to economic growth and more jobs. “I will tell you this is in a nonbraggadocio way,” Trump told supporters in Missouri recently. “There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished. That I can tell you.” Democrats oppose the tax plan but lack the votes to stop it. “It rewards the rich in terms of individuals and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle class families in our country,” warned House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Despite his poor standing in national polls, just less than 40 percent approval in most surveys, Trump’s base is largely sticking with him. The latest American Values Survey by the Public Religion Research Institute found that 84 percent of Republicans continue to back the president. According to the above context, answer the following question. Based on the article, the tax plan is likely to: Answer:","output":"Based on the article, the tax plan is likely to: 1.

After receiving an unexpected phone call that she has won a spot to participate on a television game show, she becomes obsessed with regaining the youthful appearance she possesses in an old photograph. To reach her goal, she goes to a doctor to discuss weight loss. The doctor gives her a prescription for weight-loss amphetamine pills throughout the day and a sedative at night. As the months go by, Sara's tolerance for the pills adjusts and as a result she is no longer able to feel the same high the pills once gave her. When her invitation does not arrive, she increases her dosage from double to triple and, as a result, begins to suffer from amphetamine psychosis. Meanwhile, Sara's son Harry is young and has an adventurous life with his girlfriend Marion Silver and best friend Tyrone C. Love. He and his friends are all heroin addicts, and Harry funds his habit through petty theft, including from his own mother who turns a blind eye. Tyrone decides that to support themselves, they should enter the illegal drug trade around Coney Island. With the promised money, each addict hopes to achieve their dreams. At first, the trio's drug dealing business thrives. However, Tyrone is imprisoned after fleeing the scene of a drug-gang assassination and Harry uses most of their earned money to post bail. After the assassination, the three find it much more difficult to find heroin due to supply being restricted by the Florida-based wholesalers.

Given the question: The following article contains an answer for the question: Who are the two  youngest of the Bielski brothers? , can you please find it?   The film is based on actual events, beginning in August 1941.  Nazi Einsatzgruppen (task forces) are sweeping through Eastern Europe, systematically killing Jews. Among the survivors not killed or restricted to ghettoes are the Belarusian Jewish Bielski brothers: Tuvia, Zus, Asael and Aron. Their parents are dead, killed by local police under orders from the occupying Germans. The brothers flee to the Naliboki Forest, vowing to avenge the deaths of their parents. They encounter other Jewish escapees hiding in the forest, and the brothers take them under their protection and leadership. Tuvia kills the local Auxiliary Police chief responsible for his parents' deaths. Over the next year, they shelter a growing number of refugees, raiding local farms for food and supplies and moving their camp whenever they are discovered by the collaborationist police. Bielski brothers stage raids on the Germans and their collaborators. Casualties cause Tuvia to reconsider this approach because of the risk to the hiding Jews. Rivalry between the two eldest brothers, Tuvia and Zus, fuels a disagreement between them about their future; as winter approaches, Zus decides to leave the camp and join a local company of Soviet partisans, while his older brother Tuvia remains with the camp as their leader.

Write some highlights for the following article: Russian President Vladimir Putin has been accused of wanting to restore the Soviet Union after he sent 2,000 tonnes of humanitarian aid across the border into Ukraine. A convoy of 250 Russian army trucks, painted white, are heading towards the eastern Ukrainian city of Luhansk. The development prompted Ukrainian prime minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk that Putin's 'goal is to take the entire of Ukraine'. The trucks left Russia overnight and arrived approached the disputed frontier shortly before dawn. The convoy passes through the Ukrainian border at Izvarino without being inspected by customs officers. The aid convoy of an estimated 250 trucks crossed the border on its way to the Ukrainian town of Lugansk. He added: 'He [Putin] cannot cope with the idea that Ukraine would be a part of a big EU family. He wants to restore the Soviet Union,' Yatsenyuk said. The Russian emergency ministry, which coordinated previous humanitarian aid deliveries to Ukraine, could not be reached for comment about the convoy. Colonel Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council, told journalists Saturday that the convoy had crossed 'illegally' onto Ukrainian territory. 'Ukraine border guards and customs were not allowed to examine the cargo and vehicles. 'Representatives of the Red Cross don't accompany the cargo, nobody knows what's inside.' Colonel Lysenko's relatively mild comments on the second convoy and the silence of more senior Ukrainian officials shows how dramatically the mood has shifted in the Kiev government since August. President Petro Poroshenko has been at pains to prove that last week's cease-fire deal has yielded improvements on the ground in east Ukraine. On Friday, he lauded the deal, which has been riddled by violations since it was imposed last week, as a 'fragile but efficient peace process.' In August, Ukrainian officials said that a first convoy of humanitarian aid from Russia would be seen as an invasion of the country, and loudly protested any attempts by Russia to unilaterally bring in the aid. Ukrainian officials fear that the convoy would have been carrying military equipment instead of food. Russian officials claimed the aid was needed because of severe shortages in the eastern city of Lugansk. Workers unloaded an estimated 2,000 tonnes of 'humanitarian aid' according to Russian officials. Eventually Russia sent its trucks across the border and into rebel-held territory without the oversight of the International Red Cross, contrary to an agreement signed between Ukraine and Russia. A representative of the ICRC's Moscow office said they had not been informed about the current convoy, either. Galina Balzamova of the ICRC said: 'We were not officially notified of an agreement between Moscow and Kiev to ship the cargo.' Colonel Lysenko said that six Ukrainian servicemen had died since the truce. He also confirmed that 12 rebel fighters had been killed by Ukrainian forces near Sea of Azov city of Mariupol, where he said they were doing reconnaissance work - the first such admission that they have inflicted casualties on the rebel side since the cease-fire began. In a statement posted online early Saturday, the Donetsk city council said that there had been fighting near the airport throughout the night. Two shells had hit residential buildings in the area but no casualties were reported. Continuous rocket fire could be heard overnight in downtown Donetsk, and a column of three GRAD rocket launchers - all its rockets still in place - was seen moving freely through the rebel-held city on Saturday morning. Yury Stepanov, a Russian official overseeing the convoy said the convoy consisted mainly of foodstuffs - rice, sugar, and canned fish and beef - but also included medicine, technical equipment and clothes. The deliveries were in closed boxes, small enough to be easily carried by one person, but rice was seen spilling from a broken bag. Stepanov said his team was responsible only for delivery, and distribution will be handled by local authorities - which for now means the separatist leaders of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic. Gennady Tsepkalo, a senior separatist official, said the aid would first and foremost be given to retirees, hospital patients and schoolchildren. He said the food would not be used to feed rebel fighters. He said: 'The militia will feed itself separately. This is for the residents of the Luhansk People's Republic.' The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's observer mission to the Russian-Ukrainian border said Saturday that they had seen 220 trucks cross into Ukraine, none of which were inspected by the Ukrainian side or accompanied by the ICRC.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - Geneva (, , , ) is the second most populous city in Switzerland (after Zürich) and is the most populous city of Romandy, the French-speaking part of Switzerland. Situated where the Rhône exits Lake Geneva, it is the capital of the Republic and Canton of Geneva.  - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.  - The Swiss Plateau or Central Plateau  constitutes one of the three major landscapes in Switzerland alongside the Jura Mountains and the Swiss Alps. It covers about 30% of the Swiss surface. It comprises the regions between the Jura and the Alps, partly flat but mostly hilly, and lies at an average height between 400 and 700 m AMSL. It is by far the most densely populated region of Switzerland, and the most important with respect to economy and transportation.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state.  - Central Europe lies between Eastern Europe and Western Europe. The concept of Central Europe is based on a common historical, social and cultural identity. Central Europe is going through a phase of \\"strategic awakening\\", with initiatives such as the CEI, Centrope or V4. While the region's economy shows high disparities with regard to income, all Central European countries are listed by the Human Development Index as very highly developed.  - Liechtenstein , officially the Principality of Liechtenstein, is a doubly landlocked German-speaking microstate in Central Europe. It is a constitutional monarchy with the rank of principality, headed by the Prince of Liechtenstein.  - TechnoMarine watches reflect the exciting history of a new but already firmly - established watch - making company . In December of 1997 , Franck Dubarry , a successful French entrepreneur and diver , overwhelmed by passionate love for the sea and a great appreciation for nice designs , presented into the horology world his first creation - the TechnoMarine watch .

TechnoMarine creations are embellishing the wrists of their loyal fans , among which there are such diverse...  - A chronograph is a specific type of watch that is used as a stopwatch combined with a display watch. A basic chronograph has an independent sweep second hand; it can be started, stopped, and returned to zero by successive pressure on the stem. Less simple chronographs use additional complications and can have multiple independent hands to measure seconds, minutes, hours and even tenths of a second. In addition, many modern chronographs use moveable bezels as tachymeters for rapid calculations of speed or distance. Louis Moinet invented the chronograph in 1816 for use in tracking astronomical objects. Chronographs were also used heavily in artillery fire in the mid to late 1800s. More modern uses of chronographs involve piloting airplanes, car racing, diving and submarine maneuvering.  - The city of Bern or Berne (; Bernese German: \\"Bärn\\" ) is the de facto capital of Switzerland, referred to by the Swiss as their (e.g. in German) \\"Bundesstadt,\\" or \\"federal city\\". With a population of 141,762 (November 2016), Bern is the fourth most populous city in Switzerland. The Bern agglomeration, which includes 36 municipalities, had a population of 406,900 in 2014. The metropolitan area had a population of 660,000 in 2000. Bern is also the capital of the canton of Bern, the second most populous of Switzerland's cantons.  - Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a federal republic in Europe. It consists of 26 cantons, and the city of Bern is the seat of the federal authorities.  The country is situated in Western-Central Europe, and is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north, and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. Switzerland is a landlocked country geographically divided between the Alps, the Swiss Plateau and the Jura, spanning an area of . While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately eight million people is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities are to be found: among them are the two global cities and economic centres Zürich and Geneva.  - The Alps are the highest and most extensive mountain range system that lies entirely in Europe, stretching approximately across eight Alpine countries: Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Slovenia, and Switzerland. The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. Mont Blanc spans the FrenchItalian border, and at is the highest mountain in the Alps. The Alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than 4000 metres (just over 13,000 feet).  - Louis Moinet (1768 - 1853), inventor of the chronograph, was born into a prosperous family of farmers in Bourges, France, was a French horologist, sculptor and painter.  - Artillery is a class of large military weapons built to fire munitions far beyond the range and power of infantry's small arms. Early artillery development focused on the ability to breach fortifications, and led to heavy, fairly immobile siege engines. As technology improved, lighter, more mobile field artillery developed for battlefield use. This development continues today; modern self-propelled artillery vehicles are highly mobile weapons of great versatility providing the largest share of an army's total firepower.

Write an article with the title: \\"What’s the debt ceiling, and why is everyone in Washington talking about it?\\"","output":"Title: What’s the debt ceiling, and why is everyone in Washington talking about it? Step 1: Introduction Start the article by briefly explaining the current situation in Washington regarding the debt ceiling and its relevance. Introduction: The term \\"debt ceiling\\" is currently a hot topic in Washington, but many people are unsure about what it actually is and why it has become so important. This article aims to clarify the concept of the debt ceiling and explain the reasons behind its increasing prominence in recent political discussions. Step 2: Define debt ceiling Explain what the debt ceiling is by providing a definition and its significance in the context of the US federal government's finances. Definition of debt ceiling: The debt ceiling is the legal limit on the amount of money that the United States federal government is allowed to borrow to meet its financial obligations. This limit is set by Congress and can be adjusted when necessary. Step 3: Discuss the history of the debt ceiling Introduce the historical context and how the debt ceiling started since the establishment of the Second Liberty Bond Act of 1917. History of the debt ceiling: The debt ceiling has its origins in the Second Liberty Bond Act of 1917, which was established to help the country's efforts in World War I. Over time, this limit on borrowing has been raised or suspended multiple times, as the US government has faced various financial challenges and the need to finance its activities. Step 4: Talk about why the debt ceiling is critical Illustrate the risks and consequences the country could face if it fails to raise or suspend the debt ceiling and is unable to pay its debts. Why the debt ceiling is critical: Failure to raise or suspend the debt ceiling would put the United States in a precarious financial position, potentially triggering a default on its obligations. This could lead to severe economic consequences, such as increased interest rates, a decline in the value of the US dollar, and a negative impact on the global economy. Step 5: Address why Washington is currently focused on the debt ceiling Discuss the current situation and the reasons behind the political discussions and debates on the debt ceiling in Washington. Why everyone in Washington is talking about it: Currently, the United States is nearing its debt ceiling, prompting heated political debate and negotiations among lawmakers. This is because raising the debt ceiling requires congressional approval, which often leads to conflict between political parties with differing fiscal priorities and goals. As both parties attempt to assert their agendas, the future of the country's financial health hangs in the balance, making this an issue of significant importance in the political sphere. Step 6: Conclusion Sum up the importance of understanding the debt ceiling and the implications it could have on the US economy. Conclusion: With the debt ceiling consistently featuring in political discourse, it is crucial for individuals to understand the concept and its potential consequences. Recognizing the functions and risks associated with the debt ceiling is essential for informed decision-making as the United States navigates its financial future amid competing political agendas."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:Have you ever wondered whether it’s worth your while to encourage an older person to start exercising? In 2014, the top-notch journal JAMA published the results of a fantastic research project: a study in which 1635 sedentary older adults (aged 70-89) were assigned to get either a structured exercise program, or a program of “successful aging” health education. The researchers called it the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) study. (You can read the full study here.) During the LIFE study, the two groups were followed for a little over 2.5 years. And by the end of the study, guess which group of volunteers was more likely to still walk a quarter of a mile (without a walker)? That’s right. When it came to avoiding “major mobility disability” — which the researchers defined as becoming unable to walk 400 meters or more — a structured exercise program was better than a program of healthy aging education. Specifically, the researchers found that 30% of the exercisers experienced a period of major disability, compared to 35.5% of the seniors enrolled in the healthy aging education program. This is a very encouraging finding! That said, it’s also a bit sobering to realize that even with exercise, almost 1 in 3 older adults experienced a period of limited mobility, of which half lasted 6 months or more. In this post, I’ll share some more details on this study, because the results provide a wonderful wealth of information that can be helpful to older adults, family caregivers, and even geriatricians such as myself.

With the exception of Parting Glances and Brokeback Mountain, there are few other notable American films with the kind of depth and sincerity as this movie, The Bubble. This movie centers on two men, Noam and Ashwar, an Israle and Palestinian respectively. Their relationship is complicated by the tension between the Jews and Arabs in Israel. Couples, in the early stages of their relationships will struggle with who will call who next, or who will say \\"I love you\\" first. Noam and Ashwar's early love is complicated by suicide bombings, armed security check points, and racism. While Noam's friends accept and like Ashwar, who is Arab, it is clear that most of Tel Aviv's citizens probably don't. One of the most touching moments, and there are many in this film, is when Noam and Ashwar attend a production of \\"Bent\\". We, as movie goers, see them watching this play, and the affect it has on the two of them is profoundly captured in their eyes. And ultimately, this touching moment is played out in a very sad way in the finale of the movie. Ohad Knoller and Youseff 'Joe' Sweid are outstanding as Noam and Ashwar. Director Eytan Fox is brilliant in creating a cogent and interesting retelling of the Shakespeare classic Romeo and Juliet. And while most movies today have sex in them, (almost as a sport), this one goes back to the old tried and true version of sex with love and passion combined. It is so refreshing. Also refreshing is seeing two gay men being portrayed as people and not cartoons. There are cartoonish characters in this movie. It just doesn't happen to be the two gay guys for a change.

Arsenal have opened talks with Theo Walcott over a second new contract in two years. Walcott made his first Arsenal appearance in 10 months following a serious knee injury, coming on as a late substitute in Saturday’s 3-0 win over Burnley. The England forward would enter the final year of his contract at the end of the season, a scenario Arsenal are keen to avoid, and they have held initial discussions regarding an extension. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Theo Walcott returns to Arsenal training ahead of Anderlecht. Theo Walcott, who made his injury comeback against Burnley, could be handed a new deal at Arsenal. Walcott is back in first-team training after recovering from a serious knee injury. Manager Arsene Wenger wants to pre-empt any uncertainty over Walcott’s future by signing him to a longer deal. Walcott ended a saga by signing a three-and-a-half-year extension in January 2013 worth around £90,000 per week. Just 38 appearances later, Walcott is on course for another. Wenger confirmed: ‘We are starting to sit down with him. He has one and a half years to go in December. It is never an easy job with him. 'It should be his best years from now because he is 25, so hopefully we can profit from that. ‘He is a unique player, a player who has been here a long time and who gives us something different. He has been tremendous for the last few seasons. To have him back can only be a bonus for me.’ Walcott could feature again from the bench in the Champions League clash against Anderlecht. The former Southampton man’s return to fitness comes as a huge boost to Wenger, who is without six first-teamers due to injury, including Mesut Ozil, Laurent Koscielny and Mathieu Debuchy. Despite Walcott’s lack of match fitness the Arsenal manager says he is happy for him to report for international duty next week ahead of England’s clashes against Slovenia and Scotland. ‘I’m happy for him to go with England, he needs competition and games,’ said the Frenchman. ‘For us, he needs hard training. Will I use him from the bench against Anderlecht? I haven’t decided yet.’ The Arsenal winger replaced Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, pictured, against Burnley on Saturday. Walcott will be hoping to feature against Anderlecht after coming on for the last 10 minutes at the weekend. Provided results go their way, Arsenal can secure their passage into the Champions League knockout stages with two games to spare by beating Anderlecht, but Wenger insists his side will not take their foot off the gas during the final two group games as they look to clinch top spot above Borussia Dortmund. Arsenal have finished second in their group in the previous two seasons, and both times they have been eliminated in the last 16 by Bayern Munich. In 2011 they also finished second and ran into a Lionel Messi-inspired Barcelona in the first knockout round. Wenger is determined to reduce the chances of meeting one of Europe’s superpowers in the next round by finishing top of the group. ‘Before, we played Bayern twice, we played Barcelona as well,’ said Wenger. ‘It is always better you finish first because in some way you feel guilty if you don’t finish first and you think, if you are punished, it is down to you because you finished second. ‘Let’s do the job against Anderlecht and then we will see. I believe every win makes you strong and every defeat makes you weaker, so no matter what happens we will try to play until the end. 'It will be satisfying for me to qualify after four games, it will be job done. We want to take that opportunity, we are on a good run and we want to take advantage of that.

It was in this event that the tech giant unveiled their plans for the next-generation portable media player, the Zune HD, focusing on its multimedia capabilities, touchscreen functionality, and a new user interface. The Zune HD Marketplace would offer a platform for users to access and purchase music, videos, podcasts, and apps specifically designed for the Zune HD device. The Marketplace aimed to compete with Apple's iTunes and iPod products, bringing a new outlook and expanding Microsoft's presence in the digital entertainment market. E3 2009, also known as the Electronic Entertainment Expo, was an event held at the Los Angeles Convention Center in June 2009 where Microsoft held a press conference to reveal further details about the Zune HD. During this press conference, more information about the device, its capabilities, and its integration into the Zune HD Marketplace was disclosed, generating excitement and anticipation among the consumers and tech enthusiasts. At the E3 conference, Microsoft emphasized on the Zune HD's impressive features, such as its NVIDIA Tegra processor, the OLED screen with multitouch support, HD radio tuner, and its compatibility with Xbox 360, allowing seamless streaming of content through a home network. Unfortunately, the Zune HD device and its marketplace were short-lived, as Microsoft decided to discontinue the Zune product line in 2011, shifting focus to its Windows Phone platform and integrating the music services in the form of what is now known as Groove Music and Movies & TV apps. In conclusion, the Zune HD Marketplace was initially announced at CES 2009, with further details unveiled during the Microsoft press conference at E3 2009."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: I've owned this CD since it came out over a year ago and I just decided to start posting reviews on this CD, among others. Lorrie has such a pure distinct voice that it's a shame she is without a doubt one of the most underrated country singers of all time. Sammy also has such a distinct voice and I find the two are able to pull off an amazing duet. So good, that a CD chocked full of duets was no problem for these two. 'He Drinks Tequila' obviously steals the album as far as the 'fun & fast' song goes while 'I Finally Found Someone' holds the 'slow ballad' of sorts top spot. Other lead songs include 3 Seconds, 29 Again, Sad City, Big Time, & Sugar. Overall, I rate it 4 out of 5 stars simply because Sammy's voice seems to be lacking in a few of the solo songs. It's a must have for either Sammy fans or Lorrie fans. Answer: Answer:","output":"The tone of this product review is mostly positive.

We have a problem that says 7*r = -8*r. Imagine you have 7 apples in one hand and then you multiply them by a mysterious number \\"r.\\" And in your other hand, you have -8 oranges, and you also multiply these by that same mysterious number \\"r.\\" What we need to do is find out the value of \\"r\\" that makes both sides equal. 1. Our first step is to bring all the \\"r\\" terms to one side. We have 7 apples in one hand and -8 oranges in the other, right? To make them equal, let's remove -8 oranges from both hands (just like sharing equally). We'll do that by adding 8*r to both sides. 7*r + 8*r = -8*r + 8*r 2. Now, let's see what happens when we combine both hands (add the apples and oranges together). We get: (7 + 8)*r =0 3. Great! Now we have 15*r = 0. Think of it this way: you have 15 apples in your hand and you want to share them equally among the \\"r\\" number of friends, how many apples does each friend get? 4. We find \\"r\\" by dividing 15 by itself: 15*r / 15 = 0 / 15 5. When we divide, we get: r = 0 So, the mysterious number \\"r\\" is 0!

Article: Running like the wind, roaring like thunder, tigers have long been feared and respected as a king of the animal world. But last week a report said that there are no more than 30 wild tigers left in south China. This was the conclusion of a team of scientists from China's State Forestry Administration and the World Nature Fund. The South China tiger, also known as the Chinese tiger, is native to southern China. In the 1950s, there were over 4,000 tigers found in mountain forests in the country. But due to the destruction of their natural habitat and uncontrolled hunting, it has been pushed on to the list of the world's top ten most endangered species.  Sixty-six of the big cats can be found in the cages of a dozen zoos around China. But they are nothing like their wild cousins. They have lost their natural skills such as hunting and killing. If they were set free they could not look after themselves. \\"Breeding has damaged the quality of the species,\\" said Pei Enle, deputy director of the Shanghai Zoo.  To reintroduce the species into the wild, the country started a programme to send five to ten young tigers to South Africa. Four of them have already arrived. Progress has been made as two elder tigers have recovered some of their instincts  and can hunt wild animals by themselves at the African base. \\"South Africans are very experienced in reintroducing big animals to the wild. The country has very good natural conditions for the tigers to learn in,\\" said Lu Jun, office director of the National Wildlife Research and Development Centre. \\"We tried in Fujian Province, but it was not successful as there was not a complete eco-chain   and there was a lack of space.\\" The tigers should return to China in 2009 when the reservations in Fujian are ready. Question: What is the purpose of sending young tigers to South Africa? - To help the tigers recover their ability to live in the wild. - To provide them with a better environment. - To get the tigers to go on a tour. - To find a complete eco-chain for them. Answer:","output":"The purpose of sending young tigers to South Africa is to help the tigers recover their ability to live in the wild.

Write a title for this article: Media empress Oprah Winfrey may get into yet another game: NBA ownership. According to ESPN, Winfrey is considering teaming with David Geffen and Larry Ellison for a bid to buy the Los Angeles Clippers from Donald Sterling, who is facing massive pressure to sell the franchise as part of sanctions stemming from his infamous racist rant. Sterling is heard on an audio recording scolding his girlfriend, V. Stiviano, for posting Instagram photos of herself with black acquaintances and for bringing them to Clippers games. Winfrey was outspoken in criticism, saying Sterling’s comments were indicative of a “plantation mentality,” though on Tuesday she had said, “I won’t be buying the Clippers.” NBA commissioner Adam Silver said Tuesday: “I fully expect to get the support I need from the other NBA owners to remove him.” Geffen and software billionaire Ellison were previously tipped as candidates to purchase the Clippers in bidding that may tick toward 800 million. Lakers great Magic Johnson, with financial backer Guggenheim Partners, also is considered a front-runner. The Clippers rank as the 13th most valuable team in the league, according to Forbes, at an estimated 575 million. But the team likely would sell for millions more, on the promise of a rich new cable TV contract. A sports investment banker told The Post’s Josh Kosman the Clippers could sell for as much as as the Nets, valued at 780 million.","output":"\\"Oprah Winfrey Explores NBA Ownership: A Potential Bid for the Los Angeles Clippers Amid Sterling Controversy\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c. , when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake. During this period, the indigenous people lived in caves, hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline. The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries. The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated. Fossils tell an obscure story of man's slow and sporadic development. Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture. By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas. These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River. The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife. Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis. For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization. Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley. Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest. This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society — the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife. Mysteriously, the Anasazi vanished from the valley around a.d.

Process:  - Food enters the small intestine - The small intestine produces hormones - The hormones cause the pancreas to produce enzymes for digestion - The enzymes travel from the pancreas to the small intestine through tubes - The enzymes help the intestines digest the food - The pancreas produces the hormones insuline and glucagon - The hormones control the amount of sugar in the blood.  suppose the person drinks more liquid happens, how will it affect the pancreas working SOFTER.  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process The answer to this question is:","output":"indirectly impacting a step of the process. When a person drinks more liquid, specifically water, it could have an indirect effect on the pancreas and its workings. The primary role of the pancreas is to produce digestive enzymes and release hormones like insulin and glucagon to maintain blood sugar levels. When a person drinks more liquid, it does not directly affect the pancreas or its production of enzymes and hormones. However, the indirect effects can come through changes in the composition, dilution, or volume of the fluids within the gastrointestinal tract. Increased fluid consumption can lead to the following indirect consequences for the pancreas: 1. Altered food digestion: Excessive fluid consumption could dilute digestive enzymes and gastric acid in the stomach, which could potentially slow down the breakdown of food. In response to this, the pancreas may need to produce more enzymes to compensate for the diluted enzymes so that digestion proceeds efficiently. Thus, the pancreas will need to work harder to produce more digestive enzymes. 2. Changes in nutrient absorption: Increased fluid intake may temporarily accelerate the passage of food through the small intestine. This could lead to suboptimal absorption of certain nutrients due to the faster transit time. The pancreas may need to increase its production of enzymes to maintain optimal digestion and absorption of nutrients. 3. Impact on blood sugar: Drinking large volumes of fluid can lead to increased urination, which could affect the body's overall glucose metabolism. The pancreas may need to adjust insulin and glucagon production to ensure blood sugar levels remain stable in the face of these fluid imbalances. In conclusion, drinking more liquid has the potential to indirectly impact the pancreas's functions, although it does not directly alter the steps of the pancreatic process. The possible perturbations involve altered food digestion, changes in nutrient absorption, and influence on blood sugar levels, which may require the pancreas to work harder to maintain optimal digestion and blood sugar levels."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Pockets (Red Buttons), driver of the catching car, tells Sean a tourniquet isn't doing any good to stop the bleeding, and so they head into town to take the Indian to the hospital while Kurt dives back to the compound to bring Brandy (Michèle Girardon), who technically owns Momella Game Ltd., to town to meet them.The credits play while Sean and the others are driving back.Kurt arrives at the compound in the evening and tells Brandy what happened while she dresses; they depart and join the others at the hospital where they all anxiously await news of the Indians fate. When a young Frenchman with a chip on his shoulder named Charles Maurey (Gérard Blain) comes up to them and asks Sean for the Indian's job, as he was afraid if he waited someone else would get it, the party reacts with indignation and Kurt knocks him down in anger. Sean separates them, and just then Doctor Sanderson (Eduard Franz) enters to tell them about the Indian. He sadly relates to them that the Indian needs a transfusion, but his blood type AB negative is very difficult to match, and the plasma is not doing the job. The Frenchman announces that his blood type is the same as the Indian's, but he will only give it if Kurt asks him. Kurt does, and Sean tells the Frenchman to come out to the compound afterwards, and they'll see about that job. The doctor asks them all to leave the hospital as they're only in the way.The party relocates to a bar where some time and several drinks later the doctor calls to inform them the Indian will be all right and should soon be on...

What is the best way to: How to Make a Peach Fuzz","output":"The Peach Fuzz is a delicious and refreshing cocktail made from peach schnapps, vodka, and orange juice. This drink is perfect for summer parties, barbecues, or simply enjoying on a warm day. Here is the best way to make a Peach Fuzz cocktail: Ingredients: - 2 oz peach schnapps - 1 oz vodka - 3 oz orange juice - Ice - Fresh peach slices (optional) - Orange wedge (optional) - Maraschino cherry (optional) Instructions: 1. Gather all your ingredients: To make the best Peach Fuzz, ensure you have all the necessary ingredients. Choose a high-quality peach schnapps and vodka for optimal taste. It's also advisable to use fresh-squeezed orange juice for the best flavor. 2. Prepare the glass: Start by selecting an appropriate glass for your Peach Fuzz. A highball or Collins glass works well. If desired, you can add a decorative touch to your glass by rimming the edge with sugar. Simply moisten the rim of the glass with a fresh orange wedge and dip it into granulated sugar. 3. Fill the glass with ice: Fill your glass to the top with ice cubes, ensuring that there's enough room for the cocktail mix. 4. Mix the cocktail: In a cocktail shaker or mixing glass, combine the peach schnapps, vodka, and orange juice. If you do not have a cocktail shaker, a mason jar with a lid or even a simple glass with a small plate on top can also work. Fill the shaker with some ice to help chill the mixture while shaking. 5. Shake or stir the cocktail: Cap your shaker or cover the mixing glass, and shake or stir the mixture vigorously for about 15-20 seconds. This helps to mix the ingredients thoroughly while also cooling down the cocktail. 6. Strain the cocktail: Place a strainer over the top of the glass with ice (if you used a shaker, it may have a built-in strainer). Pour the Peach Fuzz mixture into the ice-filled glass, straining to keep out the ice from the shaker. 7. Garnish and serve: For an attractive and tasty garnish, add a fresh peach slice, an orange wedge, and a maraschino cherry to the top of your Peach Fuzz. If you prefer, you can skewer the peach slice and cherry together, balance the garnish on the rim of the glass, or simply drop them into the cocktail. Enjoy your refreshing Peach Fuzz cocktail!

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Sri Aurobindo (Bengali: [Sri Orobindo]) (born Aurobindo Ghose; 15 August 1872 - 5 December 1950) was an Indian philosopher, yogi, guru, poet, and nationalist. He joined the Indian movement for independence from British rule, for a while was one of its influential leaders and then became a spiritual reformer, introducing his visions on human progress and spiritual evolution. Aurobindo studied for the Indian Civil Service at King's College, Cambridge, England. After returning to India he took up various civil service works under the maharaja of the princely state of Baroda and became increasingly involved in nationalist politics and the nascent revolutionary movement in Bengal. In July 1905 then Viceroy of India, Lord Curzon, partitioned Bengal. This sparked an outburst of public anger against the British, leading to civil unrest and a nationalist campaign by groups of revolutionaries, who included Aurobindo. In 1908, Khudiram Bose and Prafulla Chaki attempted to kill Magistrate Kingsford, a judge known for handing down particularly severe sentences against nationalists. However, the bomb thrown at his horse carriage missed its target and instead landed in another carriage and killed two British women, the wife and daughter of barrister Pringle Kennedy. Aurobindo was also arrested on charges of planning and overseeing the attack and imprisoned in solitary confinement in Alipore Jail. The trial of the Alipore Bomb Case lasted for a year, but eventually he was acquitted on May 6, 1909. His defence counsel was Chittaranjan Das.  During this period in the Jail, his view of life was radically changed due to spiritual experiences and realizations. Consequently, his aim went far beyond the service and liberation of the country.  Aurobindo said he was \\"visited\\" by Vivekananda in the Alipore Jail: \\"It is a fact that I was hearing constantly the voice of Vivekananda speaking to me for a fortnight in the jail in my solitary meditation and felt his presence.\\"  In his autobiographical notes, Aurobindo said he felt a vast sense of calmness when he first came back to India. He could not explain this and continued to have various such experiences from time to time. He knew nothing of yoga at that time and started his practise of it without a teacher, except for some rules that he learned from Ganganath, a friend who was a disciple of Brahmananda. In 1907, Barin introduced Aurobindo to Vishnu Bhaskar Lele, a Maharashtrian yogi. Aurobindo was influenced by the guidance he got from the yogi, who had instructed Aurobindo to depend on an inner guide and any kind of external guru or guidance would not be required.  In 1910 Aurobindo withdrew himself from all political activities and went into hiding at Chandannagar in the house of Motilal Roy, while the British were trying to prosecute him for sedition on the basis of a signed article titled 'To My Countrymen', published in Karmayogin. As Aurobindo disappeared from view, the warrant was held back and the prosecution postponed. Aurobindo manoeuvred the police into open action and a warrant was issued on 4 April 1910, but the warrant could not be executed because on that date he had reached Pondicherry, then a French colony. The warrant against Aurobindo was withdrawn. What stopped them?","output":"What stopped them was that Aurobindo went into hiding at Chandannagar in the house of Motilal Roy.

(October 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Five years after the first film, Crown Princess of Genovia Amelia \\"Mia\\" Thermopolis (Anne Hathaway) has just graduated from Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School and is returning to Genovia with her bodyguard Joe (HÃ©ctor Elizondo). There, she will await her reign once her grandmother, Queen Clarisse (Julie Andrews), steps down as Queen. During Mia's 21st birthday party, she dances with all the eligible bachelors in hope of finding a husband. She becomes attracted to a handsome gentleman named Nicholas (Chris Pine). During the course of the night, Mia's tiara falls off and is caught by Parliament member Viscount Mabrey (John Rhys-Davies) who secretly plans to steal Mia's crown. While the Parliament is in-session the next morning, Mia stumbles upon a hidden room that allows her to secretly listen in. Viscount Mabrey reveals his nephew, Lord Devereaux, is another heir to the Genovian throne. Despite Queen Clarisse's objection, the only way Mia can assume her duties as Queen is if she marries within the month. Clarisse invites Lord Devereaux to stay at the palace, while Mia is shocked to discover Lord Devereaux is Nicholas. Mia's best friend Lilly Moscovitz (Heather Matarazzo) surprises her by visiting. Together, they pick through potential husbands. Mia eventually chooses Andrew Jacoby (Callum Blue), Duke of Kenilworth and days later they are engaged. Mabrey plans to have Nicholas woo Mia and dissolve the engagement. For a ceremony, Mia is to ride sidesaddle but does not know how. Queen Clarisse provides an ancestral wooden leg decoy to make it look like she's riding sidesaddle. Mabrey spooks Mia's horse with a rubber snake and Joe rushes to Mia's aide, but accidentally tears off the wooden leg. Humiliated, Mia flees to the stables, where Nicholas fails to comfort her. At a garden party,... Answer:","output":"In \\"The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement,\\" Nicholas Devereaux, played by Chris Pine, tricks Mia Thermopolis, played by Anne Hathaway, into spending more time with him under the manipulative guidance of his uncle, Viscount Mabrey. Viscount Mabrey, who wants to get Lord Devereaux on the throne of Genovia, plans to have Nicholas woo Mia and dissolve her engagement with Andrew Jacoby, Duke of Kenilworth. Nicholas manipulates situations where he appears as a compassionate and charming person, making it hard for Mia to resist his charm. One example is when Mia suffers humiliation during a riding ceremony after being spooked by a rubber snake planted by Mabrey. Nicholas finds Mia in the stable and tries to comfort her, showing his seemingly sensitive side, in an attempt to get closer to her. As the movie progresses, Mia begins falling for Nicholas, jeopardizing her chances of becoming Queen if she were to break her engagement with Andrew Jacoby. However, it is essential to note that as Nicholas gets to know Mia, he starts to have genuine feelings for her and regrets his initial intentions of deceiving her. In conclusion, Nicholas tricks Mia by presenting himself as a sensitive and charming man to win her affection, all in an effort to weaken her engagement and potential claim to the throne. His actions are a critical part of the film's plot, contributing to the internal and external conflicts Mia has to overcome throughout the story."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sentence: \\"Susan did so the baker.\\" Would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically?","output":"A linguist would likely not rate the sentence \\"Susan did so the baker\\" as acceptable linguistically, as it lacks clarity and proper grammatical structure. In order for a sentence to be considered linguistically acceptable, it must adhere to the rules of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. Let's break down the sentence to understand its various shortcomings. 1. Syntax: Syntax refers to the rules governing the arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences in a language. In the sentence \\"Susan did so the baker,\\" the syntax seems off. The sentence appears to be missing a verb to provide a proper connection between \\"Susan\\" and \\"the baker.\\" For example, a syntactically correct sentence may read as, \\"Susan helped the baker.\\" 2. Semantics: Semantics is the study of meaning in language. It deals with the relationship between words, phrases, and the meaning they convey. In the sentence under consideration, it is unclear what \\"did so\\" exactly means. It would be more semantically clear if the sentence explained what Susan did. A semantically refined sentence might be, \\"Susan baked bread with the baker.\\" 3. Pragmatics: Pragmatics is concerned with understanding the intended meaning of a sentence beyond its literal meaning. It deals with how context influences comprehension. In the case of \\"Susan did so the baker,\\" the intended meaning is not evident, making it difficult to extract any context or purpose from the statement. A pragmatic representation of the sentence could be, \\"Susan assisted the baker in preparing the pastries for the event.\\" By addressing the syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic issues of the original sentence, we can create a more linguistically acceptable sentence, such as, \\"Susan assisted the baker in preparing the pastries for the event.\\" This version provides context, meaning, and proper structure that a linguist would consider acceptable."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In this scenario, the premise is: \\"Three males are walking across a field.\\" The hypothesis is: \\"Three males are walking across a green field.\\" To arrive at a detailed conclusion, let's analyze the premise and the hypothesis carefully. Premise: \\"Three males are walking across a field.\\" This statement simply tells us that there are three males walking across a field, with no additional information about the field's characteristics. The field could be of any color, size, or condition. Hypothesis: \\"Three males are walking across a green field.\\" Here, the statement includes a description of the field's color - it is green. Now let's evaluate the choices: (1). Yes - This means that the hypothesis must be true if the premise is true. The issue with this choice is that the premise doesn't provide us any information related to the color of the field. So, we cannot conclude that the field is green based on the premise alone. Thus, this option is incorrect. (2). It is not possible to tell - This choice implies that we cannot determine with certainty whether the hypothesis is true or not based on the premise. As the premise offers no information about the field's color, we can't confidently establish that the hypothesis is true. This option suggests a level of uncertainty, which is accurate in this case. (3). No - This selection implies that the hypothesis is false if the premise is true. However, the premise doesn't contradict the hypothesis. Neither does it confirm it. There is a possibility that the field is green, but the premise doesn't provide enough information to make such a conclusion. So, this option is also incorrect. Based on our analysis, the most appropriate choice is (2) \\"It is not possible to tell.\\" We cannot conclude if the hypothesis is true based on the premise because there isn't enough information about the field's color in the premise to support or refute the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the name of the waterway that connects the North Sea to the Atlantic Ocean via Loch Ness?","output":"The name of the waterway that connects the North Sea to the Atlantic Ocean via Loch Ness is the Caledonian Canal. This impressive canal stretches approximately 60 miles (97 kilometers) across northern Scotland, facilitating travel and transportation through a series of interconnected natural lakes and man-made channels between the two bodies of water. Designed by the renowned Scottish engineer Thomas Telford, the construction of the Caledonian Canal began in 1803 and was completed in 1822. The canal was primarily built as a response to the Napoleonic Wars, as it provided a safer and more efficient alternative route for shipping to bypass the hazardous waters along the northern coast of Scotland that were prone to attacks by pirates, storms, and hidden rocks. The Caledonian Canal is comprised of 29 locks, four aqueducts, and 10 bridges to manage the different water levels and to overcome elevation changes along the route. The iconic Loch Ness, famous for its mythical Loch Ness monster or \\"Nessie,\\" is one of the four natural freshwater lochs linked by the canal. The others are Loch Dochfour, Loch Oich, and Loch Lochy. From the eastern entrance at Inverness, the canal initially follows the course of the River Ness before reaching Loch Dochfour. It then continues through the famous Loch Ness, entering Loch Oich, and finally reaches Loch Lochy. At the southern end of Loch Lochy, the canal takes to man-made channels again and eventually emerges into the sea at Corpach, near Fort William, on the west coast of Scotland. In addition to its functionality in marine transportation and commerce, the Caledonian Canal has gained popularity as a key destination for leisure and recreation. It offers visitors and locals alike a wide range of activities, including boating, sailing, canoeing, fishing, and walking along the scenic towpaths. Furthermore, the canal and the Great Glen Way it traverses, both play a vital role in the local tourism industry, benefiting the economy and communities of the Highlands. In summary, the Caledonian Canal is a remarkable waterway connecting the North Sea to the Atlantic Ocean via Loch Ness. Its combination of historical engineering, natural beauty, and recreational opportunities continues to make it a significant location in Scotland's cultural and economic landscape."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Whitehall's disquiet at the failures of the RAF led to the replacement of Dowding (who was already due for retirement) with Sholto Douglas on 25 November. Douglas set about introducing more squadrons and dispersing the few GL sets to create a carpet effect in the southern counties. Still, in February 1941, there remained only seven squadrons with 87 pilots, under half the required strength. The GL carpet was supported by six GCI sets controlling radar-equipped night-fighters. By the height of the Blitz, they were becoming more successful. The number of contacts and combats rose in 1941, from 44 and two in 48 sorties in January 1941, to 204 and 74 in May (643 sorties). But even in May, 67% of the sorties were visual cat's-eye missions. Curiously, while 43% of the contacts in May 1941 were by visual sightings, they accounted for 61% of the combats. Yet when compared with Luftwaffe daylight operations, there was a sharp decline in German losses to 1%. If a vigilant bomber crew could spot the fighter first, they had a decent chance at evading it. Answer:","output":"The special aspect about the night fighters was that they were radar-equipped, which allowed them to be more successful during the Blitz. With the support of the GL carpet and GCI sets, these night-fighters saw an increase in the number of contacts and combats throughout 1941, leading to a higher success rate when compared to their previous performance."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Let say you have come up with 10 such keywords.","output":"Once you have brainstormed with industry experts and come up with 10 potential keywords for your website, there are several steps you can follow to refine your keyword list, analyze their potential, and strategically integrate them into your overall content plan. 1. Competitor Analysis: Research the websites of your top competitors and identify the keywords they are targeting. This will give you an idea of the most popular and relevant keywords in your market. You can use tools like SEMrush, Ahrefs, or Moz to analyze the keywords used by your competitors. 2.

This will help you prioritize your content creation and ensure a well-rounded content strategy. By covering a range of related topics, you will increase your chances of ranking well for multiple keywords. 5. Assess Keyword Intent: When analyzing and refining your keywords list, you should also assess the user intent behind each keyword. Are searchers looking for information, a solution to a problem, or a specific product? This understanding will help in crafting content that addresses the specific needs and intents of your target audience. 6. Content Creation: Use your keyword list to create high-quality content that goes beyond mere keyword-stuffing. Integrate your keywords naturally and strategically into your blog posts, articles, product descriptions, web pages, and other forms of content. Incorporate both short-form and long-form content to cater to different user preferences. 7. On-Page SEO: Optimize your website to include proper on-page SEO elements. This includes incorporating your focused keywords in title tags, meta descriptions, URL slugs, and header tags. Additionally, implement schema markup to better communicate with search engines and enhance your search result appearance. 8. Track Performance: Regularly analyze the performance of your website and the content using tools like Google Analytics, Google Search Console, and any other preferred analytics software. Keep track of organic search traffic, rankings for your target keywords, and other vital metrics. 9. Iteration: Based on your analytics and the performance of your content, make adjustments to your keyword targets and content strategy as needed. This ongoing process of keyword optimization and content refinement will ensure that you stay ahead of the competition. 10. Adopt New Keyword Trends: Finally, stay informed on emerging trends and popular topics in your industry. By keeping track of new developments, you can identify new keywords and niches early on, allowing you to create content that meets the growing demand. Conclusion: Finding the right keywords for your website is a crucial aspect of your SEO and content strategy. Use the methods mentioned above to generate an effective keyword list, analyze their potential, and incorporate them into high-quality, targeted content that will rank well in search engines and attract your target audience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: The world itself is becoming much smaller by using modern traffic and modern communication means . Life today is much easier than it was hundreds of years ago, but it has brought new problems. One of the biggest is pollution. To pollute means to make things dirty. Pollution comes in many ways. We see it, smell it, drink it and even hear it. Man has been polluting the earth. The more people, the more pollution. Many years ago, the problem was not so serious because there were not so many people. When the land was used up or the river was dirty in a place, men moved to another place. But this is no longer true. Man is now slowly polluting the whole world. Air pollution is still the most serious. It's bad to all living things in the world, but it is not only one kind of pollution. Water pollution kills fish and pollutes drinking water. Noise pollution makes us become angry more easily. Many countries are making rules to fight against pollution. They stop the people from burning coal in houses and factories in the city, and from blowing dirty smoke into the air. The pollution of SO2 is now the most dangerous problem of air pollution. It is mostly caused by heavy traffic. It is certain that if there are fewer people driving, there will be less air pollution. The earth is our home. We must take care of it. That means keeping the land, water and air clean. And we must try to control the growth of population at the same time. Question: Our world is becoming much smaller . Options: A: because the earth is being polluted day and night B: because science is developing C: because of the rise in population D: because the earth is blown away by the wind every year The answer is:","output":"B: because science is developing.  The statement \\"Our world is becoming much smaller\\" refers to the advancements in technology and communication that have made it easier for people to connect with each other and access resources and information around the globe. This process is a direct result of the development of science and technology, not because of pollution, population growth, or the earth being blown away by the wind. As mentioned in the article, modern traffic and communication means have contributed significantly to making the world feel smaller. Technological advancements like the internet, smartphones, and faster modes of transportation have all played a role in breaking down barriers and bridging distances between people and nations.  While pollution and the rise in population are mentioned as problems in the article, they do not directly contribute to the world becoming smaller. Pollution is identified as a critical issue that needs to be addressed, but it is a separate concern from the shrinking of the world due to technological advancements. Similarly, the rise in population can exacerbate pollution and resource scarcity, but it does not directly influence the world becoming smaller.  Finally, the option \\"D: because the earth is blown away by the wind every year\\" is not relevant to the context of the article and does not have any logical connection to the statement. In conclusion, the correct answer is option B: because science is developing, as it is the development of science and technology that has made the world feel smaller by facilitating faster and more efficient communication and transportation systems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But even as Trump and his Republican allies close in on the goal of passing tax reform, the Russia investigation continues to be a major distraction. The recent plea deal between Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and the office of special counsel Robert Mueller sent shockwaves around Washington and at the very least seemed to indicate the Russia probe is a long way from being completed. Trump is banking on a tax cut victory to shore up his political base and show supporters and detractors alike that he is a man of his word when it comes to delivering on his campaign promises. House and Senate negotiators are now working to resolve differences in the two versions with hopes of final votes in the coming weeks. But even if the tax plan is enacted into law, its impact is not likely to be felt for at least a year. And polls show the plan has less than majority support. Trump insists the tax cuts will lead to economic growth and more jobs. “I will tell you this is in a nonbraggadocio way,” Trump told supporters in Missouri recently. “There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished. That I can tell you.” Democrats oppose the tax plan but lack the votes to stop it. “It rewards the rich in terms of individuals and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle class families in our country,” warned House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Despite his poor standing in national polls, just less than 40 percent approval in most surveys, Trump’s base is largely sticking with him. The latest American Values Survey by the Public Religion Research Institute found that 84 percent of Republicans continue to back the president.

Dogen finds a murdered prospector, whose young daughter Dhyana saw him killed by Baal, Jared Syn's half-cyborg son. Baal sprayed the man with a green liquid that caused a nightmare dream-state, in which Syn appeared and executed him with a crystal. Dogen convinces Dhyana to help him find Syn. Dhyana takes Dogen to Zax, who identifies the crystal as a lifeforce storage device. Dhyana tells them about the ancient Cyclopians who once used such devices and says the only power against it is a magic mask located in their lost city. Zax affirms this and directs Dogen to find a prospector named Rhodes in the nearby mining town of Zhor. Dogen and Dhyana are blocked by vehicles driven by nomads commanded by Baal, who sprays Dogen with the green liquid, paralyzing him. Dhyana drives them off and cares for Dogen, who in the dream world finds Syn and Baal looming over him. Syn fails to pull Dogen away from Dhyana: their will is too strong. Dogen awakes, but Dhyana is suddenly teleported away. A summoned monster appears in her place and fires electric bolts at him. Dhyana simultaneously faces Syn in his lair.

Write down the given equation: -1443 * b = -1440 * b + 54 2. The primary goal is to isolate the variable b. To do that, we want to eliminate the term -1440 * b from the right side of the equation. We will add 1440 * b to both sides: (-1443 * b) + (1440 * b) = (-1440 * b) + (1440 * b) + 54 By adding these terms, we simplify the equation: -3 * b = 54 3. Now, we need to solve the equation for b. Since b is being multiplied by -3, we will divide both sides of the equation by -3: (-3 * b) / -3 = 54 / -3 By dividing the terms, we get: b = -18 So, the solution to the given linear equation is: b = -18"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Later I was told by a surgeon what I was experiencing was ‘textbook’ for the passing of blood clots through my occipital area of the brain! The feeling would eventually subside. I awoke one morning feeling ‘kind of fuzzy’ headed. Like I had slept too hard. I sat with my husband at the kitchen table for our morning coffee and newspaper and for no reason I could imagine I was unable to swallow my coffee and it dribbled out the left side of my mouth. My husband asked me what was going on and I apparently told him, I was ‘stroking’ out. He got up from the table assuming I was OK and went off to take his morning shower. While in the shower it occurred to him something might not be right. He came back to the table where I was struggling to lift myself from the chair. I put my hands on the table to lift my body and my left hand kept sliding off the edge. He finally got behind me and tried to lift me under my arms and I crumbled to the floor. He then called my OB and told him he thought I’d had a stroke. My OB immediately expressed his doubt but my husband was advised to call an ambulance to get me to the ER. I never really experienced pain from the stroke. Question: What is the name of the narrator's husband?

This transfers can be pivotal for a player's career and can significantly impact their success in the years to come. Such is the case for former Rangers midfielder Kyle Hutton, who recently inked a deal with Dumbarton after being released by St Mirren. A Promising Start at Rangers Born in Glasgow on February 6, 1991, Kyle Hutton had an illustrious start to his professional football career with Rangers F.C. His success as a promising young midfielder didn't go unnoticed, leading to his inclusion in the first team in 2010. During his time at Rangers, Hutton played under notable managers, such as Walter Smith and Ally McCoist, who were instrumental in guiding his development. The years spent learning from some of the best minds in the sport allowed him to cultivate his skills and understand the finer tactics of the game. Loan Spells and Move to St Mirren Despite his strong start and promising potential, Hutton eventually found himself loaned to various clubs in search of regular playing time. He had temporary stints with Partick Thistle, Dunfermline Athletic, Airdrie United, and Queen of the South, where he continued to gain valuable experience on the pitch. After leaving Rangers in 2015, Hutton joined St Mirren, seeking to establish himself as a dominant presence in the team's midfield. However, his time with the Buddies did not go quite as planned. Although he made numerous appearances, he never managed to lock down a regular starting position. Joining Dumbarton and Future Prospects After being released by St Mirren, Kyle Hutton was on the lookout for a new opportunity to reignite his footballing career. He found what he was looking for with Scottish League One side Dumbarton F.C., led by manager Jim Duffy. Signing Hutton is a significant coup for Dumbarton, who will benefit from the vast experience and leadership qualities he brings to midfield. Moreover, it showcases the club's ambitions to move up the league table and become a formidable force in Scottish football. For Hutton, it marks a fresh start, a chance to put past setbacks behind him and demonstrate his true worth. The seasoned midfielder will surely relish the opportunity to make a substantial impact in a team that clearly values and believes in his abilities. Conclusion In football, finding the right fit can make all the difference in a player's career trajectory. For Kyle Hutton, the journey from Rangers to Dumbarton has been a testament to his resilience, determination, and unwavering passion for the sport he loves. As he embarks on this new chapter with Dumbarton, fans of both the player and the club will be keenly watching to see if this move proves to be the catalyst for Hutton's resurgence as a force to be reckoned with in Scottish football.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  After graduation, Shostakovich initially embarked on a dual career as concert pianist and composer, but his dry style of playing was often unappreciated (his American biographer, Laurel Fay, comments on his \\"emotional restraint\\" and \\"riveting rhythmic drive\\"). He nevertheless won an \\"honorable mention\\" at the First International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw in 1927. He attributed the disappointment at the competition to suffering from appendicitis and the jury being all-Polish. He had his appendix removed in April 1927. After the competition Shostakovich met the conductor Bruno Walter, who was so impressed by the composer's First Symphony that he conducted it at its Berlin premiere later that year. Leopold Stokowski was equally impressed and gave the work its U.S. premiere the following year in Philadelphia and also made the work's first recording. Shostakovich concentrated on composition thereafter and soon limited his performances primarily to those of his own works. In 1927 he wrote his Second Symphony (subtitled To October), a patriotic piece with a great pro-Soviet choral finale. Owing to its experimental nature, as with the subsequent Third Symphony, it was not critically acclaimed with the enthusiasm given to the First. 1927 also marked the beginning of Shostakovich's relationship with Ivan Sollertinsky, who remained his closest friend until the latter's death in 1944. Sollertinsky introduced the composer to the music of Mahler, which had a strong influence on his music from the Fourth Symphony onwards. While writing the Second Symphony, Shostakovich also began work on his satirical opera The Nose, based on the story by Nikolai Gogol. In June 1929, against the composer's own wishes, the opera was given a concert performance; it was ferociously attacked by the Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians (RAPM). Its stage premiere on 18 January 1930 opened to generally poor reviews and widespread incomprehension among musicians.In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Shostakovich worked at TRAM, a...

This move showcases Hibernian's commitment to retain Allan despite continued interest from one of the country's top clubs. 1. Background of Rangers' Interest in Scott Allan Rangers have been keeping a close eye on Scott Allan due to his impressive performances for Hibernian since joining the club in 2014. Allan's excellent midfield skills and consistency in gameplay have caught the attention of Rangers, and they have been attempting to bring the player over to their team for quite some time now. 2. Previous Bids from Rangers This is not the first time Rangers have placed a bid to acquire Scott Allan. They have previously made two unsuccessful bids, and Hibernian has remained steadfast in their decision to not let go of their valued midfielder. Rangers' management, however, has not been deterred and has continued to express interest in signing Allan. 3. Hibernian's Firm Stance on Keeping Allan Hibernian manager Alan Stubbs has demonstrated unwavering support for Allan, repeatedly stating that the club has no intention of selling him. Stubbs believes that Allan is an integral part of the club's success and losing him would be a significant blow to the team. Consequently, Stubbs is ensuring that Allan remains with Hibernian and continues to contribute to their journey in Scottish football. 4. Implications of the Rejected Bid The rejection of this third bid from Rangers only heightens the tension between the two clubs, as Rangers may be feeling growing frustration with Hibernian's refusal to negotiate. This could potentially lead to an even more substantial bid from Rangers in an attempt to secure Allan's transfer. However, it also demonstrates Hibernian's determination to maintain their player despite the lucrative offers they are receiving. 5. Future Possibilities for Scott Allan With three bids rejected, it remains uncertain how Rangers' pursuit of Scott Allan will unfold in the future. If Rangers continue to intensify their efforts, it could put pressure on Hibernian to reconsider their stance on keeping Allan. However, the player's future will ultimately be determined by the decisions of both clubs and the outcome of ongoing negotiations. Conclusion In summary, Hibernian manager Alan Stubbs has confirmed that the club has rejected a third bid from Rangers for their star midfielder Scott Allan. This move highlights the club's unwavering commitment to retaining Allan, despite the strong interest from one of the top Scottish football clubs. As Rangers remain persistent in their pursuit, the future of both clubs and the player remains uncertain."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The answer to this question is:","output":"The customer appears to be dissatisfied with the Lotion Pump Dispenser. Although the customer does not explicitly state their overall satisfaction level, we can deduce their discontent from the context and issues raised in the review. First, the issue with the screw-on cap being too large indicates that the product did not meet the customer's specific needs for their intended use. This misfit between their expectations and the dispensers' design leads to functional dissatisfaction, which renders the product virtually useless for the customer. Second, the reviewer mentioning that the dispenser will remain in storage until they find a larger bottle implies that they have not been able to use the product yet. Additionally, the need to purchase another item (a larger bottle) to make the dispenser functional indicates inconvenience and added expenses for the customer. In most cases, this could lead to a negative experience and dissatisfaction with the product. Lastly, the fact that the customer decided to leave a review highlighting the issue with the screw-on cap size suggests that they were disappointed enough to share their experience with others. This public expression of disappointment and unmet expectations can be interpreted as an indication of dissatisfaction. In conclusion, based on the context and details provided in the review, it is reasonable to infer that the customer's experience with the Lotion Pump Dispenser was a dissatisfying one, primarily due to the mismatch between the dispensers' design and the customers' intended use. The need to store the product and potentially purchase additional items exacerbates this dissatisfaction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Deveraux finds his leader Andrew Scott (Dolph Lundgren), who has gone insane, with a string of severed ears and holding a young boy and girl hostage. Devereaux, who is near the end of his tour of duty, tries to reason with Scott, who shoots the boy and orders Devereaux to shoot the girl to prove his loyalty. Deveraux refuses and tries to save the girl, but Scott kills her with a grenade. The two soldiers shoot each other to death. Deveraux and Scott's corpses are recovered by a second squad and cryo-genically frozen, their deaths covered up as \\"missing in action\\". Deveraux and Scott are revived without memories of their previous lives and are selected for the \\"Universal Soldier\\" program, an elite counter terrorism unit, and are deployed via an Aero Spacelines Mini Guppy to the Hoover Dam to resolve a hostage situation.

It took 14 years to rebuild, mostly using original stones. More than a dozen of Banja Luka's mosques were destroyed during the war. The Bosnian Serb authorities say the re-opening demonstrates their commitment to ethnic tolerance. The mosque was blown up 23 years ago, at the height of  the Yugoslav civil war when Bosnian Muslims (Bosniaks), Croats and other non-Serbs were expelled from their homes in a tactic known as ethnic cleansing. Known as the Ferhadija, the mosque was rebuilt after architects managed to recover about two-thirds of the original stone and use plans drawn up when an earthquake damaged it in the 1960s. Saturday's re-opening took place amid tight security, with about 1,000 police officers patrolling the streets as buses arrived with Muslims from across the country. Traffic was barred from the city centre and alcohol consumption was banned. Turkey financed part of the rebuilding and outgoing Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu re-opened the mosque in front of a congregation of about 10,000 people. He said the new building sent a message of peace. \\"Bosnia-Herzegovina, with its Muslims, Catholics, Orthodox and Jews, is one body, one heart. If there is any attempt to split it up, it means that this one heart would be split,\\" he said in an apparent reference to secessionist threats by Bosnian Serbs. Bosnia's Grand Mufti, Hussein Kavazovic, called the re-opening \\"a joyous day for all\\". Banja Luka's Orthodox and Catholic bishops added their congratulations - while the president of Bosnia's Jewish community said the co-operation showed how people should live in the region. The re-opening was also welcomed by the UN and the EU. At least 100,000 people in total died during fighting in the the Bosnian war. The conflict lasted nearly four years before a US-brokered peace deal brought it to an end in 1995. Banja Luka is the capital of the Republika Srpska - one of two entities comprising Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is estimated that now only about 10% of Banja Luka's pre-war Muslim and Croat population remain in the city.

Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Hemophilia is a group of diseases in which blood does not clot normally. Factors in blood are involved in clotting. When you bleed, your body begins a coagulation cascade of reactions, involving special proteins known as coagulation factors, to stop that bleeding. When one or more of these clotting factors are missing, there is a higher chance of having dificulties stoping the bleeding. Hemophiliacs lacking the normal Factor VIII are said to have Hemophilia A (or Factor VIII deficiency), the most common form. Hemophilia is a genetic disease, passed down through family. It is linked to the X-chromosome, so it mostly affects males. F8 is the gene for the Factor VIII protein. Mutations in the F8 gene lead to the production of an abnormal version of coagulation factor VIII, or reduce the amount of the protein. The altered or missing protein cannot participate effectively in the blood clotting process.   Q: What is the term for diseases in which blood does not clot normally?   A: Answer:","output":"The term for diseases in which blood does not clot normally is Hemophilia. Hemophilia is a group of hereditary genetic disorders that impair the body's ability to create blood clots, a process which is needed to stop bleeding. This is caused by the deficiency of specific coagulation factors in the blood - special proteins that play a crucial role in blood clotting. These factors work in a specific sequence, known as the coagulation cascade, to form a clot and stop bleeding. Interestingly, when one or more of these clotting factors are deficient or missing, the coagulation cascade cannot function properly, causing prolonged or excessive bleeding. There can be different types of hemophilia, defined by the specific coagulation factor that is missing. For instance, Hemophilia A, the most common form of the disease, is caused by a deficiency in Factor VIII. This deficiency arises due to mutations in the F8 gene - the gene responsible for the production of Factor VIII protein. These mutations either lead to the production of an abnormal version of coagulation factor VIII or diminish the amount of the protein. As a result, the affected person's blood has difficulty clotting effectively, which can lead to prolonged bleeding after injury. Hemophilia is a genetic condition usually inherited from parents to their children and is linked to the X-chromosome. Because of this, it predominantly affects males. Nonetheless, it's crucial to note that the severity of hemophilia can vary from mild to severe, depending on the level of the clotting factors in the blood."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While Ferdie is hiding a hunter and two of his hunting dogs come and try to kill little Ferdie and Ferdie is running as fast as possible until he is out of breath and starts panting. While the hunter is firing gunshots towards Ferdie Casper notices they are trying to kill him and flies in the hunter's direction and pleads that the hunter leaves Ferdie alone.

Eliminated. - Farm: A farm is typically a large area of land with ample space for both people and animals. However, the question specifically states that the person can only have a small dog, and farms are known to be home to larger animals and bigger open spaces. While it is not impossible for someone with a small dog to live on a farm, it is not the best option given the context.

A period of instability followed the death of Emperor Henry V (r. 1111–25), who died without heirs, until Frederick I Barbarossa (r. 1155–90) took the imperial throne.

Given the question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What statue was nickmamed Old Flo? , can you please find it?   In December 2005, the two ton Reclining Figure (1969–70) – insured for £3 million – was lifted by crane from the grounds of the Henry Moore Foundation on to a lorry and has not been recovered. Two men were jailed for a year in 2012 for stealing a sculpture called Sundial (1965) and the bronze plinth of another work, also from the foundation's estate. In October 2013 Standing Figure (1950), one of four Moore pieces in Glenkiln Sculpture Park, estimated to be worth £3 million, was stolen. In 2012, the council of the London Borough of Tower Hamlets announced its plans to sell another version of Draped Seated Woman 1957–58, a 1.6-tonne bronze sculpture. Moore, a well-known socialist, had sold the sculpture at a fraction of its market value to the former London County Council on the understanding that it would be displayed in a public space and might enrich the lives of those living in a socially deprived area. Nicknamed Old Flo, it was installed on the Stifford council estate in 1962 but was vandalised and moved to the Yorkshire Sculpture Park in 1997. Tower Hamlets Council later had considered moving Draped Seated Woman to private land in Canary Wharf but instead chose to \\"explore options\\" for a sale. In response to the announcement an open letter was published in The Guardian, signed by Mary Moore, the artist's daughter, by Sir Nicholas Serota, Director of the Tate Gallery, by filmmaker Danny Boyle, and by artists including Jeremy Deller. The letter said that the sale \\"goes against the spirit of Henry Moore's original sale\\" of the work. The answer is:","output":"The statue nicknamed Old Flo is \\"Draped Seated Woman 1957–58,\\" a 1.6-tonne bronze sculpture by Henry Moore."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Tips from local residents helped Coalition forces envelop a village southwest of Mosul that is reportedly a hideout for AQI facilitators and smugglers coming in from Syria . Fifteen suspects were detained . Give answer the following question using evidence from the above passage: Why were Coalition forces targeting the man ?","output":"In the given passage, Coalition forces in Mosul targeted a man because they believed he was responsible for overseeing financial operations for Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) in the Ninawa province. Targeting this individual was likely a part of a broader strategy to dismantle AQI's financial and operational networks, which would weaken the organization's capacity to carry out acts of terror and undermine its influence in the region. There were multiple operations mentioned in the passage, with some resulting in the detention of eight suspects, including the one believed to be involved in AQI's financial operations. In another operation, seven additional suspects were detained, targeting an AQI senior leader. This further emphasizes the Coalition forces' efforts to disrupt AQI's leadership and organizational structure. Furthermore, the passage indicates that local residents played a crucial role in aiding Coalition forces. Tips from residents helped the forces envelop a village southwest of Mosul, which was reportedly a hideout for AQI facilitators and smugglers coming in from Syria. As a result, fifteen suspects were detained in this village. This exemplifies how cooperation between local communities and Coalition forces contributes to the fight against AQI and its network in the region. In conclusion, Coalition forces targeted the man in Mosul because they believed he played a significant role in AQI's financial operations in Ninawa province. By disrupting the financial capabilities and targeting the leadership of AQI, Coalition forces aim to weaken the organization's capacity to carry out acts of terror and diminish its presence and influence in the region. Additionally, the passage highlights the importance of cooperation between local residents and Coalition forces, as the information they provide can dramatically impact the effectiveness of anti-terrorism efforts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:This article: Brougham Castle (pronounced ) is a medieval building about 2 miles (3.2 km) south-east of Penrith, Cumbria, England. The castle was founded by Robert I de Vieuxpont in the early 13th century. The site, near the confluence of the rivers, Eamont and Lowther, had been chosen by the Romans for a Roman fort called Brocavum. The castle is scheduled as an Ancient Monument, along with the fort, as \\"Brougham Roman fort and Brougham Castle\\".In its earliest form, the castle consisted of a stone keep, with an enclosure protected by an earthen bank and a wooden palisade. When the castle was built, Robert de Vieuxpont was one of the only lords in the region who were loyal to King John. The Vieuxponts were a powerful land-owning family in North West England, who also owned the castles of Appleby and Brough. In 1264, Robert de Vieuxpont's grandson, also named Robert, was declared a traitor, and his property was confiscated by Henry III. Brougham Castle and the other estates were eventually returned to the Vieuxpont family, and stayed in their possession, until 1269, when the estates passed to the Clifford family through marriage. With the outbreak of the Wars of Scottish Independence, in 1296, Brougham became an important military base for Robert Clifford, 1st Baron de Clifford. He began refortifying the castle: the wooden outer defences were replaced with stronger, more impressive stone walls, and a large stone gatehouse was added. The importance of Brougham and Robert Clifford was such that, in 1300, he hosted King Edward I of England at the castle. Robert's son, Roger Clifford, was executed as a traitor, in 1322, and the family estates passed into the possession of King Edward II of England, although they were returned once his son Edward III became king. The region was often at risk from the Scots, and in 1388, the castle was captured and sacked. contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who hosted King Edward I at a castle?, what is it ? A:","output":"The full name of the person who hosted King Edward I at Brougham Castle is Robert Clifford, 1st Baron de Clifford."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"Upon reading this review, it would decrease the chances of me buying the product. Here are my step-by-step thoughts and justification: 1. The review title states \\"Disappointing, I expected more.\\" This immediately sets a negative tone and highlights that the reviewer felt let down by the book. 2. The reviewer mentions a personal connection with the subject matter (post-war Germany), implying they have a strong knowledge and understanding of the topic. This could indicate that their expectations were higher than someone without that connection. 3. The reviewer criticizes the book for having a superficial and empty portrayal of the protagonist's inner struggle. This suggests that the book may not offer a deep or nuanced exploration of the characters and their experiences. 4. The fact that the reviewer considered the possibility of translation errors shows that they were trying to understand the reasons for their disappointment and did not immediately dismiss the book. 5. The reviewer's parents, who also have direct experience with the subject matter, shared the same negative opinion of the book. This further confirms the sense that the book may not provide the depth or perspective that the reviewer was hoping for. 6. Despite the book being a quick read, the fact that the reviewer felt nothing by the end of it indicates a lack of emotional impact and overall dissatisfaction with the book. Based on these points, the review would make me less likely to purchase the product, as it highlights a lack of depth, emotional impact, and authenticity in portraying the subject matter."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Northern Lights Academy, in Hartlepool, Teesside, has a TV and sound studio, a computer suite, two dance studios and a 200-seat theatre. However, the Headland Development Trust which ran it collapsed in 2012. Hartlepool Borough Council said it is trying to find groups to take on the facility and has spent about £50,000 mothballing the building. Mark Patton, the local authority's assistant director for education, learning and skills, said it would be \\"a crying shame\\" if the building was not used. \\"At the time there was clearly a view from central government that things were in place to make it happen,\\" Mr Patton said. \\"There is a clear potential here now and we have to work collectively to do something about that.\\" The facility was funded by the Department for Education, which said \\"all necessary checks were taken by the Big Lottery Fund\\" which administrated the £4.5m on behalf of the government. The scheme was intended to provide space for young people and help tackle anti-social behaviour by enabling them to re-engage them with their communities. Children's services committee chairman Alan Clark said the facility \\"will have to be self-sustainable because the council doesn't have the resources to fund this building\\". St Hild's Church of England School, on whose site the academy was constructed, looked after the building on a short-term basis before the council took over, but the school does not have any liability for the scheme.

Context: U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday blasted former FBI director James Comey as an \\"untruthful slime ball,\\" and said it was his \\"great honor\\" to fire him.  Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week.  The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey.  The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles.  Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book.  Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump... Question: When did Comey write his book?

She did not like her ugly colour. She was attracted by the colour of the lake near her home. It was as blue as the sky after a storm. Bluebird wanted to be the colour of that beautiful lake very much. Flapping her wings one morning, Bluebird flew from her tree to the blue lake. Then she bathed in the water three times. After each bath, she sang, \\"Blue water. Still water. I went in. I am blue.\\" Bluebird repeated this every morning. On the third day, she came out of the lake with beautiful blue feathers. Now Coyote was a trickster --and hungry too. He stayed behind Bluebird's tree for a long time every day and watched her go to the lake. He pretended  to be interested in everything she did. He wanted Bluebird for lunch, but he was afraid of the blue water. On the third morning, Coyote saw Bluebird come out of the lake with beautiful blue feathers. Impressed, he sat next to Bluebird's tree and waited for her. When she returned, he asked, \\"How did you get blue feathers? I want to be blue like the mountains too.\\" Bluebird didn't believe Coyote, but she taught him how to bathe three times each morning and how to sing her song. Coyote did what she said, and after three days of bathing in the lake, his white fur turned deep blue. Convinced  that blue fur was even more beautiful than blue feathers, Coyote forgot all about being hungry. He ran as fast as he could to the top of the hill. Standing on his back legs, he raised his front legs off the ground and howled. But Coyote slipped  and rolled down the hill. He couldn't stop himself, and the dust and dirt covered his new blue fur.

This article: Sherman McCoy is a Wall Street bond trader who makes millions while enjoying the good life and the sexual favors of Maria Ruskin, a Southern belle gold digger. Sherman and Maria are driving back to Maria's apartment from JFK Airport when they take a wrong turn on the expressway and find themselves in the \\"war-zone\\" of the South Bronx. They are approached by two black youths after Sherman gets out of the car to move a tire out of the road. Sherman jumps back into the car and Maria guns the engine in reverse, running over one of the teenagers. The two drive away. Sherman initially wants to report the incident to the police, but Maria immediately talks him out of it, fearing that their affair would be publicly exposed. Meanwhile, alcoholic journalist Peter Fallow, anxious for a story to make good with his editor, comes upon the hit-and-run case as a rallying point for the black community calling upon Jewish district attorney Abe Weiss, who is the Bronx District Attorney seeking re-election. According to Judge Leonard White, almost all of DA Weiss' prosecutions end up with black and Puerto Rican defendants going to prison and Weiss is seeking a white defendant for purposes of convincing the minority-majority community that he is worth re-electing. Weiss recognizes the press coverage inherent in prosecuting the callow Sherman, who has been discovered as the owner of the car, and therefore presumed to be the hit-and-run driver, in order to cultivate the image as an avenger for the minorities and be propelled to the mayorship of New York City. As Sherman is brought to his knees, New York City fragments into different factions who use the case to suit their own cynical purposes. contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person Weiss wants to prosecute?, what is it ?

In the town of Glipforg, Lem is a teenager with a new part-time job at the local planetarium and a long-time crush on his neighbor, Neera. His best friend is Skiff, a big fan of the Humaniacs films. Lem tries to ask Neera on a date, but her hippie friend, Glar, keeps interrupting with his protest songs. A mysterious spacecraft goes into orbit around Planet 51 and sends out a signal. On Planet 51, under a secret Army installation called Base 9 (their version of Area 51), there is a basement filled with Earth artifacts including robotic satellites launched by the United States and the Soviet Union. The spacecraft's signal activates Rover, a wheeled A.I. probe. Rover escapes, following a program to locate the newly arrived astronaut. The Planetary Army becomes suspicious after Rover's escape and begins to investigate. The spacecraft touches down in Lem's backyard; NASA astronaut Charles \\"Chuck\\" T. Baker emerges. As Chuck plants the United States flag, he steps on a \\"rubber ducky\\" someone left on the ground. Everyone stares, and Chuck tries to get back into his module.

How to make a lava lamp with household ingredients  Rinse out a large soda or water bottle.  Any tightly sealable container works, but you probably have an empty water bottle laying around somewhere. Try to find one that holds at least 16 ounces or 500 milliliter, so you can clearly see the display. pick from the following.  a). Fill the bottle a third of the way with water. Have a bottle on the kitchen counter and a large weight book on the table.  b). In this article, the most common places you could find a lava lamp are under the bathtub, under a sink (if there's one), or even in your backyard. Cut one half of the soda to size in the bottle.  c). The larger you keep the glass, the more grainy the lip of the bottle. Measure out about 1/2 a gallon (1.9 liters) of soda.  d). This method is safe for kids to follow on their own, and much faster and easier than making a permanent lava lamp. Young kids can ask an adult to do the pouring for them. Answer:","output":"d). This method is safe for kids to follow on their own, and much faster and easier than making a permanent lava lamp. Young kids can ask an adult to do the pouring for them. Explanation: Option (a) is incorrect because it only involves filling the bottle with water, which is not the main ingredient to create a lava lamp effect. Mentioning a large weight book on the table is also unrelated to the task. Option (b) is incorrect because it talks about the possible locations of a lava lamp, which is not relevant to the next step in making one. Also, cutting one half of the soda to size in the bottle doesn't make sense in this context. Option (c) is incorrect because using soda as an ingredient doesn't create a lava lamp effect.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the first name of the descendant of Robert Campbell? ?  The area now called Yarralumla is part of two original land grants, which were granted to free settlers for the establishment of farms. In 1828 Henry Donnison, a Sydney merchant who had arrived with his wife and family on the brig Ellen on 29–30 July 1828, was granted an allotment on the western side of Stirling Ridge. A second grant was made to William Klensendorlffe (a German who had served in the British Navy and arrived free in the Colony in 1818), who had bought the land from John Stephen, on 7 March 1839. Donnison's land was named Yarralumla in a survey of the area conducted in 1834. Yarralumla was a name for the area used by the local people, apparently meaning \\"echo\\". An area to the west of what is now the suburb was the Yarrolumla parish.The prominent New South Wales parliamentarian Sir Terence Aubrey Murray (1810–1873) purchased Yarralumla in 1837. He lived there with his wife Mary Murray (née Gibbes, 1817–1858), the second daughter of the Collector of Customs for NSW, Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787–1873), MLC. In 1859, Murray sold Yarralumla to his brother-in-law, Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes (1828–1897). Later that same year, Augustus' parents came to live with him at Yarralumla homestead. Augustus Gibbes improved the estate and acquired additional land by purchase and lease. However, In 1881, he sold Yarralumla for 40,000 pounds to Frederick Campbell, a descendant of Robert Campbell, in order to travel overseas. Frederick Campbell erected a new, three-storey, brick house on the site of the former Yarralumla homestead at the beginning of the 1890s. Campbell's house would later form the basis of what is now the Governor-General of Australia's official Canberra residence, known colloquially as \\"Yarralumla\\" or \\"Government House\\". Campbell also built a large wooden woolshed nearby in 1904. It remains standing to this day.In 1908, the Limestone Plains area, including Yarralumla, was selected as the site for the capital city of the newly established Commonwealth of Australia.

Jackass is an American reality series, originally shown on MTV from 2000 to 2002, featuring people performing various dangerous, crude, self-injuring stunts and pranks. The show served as a launchpad for the television and acting careers of Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, and Steve-O, who previously had only minor acting roles. The show later sparked several spin-offs including Wildboyz, Viva La Bam, Homewrecker, Bam's Unholy Union, and Dr. Steve-O as well as three feature films distributed by MTV corporate sibling Paramount Pictures. Jackass sparked considerable amounts of controversy, as it was seen as indecent and encouraging of dangerous behavior. The show developed from Big Brother Magazine, a skateboarding-related humor magazine that Jeff Tremaine, Dave Carnie, Rick Kosick and Chris Pontius all worked for, and featured regular contributions from Johnny Knoxville and Dave England, among others. The concept of Jackass dates back to 1998, when failing-actor-turned-writer Johnny Knoxville thought of the idea of testing different self-defense devices on himself as the basis for an article. He pitched the idea to a couple of magazines and was turned down until meeting with Jeff Tremaine of Big Brother. Tremaine hired him as a journalist and convinced Johnny to videotape this idea and other stunts for stories. The footage, which involved Knoxville being tasered, maced, and shot while wearing a bulletproof vest, appeared in the second Big Brother skateboarding movie: Number 2. Future Jackass castmember Wee-Man made an appearance in the videos as well.  During this time, Bam Margera released a movie titled Landspeed:CKY, consisting of himself and his friends, which he dubbed the \\"CKY Crew\\", in West Chester, Pennsylvania, performing various skits and stunts. The Crew included the colorful cast of Ryan Dunn, Brandon Dicamillo, and Raab Himself, as well as Margera's family April, Phil, Don Vito, and Jess Margera. Tremaine saw the tapes and drafted Margera and his crew into what would become the cast of Jackass. Later, the Jackass crew would recruit Steve-O in a Florida flea market where he worked as a clown. To round out the cast, England brought in his friend Ehren McGhehey, a fellow Oregon resident and extreme stunt participant. Preston Lacy would be the last of what is now considered the main cast to join, auditioning midway through the show's run by eating four bananas with the peels on.  Tremaine drafted his friend, director Spike Jonze, to get involved with the show, and together, he, Jonze, and Knoxville served as executive producers. The show idea was pitched, and the cast was initially given an offer by Saturday Night Live to perform the stunts weekly for the show, though the offer was turned down. A bidding war occurred between Comedy Central and MTV, which MTV eventually won. It was then that Jackass was born. What year did the shows start?","output":"The Jackass show started in the year 2000."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

I will provide a detailed explanation of muscle to address both questions. A muscle is a soft tissue in the body of humans and animals that has the functionality to contract and produce force and movement. Muscles are made up of muscle fibers, which are long, multinucleated cells. These fibers are bundled together by connective tissue, forming a muscle. The human body has more than 600 muscles, which make up roughly 40% of the body weight. Muscles can be classified into three main types based on their structure and function: 1. Skeletal muscle: This type of muscle is attached to bones by tendons, which are strong connective tissues. Skeletal muscles are responsible for voluntary movement and the maintenance of posture and skeletal stability. These muscles are striated, meaning their cells have a repetitive pattern of light and dark bands, which is associated with the presence of actin and myosin filaments. Skeletal muscles are also considered multinucleated, meaning that they have multiple nuclei in a single cell. 2. Smooth muscle: This type of muscle is present in the walls of internal organs and structures like blood vessels, stomach, intestines, and the reproductive system. They are responsible for involuntary movements and functions such as controlling the diameter of blood vessels, the movement of food through the digestive system, and contracting the uterus during childbirth. Smooth muscle cells are spindle-shaped and have a single nucleus in each cell. They are non-striated, as they do not have the distinct banding pattern seen in skeletal muscles. 3. Cardiac muscle: This specialized muscle is found in the walls of the heart and is responsible for the heart's contractile function, which pumps blood throughout the body. Similar to skeletal muscles, cardiac muscles are striated and multinucleated, but they have their intrinsic rhythm and pace, which means that the contractions occur without requiring neural stimulation. They are also interconnected through structures called intercalated disks, which support synchronized contractions and rapid transmission of electrical impulses throughout the heart muscle. In summary, a muscle is a soft tissue found in the human body and animals responsible for generating movement and force by contracting its cells. There are three main types of muscles, namely skeletal muscles, smooth muscles, and cardiac muscles, each with its unique structure and function."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Kitano explains that the class has been chosen to participate in the annual Battle Royale as a result of the BR Act, which was passed after 800,000 students walked out of school. A cheerful orientation video instructs the class they have three days to kill each other until only one remains. The explosive collars will kill any uncooperative students or those within daily \\"danger zones\\". Kitano kills two students, Fumiyo Fujiyoshi and Yoshitoki Kuninobu (Shuya's best friend), for misbehavior during the video. Each student is provided a bag of food and water, map of the island, compass, and a weapon ranging in efficiency from firearms to a paper fan. The program's first six hours see twelve deaths, four by suicide. Mitsuko Souma and mute transfer student Kazuo Kiriyama soon become the most dangerous players, while another transfer student, Shogo Kawada, seems somewhat more merciful. Shinji Mimura plots to hack into the military's computer system. Amid shifting loyalties and violent confrontations, Shuya promises to keep Noriko safe, because his friend secretly loved her. Shuya carries Noriko to a clinic after she collapses, where they encounter Kawada, who reveals that he won a previous Battle Royale at the cost of his girlfriend, whose death he seeks to avenge. When Kiriyama attacks, Shuya entrusts Kawada to protect Noriko and runs off as a distraction. Although saved by Hiroki Sugimura, he is wounded. Shuya awakens in the island's lighthouse, bandaged by female class representative Yukie Utsumi, who has a crush on him.

About 1,000 people yesterday descended on Nakoso beach, about 40miles south of the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant, where three reactors melted down after the March 11, 2011 earthquake and tsunami. The opening was celebrated with beach volleyball games and hula dancers from a nearby spa. A family plays on Nakoso Beach in Iwaki in Japan's Fukushima state. The beach is the first to be opened to the public since the nearby nuclear power station meltdown following the earthquake and tsunami of March 2011. Playtime: About 1,000 people yesterday descended on Nakoso beach, about 40miles south of the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant. Iwaki city official Joji Kimura said negligible radiation was detected in water at the beach. Airborne radiation was measured at 0.08 microsieverts an hour, far below dangerous levels. Swimming had been banned at all beaches in the state since the disaster last March. The opening took place on the same. day that the Japanese government came under fire over its handling of. public hearings on nuclear energy policy. The criticism threatens to dent already sagging support for the ruling party ahead of an election many expect to be this year. The latest furore follows Monday's massive rally in Tokyo against nuclear power in the wake of the Fukushima disaster. Local officials and analysts say the. issue is now so contentious that it could trump taxes as the focus of. lower house elections, which must be held by September 2013 but could. come sooner. News that power company employees. were among the few chosen to speak at hearings on changes to energy. policy after Fukushima, the world's worst atomic disaster in 25 years, have been greeted with widespread scepticism. On duty: Three local women working as tour guides enter the water in front of a gaggle of photographers and cameramen. Mass demonstrations: Anti-nuclear energy protesters march through Tokyo on Monday. Fun times: An anti-nuclear protester dressed as a clown is watched by police officers. Koichi Nakano, a professor at Sophia University, said: 'This gives the impression that they haven't learned anything.' It echoes a scandal just one year. ago, when Kyushu Electric Power sought to sway public opinion at a. hearing on restarting reactors in southern Japan. In a sign of the growing discontent,. more than 100,000 anti-nuclear protesters marched in Tokyo on Monday,. adding to pressure on Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda, already struggling. as his Democratic Party unravels over plans to hike the sales tax to. curb public debt. Mr Nakano said: 'The anti-nuclear people are calling for the Democrats to be voted out.' The rally was the biggest since Noda. said last month that Japan needs to restart idled nuclear reactors to. protect jobs and the economy. Damning: The nuclear accident at Fukushima last year was a 'man-made disaster' and not completely because of the tsunami, a report said earlier this month. Reactor meltdown: The damning indictment was delivered by the Japanese parliamentary panel. Disaster: Smoke is pictured ascending from the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant's Unit 3 in Okumamachi in Fukushima Prefecture on March 14 last year. The government is considering three. options for its medium-term energy portfolio - reduce nuclear power's. role to zero as soon as possible, aim at a 15 per cent share by 2030,. and seek a 20 to 25 per cent share by the same date. The new energy mix, to be decided in. August, will replace a scrapped 2010 programme that had sought to raise. nuclear power's share to more than half of electricity needs by 2030. from about 30 per cent before the March 2011 disaster. The Fukushima disaster forced some. 150,000 people to flee their homes, many never to return. Some committed. suicide after seeing their homes and livelihoods destroyed. Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura said the government would be looking at how to improve the hearings. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"In Japan, they opened the first beach for people to swim at since a big problem happened at a nuclear plant last year.

In his theory, James proposed that the perception of what he called an \\"exciting fact\\" directly led to a physiological response, known as \\"emotion.\\" To account for different types of emotional experiences, James proposed that stimuli trigger activity in the autonomic nervous system, which in turn produces an emotional experience in the brain. The Danish psychologist Carl Lange also proposed a similar theory at around the same time, and therefore this theory became known as the James–Lange theory. As James wrote, \\"the perception of bodily changes, as they occur, is the emotion.\\" James further claims that \\"we feel sad because we cry, angry because we strike, afraid because we tremble, and neither we cry, strike, nor tremble because we are sorry, angry, or fearful, as the case may be.\\" Who developed a theory similar to that of James?","output":"Carl Lange developed a theory similar to that of William James."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process:  - A red giant burns mass - This mass creates high core temperatures - The mass decreases - The red giant can no longer fuse the carbon and oxygen in its center - The gravity of the star can no longer hold the outside layers - The layers break away - Only the inner core remains - This inner core is known as a white dwarf.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less leaves fall on the ground happens, how will it affect More mass is burned by the red giant.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis question involves a scenario where fewer leaves fall on the ground, and you would like to know if this has any impact, be it direct or indirect, on the red giant's process of burning mass, eventually leading to the formation of a white dwarf. In order to give a thorough and long response to this question, let's analyze both aspects of the question: the process of a red giant burning mass and transitioning to a white dwarf, and the influence of fewer leaves falling on the ground on this process. First, let's break down the process of a star evolving from a red giant to a white dwarf. 1. A red giant burns mass: Stars like our sun expand into red giants during the latter stages of their lives. This occurs when the hydrogen fuel at the core of the star is depleted, causing the core to contract under the influence of gravity. As the core contracts, the temperature and pressure within it increase, which, in turn, causes the outer layers of the star to expand and heat up. 2. High core temperatures: The increased core temperatures trigger helium fusion, converting helium into carbon and oxygen. This helium fusion process is what primarily fuels the red giant's luminous energy output. 3. Mass decreases: Over time, the mass of the red giant is gradually lost due to the radiation of energy and stellar wind activity. This loss of mass causes a decrease in the gravitational force acting on the outer layers of the star. 4. Carbon and oxygen fusion in the star's center ceases: At a certain point, the core temperature and pressure are no longer sufficient to support the fusion of heavier elements like carbon and oxygen, leading to the end of fusion reactions in the core. 5. Layers break away: With the cessation of fusion reactions, the outer layers of the red giant are no longer held together by the gravitational force of the core. Consequently, these layers drift away to form a planetary nebula, leaving behind the core. 6. Formation of a white dwarf: The exposed core of the star, now devoid of the outer layers, is referred to as a white dwarf. This remnant is supported by electron degeneracy pressure, preventing further contraction under the force of gravity. White dwarfs no longer undergo fusion reactions and gradually cool over time. Now let's examine the second part of the question, which is about the effect of fewer leaves falling on the ground. It is important to note that events occurring on Earth, such as leaves falling, do not affect the processes that take place within a star, including the transition of a red giant into a white dwarf. The process of a red giant burning mass and gradually turning into a white dwarf is determined entirely by factors intrinsic to the star, such as its mass, composition, and the physical processes occurring within its interior. As a consequence, any perturbation associated with fewer leaves falling on the ground would not impact the process described in the given context. In other words, the supposed perturbation has no direct or indirect effects on the process of a star evolving from a red giant to a white dwarf. These two scenarios are independent, with the evolution of a star being dictated by astrophysical factors and the leaf-fall perturbation pertaining to events within our planet's ecosystem."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

The answer to the question: What is the full name of the person who is credited with very few works? is inside the article: The attribution of the panel reflects the progression and trends of 19th and 20th-century scholarship on Early Netherlandish art. It is now thought to have been completed c. 1438–40, but there are still arguments for dates as early as 1424–29. As with the pages ascribed to Hand G in the Turin-Milan Hours manuscript, the panel was attributed to Jan's brother Hubert van Eyck in the 1875 Gemäldegalerie catalogue, and by a 1911 claim by art historian Georges Hulin de Loo. This is no longer considered credible and Hubert, today, is credited with very few works. By 1912 the painting had been definitively attributed to Jan in the museum catalogue.Attempts to date it have undergone similar shifts of opinion. In the 19th century the panel was believed to be an early work by Jan completed as early as c. 1410, although this view changed as scholarship progressed. In the early 20th century, Ludwig von Baldass placed it around 1424–29, then for a long period it was seen as originating from the early 1430s. Erwin Panofsky provided the first detailed treatise on the work and placed it around 1432–34. However, following research from Meyer Schapiro, he revised his opinion to the late 1430s in the 1953 edition of his Early Netherlandish Painting. A 1970s comparative study of van Eyck's 1437 Saint Barbara concluded that Madonna in the Church was completed after c. 1437. In the 1990s, Otto Pächt judged the work as probably a late van Eyck, given the similar treatment of an interior in the 1434 Arnolfini Portrait. In the early 21st century, Jeffrey Chipps Smith and John Oliver Hand placed it between 1426 and 1428, claiming it as perhaps the earliest extant signed work confirmed as by Jan., can you guess it ?

SEOUL — North Korea’s sudden threat to pull out of the upcoming summit with the U.S. raises new doubts of whether a denuclearization deal is possible. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un agreed to meet with U.S President Donald Trump in Singapore on June 12 to work out an agreement to end the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and an end to punishing international sanctions. But on Wednesday North Korea’s Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Kwan released a statement through the state-run KCNA news agency that criticized “unbridled remarks” made specifically by the U.S. president’s National Security Adviser John Bolton demanding that Pyongyang completely decommission its entire nuclear arsenal, along with its ballistic missile program and chemical weapons stockpile, before receiving any compensation or concessions. He expressed “indignation” at the U.S uncompromising position and said North Korea might pull out of the Trump-Kim summit, unless the Trump administration acts with “sincerity” to improve relations through dialogue. “If the United States is trying to drive us into a corner to force our unilateral nuclear abandonment, we will no longer be interested in such dialogue and cannot but reconsider our proceeding to the North Korea-U.S. summit,” the statement said. The vice foreign minister also said it was “absolutely absurd” that Bolton would compare Libya’s experience dismantling its relatively rudimentary nuclear program as a model for dealing with the North’s more advanced and expansive capabilities. He also denounced the Trump administration for “miscalculating the magnanimity” of Kim Jong Un’s decision to suspend further nuclear and missile tests, and his willingness to engage in nuclear talks, as “signs of weakness,” that were the result of what the U.S. administration has dubbed its “maximum pressure” campaign that led international efforts to impose punishing sanctions banning 90% of North Korean trade. The vice minister’s remarks came shortly after the North abruptly canceled... According to the above context, answer the following question. What did the vice minister probably think about the US wanting North Korea to disband the nuclear arsenal? Available options: A). he was not caring either way. B). He probably completely disagreed.

Question: How many casualties were there? Movie title: The Towering Inferno Movie plot: Architect Doug Roberts returns to San Francisco for the dedication of the Glass Tower, which he designed for owner James Duncan. At 138 stories (1,800Â ft/550Â m), it is the world's tallest building. Shortly after his arrival, an electrical short starts an undetected fire on the 81st floor. While Roberts accuses the building's electrical engineer, Roger Simmons of cutting corners, Simmons insists the building is up to standards. During the dedication ceremony, public relations chief Dan Bigelow is ordered to turn on the tower's exterior lights to impress the guests and dignitaries. The lighting overloads the electrical system and Roberts orders it shut off. Smoke is seen on the 81st floor and the San Francisco Fire Department is summoned. Roberts and engineer Will Giddings go to the 81st floor but fail to prevent a security guard opening a door, leading to a fire flash which burns Giddings (and who is later disclosed to have died). Roberts reports the fire to a dismissive Duncan, who refuses to order an evacuation. Ill-equipped firefighters arrive to tackle the blaze, which soon spreads out of control. SFFD Chief Michael O'Halloran forces Duncan to evacuate the guests in the Promenade Room on the 135th floor, directing them to express elevators. A guest, Lisolette Mueller, who is being wooed by con man Harlee Claiborne, rushes to the 87th floor to check on a young family. Simmons admits to Duncan that he cut corners to stay under budget. Duncan, aided by Senator Parker and Mayor Ramsey, directs the elevator evacuation from the Promenade Room until the fire renders the express elevators unsafe. Not heeding Duncan's directions, one last group takes an elevator to the ground, but are killed when it stops on the fire's floor. The fire also traps Bigelow and his secretary/mistress Lorrie in his 65th floor office, killing them. Security Chief Harry Jernigan and Roberts rescue Mueller and the family from 87.

Information:  - The American Civil War was a civil war in the United States fought from 1861 to 1865. The Union faced secessionists in eleven Southern states grouped together as the Confederate States of America. The Union won the war, which remains the bloodiest in U.S. history.  - The German Confederation was an association of 39 German states in Central Europe, created by the Congress of Vienna in 1815 to coordinate the economies of separate German-speaking countries and to replace the former Holy Roman Empire. Most historians have judged the Confederation to have been weak and ineffective, as well as an obstacle to the creation of a German nation-state. It collapsed due to the rivalry between Prussia and Austria, warfare, the 1848 revolution, and the inability of the multiple members to compromise.  - An army (from Latin \\"arma\\" \\"arms, weapons\\" via Old French \\"armée\\", \\"armed\\" (feminine)) or ground force is a fighting force that fights primarily on land. In the broadest sense, it is the land-based military branch, service branch or armed service of a nation or state. It may also include other branches of the military such as the air force via means of aviation corps. Within a national military force, the word army may also mean a field army. They differ from army reserves who are activated only during such times as war or natural disasters.  - A civil war, also known as an intrastate war in polemology, is a war between organized groups within the same state or country, or, less commonly, between two countries created from a formerly united state. The aim of one side may be to take control of the country or a region, to achieve independence for a region or to change government policies. The term is a calque of the Latin \\"bellum civile\\" which was used to refer to the various civil wars of the Roman Republic in the 1st century BC.  - Italian unification, or the Risorgimento (meaning \\"resurgence\\" or \\"revival\\"), was the political and social movement that consolidated different states of the Italian peninsula into the single state of the Kingdom of Italy in the 19th century. The process began in 1815 with the Congress of Vienna and was completed in 1871 when Rome became the capital of the Kingdom of Italy. The memory of the Risorgimento is central to both Italian politics and Italian historiography, for this short period (181560) is one of the most contested and controversial in modern Italian history. Italian nationalism was based among intellectuals and political activists, often operating from exile.  - Dominions were semi-independent polities under the British Crown, constituting the British Empire, beginning with Canadian Confederation in 1867. They included Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Newfoundland, South Africa, and the Irish Free State, and then from the late 1940s also India, Pakistan, and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). The Balfour Declaration of 1926 recognised the Dominions as \\"autonomous Communities within the British Empire\\", and the 1931 Statute of Westminster granted them full legislative independence.  - Cavalry (from French \\"cavalerie\\", cf. \\"cheval\\" 'horse') or horsemen were soldiers or warriors who fought mounted on horseback. Cavalry were historically the most mobile of the combat arms. An individual soldier in the cavalry is known by a number of designations such as cavalryman, horseman, dragoon or trooper. The designation of cavalry was not usually given to any military forces that used other animals, such as camels, mules or elephants. Infantry who moved on horseback, but dismounted to fight on foot, were known in the 17th and early 18th centuries as dragoons, a class of mounted infantry which later evolved into cavalry proper while retaining their historic title.  - The Austro-Prussian War or Seven Weeks' War (also known as the Unification War, PrussianGerman War, German Civil War, War of 1866, Brothers War, or Fraternal War, and in Germany as the German War) was a war fought in 1866 between the German Confederation under the leadership of the Austrian Empire and its German allies on one side and the Kingdom of Prussia with its German allies on the other, that resulted in Prussian dominance over the German states. This conflict also paralleled the Third Independence War of Italian unification.  - The Royal Prussian Army served as the army of the Kingdom of Prussia. It became vital to the development of Brandenburg-Prussia as a European power.  - The Kingdom of Prussia was a German kingdom that constituted the state of Prussia between 1701 and 1918 and included parts of present-day Germany, Poland, Russia, Lithuania, Denmark, Belgium and the Czech Republic. It was the driving force behind the unification of Germany in 1871 and was the leading state of the German Empire until its dissolution in 1918. Although it took its name from the region called Prussia, it was based in the Margraviate of Brandenburg, where its capital was Berlin.  - English America, and later British America, were the English, and later British, territories in North America (including Bermuda), Central America, the Caribbean, and Guyana from 1607 to 1783. Formally, the British colonies in North America were known as \\"British America and the British West Indies\\" until 1776, when the Thirteen British Colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard declared their independence and formed the United States of America. After that, British North America (or, simply but not inclusively, Canada) was used to describe the remainder of Britain's continental North American possessions. The term \\"British North America\\" was first used informally in 1783, but it was uncommon before the Report on the Affairs of British North America (1839), called the Durham Report.  - A nation (from Latin: \\"natio\\", \\"people, tribe, kin, genus, class, flock\\") is a large group or collective of people with common characteristics attributed to them  including language, traditions, \\"mores\\" (customs), \\"habitus\\" (habits), and ethnicity. By comparison, a nation is more impersonal, abstract, and overtly political than an ethnic group. It is a cultural-political community that has become conscious of its autonomy, unity, and particular interests.  - The Austrian Empire (modern spelling \\"\\") was an empire in Central Europe created out of the realms of the Habsburgs by proclamation in 1804. It was a multinational empire and one of Europe's great powers. Geographically it was the second largest country in Europe after the Russian Empire (621,538 square kilometres [239,977 sq mi]). It was also the third most populous after Russia and France, as well as the largest and strongest country in the German Confederation. Proclaimed in response to the First French Empire, it overlapped with the Holy Roman Empire until the latter's dissolution in 1806. The \\"Ausgleich\\" of 1867 elevated Hungary's status. It became a separate entity from the Empire entirely, joining with it in the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary.  - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state.

For centuries, the House of ruled Prussia, successfully expanding its size by way of an unusually well-organised and effective army. Prussia, with its capital in and from 1701 in Berlin, shaped the history of Germany. In 1871, German states united to create the German Empire under Prussian leadership. In November 1918, the monarchies were abolished and the nobility lost its political power during the German Revolution of 191819. The Kingdom of Prussia was thus abolished in favour of a republicthe Free State of Prussia, a state of Germany from 1918 until 1933. From 1933, Prussia lost its independence as a result of the Prussian coup, when the Nazi regime was successfully establishing its ' laws in pursuit of a unitary state. With the end of the Nazi regime, the division of Germany into allied-occupation zones and the separation of its territories east of the line, which were incorporated into Poland and the Soviet Union, the State of Prussia ceased to exist de facto in 1945. Prussia existed \\"\\" until its formal liquidation by the Allied Control Council Enactment No. 46 of 25 February 1947.  - Secession (derived from the Latin term \\"secessio\\") is the withdrawal of a group from a larger entity, especially a political entity (a country), but also any organization, union or military alliance.

We were having an especially rough morning and broke out into an argument. I can't even remember what we were arguing about because it wasn't over a real issue. Before we were able to resolve the argument, we had to go to work. We work for the same company but usually never see each other because we are in different departments. However, there was a required meeting everyone was required to be in that day.  I could feel and see her giving me dagger eyes from across the room so I made a little heart with my hands to alleviate some of the tension. My fiancé made another heart but broke it in half which I thought was hilarious. In response, I texted her (yes during the meeting) \\"Thank you for splitting your heart and giving me half of it. I love you\\".  She responded back with \\"you're an ass for not taking me seriously\\" but I assumed that she was responding to my joke when she did this?

Process:  - The flu virus has receptors, which are like viral Velcro, on the surface of the virus particle - The receptors will lock onto a target cell using these chemical receptors on the surface, which docks onto the cell surface - The receptors  then go into the cell - The receptors use it like a factory - The receptors take it over and make it produce thousands or in some cases millions of copies of new viruses - The copies come streaming out of the cell - The copies infect other cells to make more viruses, or they escape from the body and infect a new victim -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less contact with virus happens, how will it affect MORE cells being damaged.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"If there is less contact with the virus, fewer cells will be initially infected. This could result in a slower spread of the virus within the body, potentially giving the immune system more time to mount a response. The perturbation of reduced viral contact could directly affect the initial stage of the infection process, where the virus binds to target cells and enters them. Indirectly, this perturbation may also impact the overall efficiency of the viral replication process and the ability of the virus to spread within the host. The reduced initial contact could ultimately affect the overall damage to cells, as fewer cells would be infected or produce viral copies. Additionally, the immune system might be more effective in recognizing and neutralizing the virus before it can infect large numbers of cells. In summary, the perturbation of less contact with the virus would potentially have both direct and indirect effects on the process of virus infection and replication. It could lead to fewer cells being infected and damaged, as well as an improved immune response due to a slower rate of viral spread."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Had this kind of data mining been in place 13 years ago, the 9/11 attacks might never have happened, he said. Highlights of his argument, picked up by Mediaite: “Before 9/11, there was an individual by the name of Khalid al-Mihdhar who came to be one of the principle hijackers.

Watching the post parade at this weekend's Kentucky Derby will surely fill some of our heads with dreams of horse ownership. How did the julep-sipping folks acquire their prized horses? How much is buying a racehorse going to set you back? Are they sound investments? These are all tricky questions, but let's take a look at a few stories of horse sales that turned out to be winning lottery tickets...and a few that were more dud than stud. Mr. Prospector becomes a daddy again and again. In 1971, Mr. Prospector was a yearling that fetched 200,000 at auction. When he took to the track, he was good but not great; he won seven of 14 starts but only brought home 112,170 during his career. Still, in 1980 he sold for 20 million. What happened? It turns out \\"Mr. P.\\" was a stud in every sense of the word. While his racing career might not have been the most distinguished, it's tough to argue with his results as a stud. He sired a winner of each of the Triple Crown races, and his grandchildren and great-grandchildren have been similarly speedy. His sons, grandsons, and great-grandsons have combined to win over 30 Triple Crown races and pull in around 100 million in earnings. Mr. P.'s Derby-winning son Fusaichi Pegasus fetched 60 million in 2000, and 18 years earlier, another son -- Belmont winner Conquistador Cielo -- sold for 36.4 million. Mental Floss: Did famous horses get their names? John Henry drives steel, wins cash. When John Henry, a yearling foaled in 1975, came up for bids at the Keeneland January Mixed Sale, he didn't generate much buzz. He had fairly mundane bloodlines, he wasn't particularly big, and he had a nasty temper -- he got his name from a tendency of smashing steel feed buckets. John Calloway bought the unheralded gelding for a modest 1,100 investment and hoped he could make a little cash back on the horse. How did it work out? By the time John Henry retired from racing, he was the top-earning gelding in history with over 6.5 million in career earnings. He won 25 graded stakes races and was racehorse of the decade for the 1980s. Not a shabby return on a 1,100 investment. The Green Monkey makes a monkey out of bidders. Unless you're a huge fan of the band America, you might not envision shelling out eight figures for a horse with no name. That's exactly what happened in a January 2006 auction at Calder Race Course, though. When the auctioneers brought a colt who was only known as \\"number 153\\" to the auction block, a fierce bidding war broke out. Buyers weren't afraid to open their wallets for a colt that was described as \\"perfect,\\" and when the hammer dropped the horse went for a record 16 million. The winning bidders quickly christened the colt The Green Monkey, and excitement to see how the horse would do in races began to build. After all, the colt had run an eighth of a mile in a blazing 9.8 seconds in pre-auction workouts, so anything was possible once he started racing. The buyers thought they were getting a Triple Crown threat. Instead they got the thoroughbred version of Ryan Leaf. The Green Monkey could never translate his workout speed into actual races, and in his career, he only managed one third-place finish in a measly three starts. In 2008, his owners retired him from racing to stand at stud. If his progeny enjoy the success that eluded the Green Monkey, he might make some of his substantial purchase price back. It will be tough, though; right now he only pulls in 5,000 as a stud fee. Mental Floss: 7 things to know about the Kentucky Derby. ...But he's in good company. The Green Monkey shouldn't feel too bad. The horses he took the \\"most expensive colt\\" record from didn't fare much better. Seattle Dancer set the yearling price record in 1985 when he went for a cool 13.1 million before going on to win 150,000 in his five career starts. Snaafi Dancer's sale in 1983 was the worst investment this side of Pets.com stock; the first yearling to break the 10 million price mark never raced -- and was infertile. Cigar comes up empty. Even casual sports fans may remember Cigar, the bay stallion who racked up an incredible 16 straight wins from 1994 to 1996. If Cigar had picked up just 187 more during his career, he would have become the first horse ever to break 10 million in race earnings. When the former Breeders' Cup Classic Champ came up for sale in 1998, there were more than a few breeders who wanted to get their hands on him. Cigar sold for 25 million and promptly went out to stud to recoup some of that cash. That's when breeders discovered a problem: the horse that some analysts called \\"the second-best racehorse ever\\" was infertile. Cigar's new owners got a record 25 million payout on an insurance policy that covered infertility, and the champion stallion is spending the autumn of his years at the Kentucky Horse Park's Hall of Champions. Mental Floss: 7 strange stories of lost cell phones. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"The Kentucky Derby has many people dreaming about owning their own racehorses. The cost of buying a racehorse can vary, with some examples from history including Mr. Prospector, who was bought for 200,000 and eventually sold for 20 million after a successful racing and breeding career. Another example is John Henry, who was bought for only 1,100 and went on to earn over 6.5 million in racing. However, sometimes the investment doesn't pay off, like in the case of The Green Monkey, who was bought for a record 16 million but was unsuccessful in racing. There are no guarantees in investments, and racehorses are no exception. Some people may find great success with their racehorses, while others may not have the same luck. It's important to remember that buying a racehorse is a risky investment and it's not always a guarantee that the horse will pay off in the long run."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the present day, Pym's estranged daughter, Hope van Dyne, and former protégé, Darren Cross, have forced him out of his company, Pym Technologies. Cross is close to perfecting a shrinking suit of his own, the Yellowjacket, which horrifies Pym. Upon his release from prison, well-meaning thief Scott Lang moves in with his old cellmate, Luis. Lang visits his daughter Cassie unannounced and is chastised by his former wife Maggie and her police-detective fiancé, Paxton, for not providing child support. Unable to hold down a job because of his criminal record, Lang agrees to join Luis' crew and commit a burglary. Lang breaks into a house and cracks its safe, but only finds what he believes to be an old motorcycle suit, which he takes home. After trying the suit on, Lang accidentally shrinks himself to the size of an insect. Terrified by the experience, he returns the suit to the house, but is arrested on the way out. Pym, the homeowner, visits Lang in jail and smuggles the suit into his cell to help him break out. Pym, who manipulated Lang through an unknowing Luis into stealing the suit as a test, wants Lang to become the new Ant-Man to steal the Yellowjacket from Cross. Having been spying on Cross after discovering his intentions, Van Dyne and Pym train Lang to fight and to control ants. While Van Dyne harbors resentment towards Pym about her mother Janet's death, he reveals that Janet, known as the Wasp, disappeared into a subatomic quantum realm while disabling a Soviet nuclear missile. Pym warns Lang that he could suffer a similar fate if he overrides his suit's regulator. They send him to steal a device that will aid their heist from the Avengers' headquarters, where he briefly fights Sam Wilson.  answer the following question:  Which people send someone to steal a device from the Avenger's headquarters? The answer is:","output":"Hank Pym and Hope van Dyne send Scott Lang to steal a device from the Avengers' headquarters."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

I think we are fine with  their setoff language (part A only) because the NDP always has the option to  permit setoff to other agreements between the parties as to amounts payable  by the Payee to the Payer (where the Payer owes money under the ISDA to the  Payee). So here's my recommendation:  (1)  Call your friend Andre and hear what he has to say. He has some kind of  suggestion about Part (B) and limiting the NDP's payment to the DP to be  based upon satisfaction that \\"nondisputed\\" amounts having been paid by the  DP. Will he also raise the \\"other agreements\\" issue here? Not a clue. (2)   If Cargill leaves part A in tact and we agree to change part B, I'M  FINE. (I'm fine without part B, actually)  (3)  The potential problem is that Cargill and ENA view part A differently,  right off the bat. I think Cargill is wrong because they don't read part A  as applying to \\"other agreements between the parties\\". But Cargill proposed  part A and it DOES apply to \\"other agreememts between the parties.\\" I don't  want to start off on the wrong foot so I'm sure I'll have to discuss this  again with Marty.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What most naturally follows? How to gift a vehicle  Verify ownership.  This sounds obvious, but the first step before you can give away a vehicle is to make sure that you are the legal owner. To do that, you must have the title.","output":"After verifying ownership of the vehicle, there are several steps you should follow to ensure a smooth and legally compliant gifting process. These steps include: 1. Determine if there are any liens on the vehicle: Ensure that there are no outstanding liens or loans against the vehicle. If there are, you must clear them before gifting the car to another person. This information can be found on the title or by contacting any lienholders listed on the document. 2. Obtain necessary forms and paperwork: Depending on the state or country where both the giver and the receiver live, you will need to gather important forms and documents. Some common documents include a bill of sale, title transfer form, a gift affidavit or statement, and any applicable tax forms for reporting the gift. 3. Prepare the bill of sale: Although the vehicle is a gift, it is still essential to draft a bill of sale. This document serves as a legal record of the transaction, specifying the date and parties involved. It also helps establish that the vehicle was, in fact, a gift and not sold for any monetary consideration. 4. Transfer the title: To transfer the title of the vehicle, the giver must complete the appropriate section on the backside of the title, including the vehicle's odometer reading, their signature, and the recipient's information. In some cases, you may need to submit a separate title transfer form along with the signed title to the local Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) or equivalent government agency. 5. Complete the gift statement or affidavit: Depending on your local requirements, you might need to submit a gift statement or affidavit that indicates the vehicle was given as a gift. Such documents usually require the signatures of both the giver and receiver, as well as the vehicle's identifying information (e.g., vehicle identification number or VIN, make, model, etc.). 6. Report the gifted vehicle, if required: In some regions, you must report the gifted vehicle to the local tax authority or other government offices. Consult your area's regulations to determine if you need to do so and comply accordingly. 7. Obtain insurance for the recipient: Before the recipient can legally drive the gifted vehicle, they must acquire sufficient auto insurance coverage. The recipient should notify their insurance company of the new vehicle to ensure they have suitable coverage before operating the car. 8. Register the vehicle: The recipient must register the gifted vehicle at the local DMV or an equivalent government agency. If the giver or recipient live in different states or countries, follow the regulations in both jurisdictions to fulfill any required vehicle inspections or emissions tests. 9. Pay applicable fees or taxes: Depending on local rules, there may be fees or taxes associated with registering a gifted vehicle. The recipient should research these costs and prepare to cover them when registering the car. 10. Deliver the gifted vehicle: Once all paperwork, fees, and registration have been completed, the giver can now hand over the keys and the vehicle gift. The recipient should remember to store and maintain all paperwork related to the gifted vehicle for future reference and in case of any disputes. In conclusion, gifting a vehicle involves preparing and submitting the necessary documents, fees, and taxes associated with transferring the title, registering the car, and obtaining insurance coverage. It is important to consider the local regulations in both the giver's and recipient's jurisdictions to ensure a smooth and legally compliant process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it. Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"A 2006 study found Ashkenazi Jews to be a clear, homogeneous genetic subgroup. Strikingly, regardless of the place of origin, Ashkenazi Jews can be grouped in the same genetic cohort – that is, regardless of whether an Ashkenazi Jew's ancestors came from Poland, Russia, Hungary, Lithuania, or any other place with a historical Jewish population, they belong to the same ethnic group. The research demonstrates the endogamy of the Jewish population in Europe and lends further credence to the idea of Ashkenazi Jews as an ethnic group. Moreover, though intermarriage among Jews of Ashkenazi descent has become increasingly common, many Haredi Jews, particularly members of Hasidic or Hareidi sects, continue to marry exclusively fellow Ashkenazi Jews. This trend keeps Ashkenazi genes prevalent and also helps researchers further study the genes of Ashkenazi Jews with relative ease. It is noteworthy that these Haredi Jews often have extremely large families.\\"?

If I tell you that Animals may compete for territory, water, food, or partners, and ask you the question \\"animals can compete for territory, water, food, or what?\\", is the correct answer \\"environment\\"?","output":"No, the correct answer to the question \\"animals can compete for territory, water, food, or what?\\" would be \\"partners,\\" as mentioned in the given statement. It implies that animals may engage in competition for gaining access to essential resources such as territory, water, and food, as well as finding suitable mating partners. To elaborate further on each of these resources: 1. Territory: Animals often compete for territory to establish dominance, protect their home range, and provide a safe environment for themselves and their offspring. Adequate territory provides them access to essential resources such as food, water, and shelter. Establishing and defending a territory can also help reduce conflict with neighboring individuals or groups of the same species. 2. Water: Water is a vital resource for all living organisms, and animals may compete for access to water sources such as lakes, rivers, and watering holes. In habitats where water is scarce or seasonal, competition for water can be particularly intense. Water not only quenches an animal's thirst but also plays a critical role in various physiological processes like temperature regulation, digestion, and nutrient absorption. 3. Food: Access to food is essential for an animal's survival and reproduction. Food resources could include plant material, prey species, or decomposing organic matter. By competing for food, animals can secure the necessary energy and nutrients to maintain their health, grow, and reproduce. In many cases, individuals or groups with better access to food have a higher chance of successfully raising offspring and passing on their genes to future generations. 4. Partners: Reproduction is a fundamental aspect of an animal's life, and finding suitable mating partners is crucial for the long-term survival of a species. Animals may compete for mates to ensure their genes are passed on to the next generation. This competition can manifest in various ways, such as displays of physical prowess, demonstrations of resource accumulation, or courtship rituals. Mating success often depends on an individual's ability to outcompete rivals and attract the attention of potential partners. To sum up, the correct answer to the question \\"animals can compete for territory, water, food, or what?\\" is \\"partners.\\" The term \\"environment\\" doesn't accurately capture the specific elements highlighted in the statement, which are territory, water, food, and partners. The environment, in broader terms, encompasses all these aspects and more, but it is not the direct answer to the question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

And not just that, but having reduced the schlepping I do, I've been able to hire more amazing people to lead on our work, and celebrate one of NoTosh's best years ever in terms of the quality, quantity and breadth of work we're doing. Key to traveling less has been a marked increase in the number of folk who see and are now reaping the value of working with us online. I've avoided as many as 20,000 miles of travel thanks to greener clients, who are also many dollars better off having not paid for the airmiles that are wrapped up in our regular fee structure. The quality of our work is better, too, thanks to this. We are doing fewer of those day-long workshops with teachers or leaders, when an hour or even thirty minutes before the day gets started is more worthwhile. We're seeing more school leaders take this up, although it's harder to get teachers into the habit of taking 30 minutes 'me time' to jump into a coaching session on the day or week ahead. But it's starting, and the value to us all is huge. Coaching is very different to 'consulting a Personal Learning Network' on Twitter. It's intense, targeted, focussed and involves a one-on-one discussion that arrives quickly at resolutions to current day challenges that will have a long-term impact. And we come back to measure whether that impact actually happened. I don't think it's a way of working that many are used to in Education, although many corporate clients have had some rare experience with it. Encouraging both groups to take more regular time out for coaching, little and often, is a real challenge, but we're beginning to see some huge impact from relatively little input (and relatively few dollars!).

Summarize this article: \\"Bradford are a shining light to all lower division teams,\\" Perryman, a two-time FA Cup winner during a 17-year Tottenham career, told BBC Sport. \\"To beat three Premier League sides, whatever teams they picked, gives everyone hope.\\" Exeter's director of football was in charge of the Bees when they faced the might of Liverpool the last time they reached the FA Cup quarter-finals in 1989. Brentford have reached the FA Cup quarter-finals four times, the last occasion being in the 1988-89 season when they were beaten 4-0 by reigning Division One champions Liverpool at Anfield. Martin Allen guided the Bees to FA Cup fifth-round appearances in 2005 and 2006 where they lost to Premier League sides Southampton, after a replay, and Charlton Athletic. This is the first season in six since that Brentford have got beyond the third round - and in all but one of the other seasons, they have not even got that far. Chelsea and Brentford have only met once before in the FA Cup, with the Blues winning the tie in 1950 by a 1-0 scoreline. The Bees beat a Premier League team on their last appearance in the fourth round, overcoming bottom of the table Sunderland 2-1 in 2006. Charlton 3-1 Brentford A Reds side with John Barnes, Peter Beardsley, Steve McMahon, Ronnie Whelan and Ray Houghton at the peak of their powers ultimately cruised to a 4-0 win at Anfield, But Perryman's Bees, then, like now, a side in the third tier of English football, had their opportunities early on and he was proud of the way his team handled themselves and the occasion. \\"I think Richard Cadette had two good chances,\\" said Perryman, who skippered Spurs to their FA Cup wins over Manchester City and QPR in 1981 and 1982. \\"Of course I am a bit biased, and maybe a quarter or a half-chance becomes three quarters of a chance - but we could easily have gone ahead. \\"I always thought the first goal was so vital. Liverpool were a great side but I felt they could be vulnerable early on and could be slow starters. \\"We had the first chance early on but didn't take it, and although we didn't live with them in the end, we didn't go there to defend and gave it a really good go.\\" Giving it a good go is exactly what Perryman feels Uwe Rosler's League One promotion hopefuls need to do against an under-pressure Chelsea side who have struggled for consistency since making a blistering start to the season. And while, like that day at Anfield, the odds are stacked heavily in the top-flight side's favour for the first competitive west London derby between the two sides since 1950, Perryman says any FA Cup underdog must be full of belief. \\"Don't tell me you can't get a slip in the box and a lucky break. It's possible,\\" said the Spurs legend, who also won two Uefa Cups and the League Cup twice during his time at White Hart Lane. \\"The longer the smaller team are level, the better their chance - and it only takes a defensive error or a great delivery from a set-piece. \\"There will be a great atmosphere at Griffin Park and that probably lifts the smaller team more than the big team because Chelsea will be used to it. \\"There are no mugs in the lower divisions now. They are all fit, they will have a spring in their step and they can cause an upset.\\" Perryman was Bees boss for three and-a-half years from 1987, and he believes that cup run - which involved seven games just to reach the quarter-finals - did wonders for their belief. Brentford are not an up-and-under, blowing-the-bugle type team. But actually that will probably suit Chelsea more A squad featuring Andy Sinton, Tony Parks, Neil Smillie, Keith Jones, Gary Blissett and Cadette had to win two replays and beat three higher-division clubs in Manchester City (who won promotion to the old Division One that season), Blackburn Rovers and Walsall to set up their dream tie at Anfield. It did come at a cost though. \\"Unfortunately, playing all those games hampered our league progress a bit that season,\\" Perryman said. \\"We were in a good position for promotion and it didn't quite happen. You get involved in so many games there has to be a focus taken away. \\"But I think it was the prelude to getting promoted under Phil Holder in 1992. That Cup run gave the team such confidence that we could be on the same pitch as the big boys. It was a wonderful experience. \\"Sinton got sold on the back of that game [to QPR]. He was obviously a good player but showed he could handle it with the big boys.\\" Brentford are currently third in League One, where they have only lost four times all season. Their defeat by Tranmere Rovers last Saturday was their first at Griffin Park since August and up front they have Clayton Donaldson, who has scored 19 goals in all competitions so far this term. But Chelsea legend Ron Harris, who played 795 games for the Blues before taking up a player-coach role with Brentford in 1980, cannot see an upset despite being impressed with the Bees when he saw them beat Southend to tee up the Chelsea tie. Chelsea were beaten 4-0 by Barnsley in the FA Cup third round in the 1988-89 season but went on to win the old Division Two title. The Blues reached their first FA Cup final in 24 years in 1994 but were brushed aside 4-0 at Wembley by a Manchester United side who clinched the double with that emphatic victory. Chelsea won the 1997 FA Cup final, their first major trophy in 27 years and their second FA Cup success. Since then they have won the competition five further times, in 2000, 2007, 2009, 2010 and 2012. They have won the FA Cup in four of the last six seasons, and have appeared in six of the 13 finals this century. Chelsea v Manchester United 1994 FA Cup final \\"They looked a half-decent side,\\" Harris told BBC Sport. \\"Rosler has got them playing some decent football. \\"Brentford are not an up-and-under, blowing-the-bugle type team and they played it around pretty well. But actually that will probably suit Chelsea more. \\"It's a fantastic tie for Brentford. You get upsets every year but I just cannot see it in this game. \\"Brentford would have to play out of their skin to beat Chelsea and Chelsea would have to play very poorly.\\" Notts County coach Colin Lee, a former Chelsea and Bees player, has been impressed with League One rivals Brentford this season, but cannot see an upset despite the turmoil at Stamford Bridge and the supporters' anger at Rafael Benitez's appointment as manager. \\"Chelsea will put out a very strong team. Brentford deserve that but I think Chelsea will have too much for them,\\" he said. Lee joined Brentford from the Blues in 1987 and combined playing duties with a first foray into management as a youth team coach. And although he was not involved in the game at Anfield, he was still on the playing staff and fondly recalls his spell with the Bees and the excitement that Cup run created. Ron Harris, Micky Droy, Keith Jones, Tommy Baldwin, Colin Lee, Steve Sidwell, Joe Allon, Graham Wilkins, Peter Borota and Stewart Houston. \\"It's a great club,\\" Lee said. \\"I had a fantastic couple of years there. They were good times and good people and some of those people are still involved. \\"The fans will remember this game for a long time. The Liverpool game created a real buzz and the local element will add that extra buzz this time. \\"It will be fantastic for the whole area.

Question: Information:  - Enrico Fermi (29 September 1901  28 November 1954) was an Italian physicist, who created the world's first nuclear reactor, the Chicago Pile-1. He has been called the \\"architect of the nuclear age\\" and the \\"architect of the atomic bomb\\". He was one of the few physicists to excel both theoretically and experimentally. Fermi held several patents related to the use of nuclear power, and was awarded the 1938 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on induced radioactivity by neutron bombardment and the discovery of transuranic elements. He made significant contributions to the development of quantum theory, nuclear and particle physics, and statistical mechanics.  - Induced radioactivity occurs when a previously stable material has been made radioactive by exposure to specific radiation. Most radioactivity does not induce other material to become radioactive. This Induced radioactivity was discovered by Irène Curie and F. Joliot in 1934 and received the Nobel Prize in 1935 for this discovery. This is also known as man-made radioactivity. The phenomenon by which even light elements are made radioactive by artificial or induced methods is called artificial radioactivity.  - Chicago Pile-1 (CP-1), when it achieved criticality, became the world's first artificial nuclear reactor. Its construction was part of the Manhattan Project, the Allied effort to create atomic bombs during World War II. It was built by the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago, under the west viewing stands of the original Stagg Field. The first human-made self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction was initiated in CP-1 on 2 December 1942, under the supervision of Enrico Fermi, who described the apparatus as \\"a crude pile of black bricks and wooden timbers\\".  - A chemist (from Greek chm (ía) alchemy + -ist; replacing chymist from Medieval Latin alchimista) is a scientist trained in the study of chemistry. Chemists study the composition of matter and its properties. Chemists carefully describe the properties they study in terms of quantities, with detail on the level of molecules and their component atoms. Chemists carefully measure substance proportions, reaction rates, and other chemical properties. The word 'chemist' is also used to address Pharmacists in Commonwealth English.  - Alchemy is a philosophical and protoscientific tradition practiced throughout Europe, Egypt and Asia. It aimed to purify, mature, and perfect certain objects. Common aims were chrysopoeia, the transmutation of \\"base metals\\" (e.g., lead) into \\"noble\\" ones (particularly gold); the creation of an elixir of immortality; the creation of panaceas able to cure any disease; and the development of an alkahest, a universal solvent. The perfection of the human body and soul was thought to permit or result from the alchemical magnum opus and, in the Hellenistic and western tradition, the achievement of gnosis. In Europe, the creation of a philosopher's stone was variously connected with all of these projects.  - Oscar D'Agostino ( 29 August 1901 -- 16 March 1975 ) was an Italian chemist and one of the so - called Via Panisperna boys , the group of young scientists led by Enrico Fermi : all of them were physicists , except for D'Agostino , who was a chemist . In 1934 he contributed to Fermi 's experiment ( that gave Fermi the possibility to win the Nobel Prize in 1938 ) to showing the properties of slow neutrons . That led the way to the discovery of nuclear fission , and later on to the construction of the first atomic bomb .  - The Nobel Prize in Physics is a yearly award given by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for those who conferred the most outstanding contributions for mankind in the field of physics. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895 and awarded since 1901; the others being the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Nobel Prize in Literature, Nobel Peace Prize, and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.  - The Via Panisperna boys (Italian: \\"I ragazzi di Via Panisperna\\") were a group of young scientists led by Enrico Fermi. In Rome in 1934, they made the famous discovery of slow neutrons which later made possible the nuclear reactor, and then the construction of the first atomic bomb.  - Pharmacists, also known as chemists (Commonwealth English) or druggists (North American and, archaically, Commonwealth English), are healthcare professionals who practice in pharmacy, the field of health sciences focusing on safe and effective medication use. A pharmacist is a member of the health care team directly involved with patient care. Pharmacists undergo university-level education to understand the biochemical mechanisms and actions of drugs, drug uses, therapeutic roles, side effects, potential drug interactions, and monitoring parameters. This is mated to anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology. Pharmacists interpret and communicate this specialized knowledge to patients, physicians, and other health care providers.

Sepsis management was one of several concerns raised by health inspectors. Doctor Hadiza Bawa-Garba and nurse Isabel Amaro were convicted of manslaughter by gross negligence last year at Nottingham Crown Court. Jack, who had Down's syndrome and a heart condition, was admitted to the hospital with vomiting and diarrhoea. He died 11 hours later from a cardiac arrest caused by sepsis triggered by pneumonia. A trial heard the boy's death was caused by \\"serious neglect\\" by staff who failed to recognise his body was \\"shutting down\\" and close to death. Now a Care Quality Commission (CQC) report into the hospital's emergency department, published on 7 April, has found sepsis clinical pathways were in place, but were not always completed for patients despite evidence of escalating \\"early warning scores\\". Inspectors reported two incidents of staff failing to recognise sepsis or the severity of the condition. In one instance, there was a misdiagnosis of sepsis by a junior doctor of a patient who had a blood clot in a leg which had travelled to a lung. The report also found patients arriving on ambulances were not handed over in a \\"timely manner\\", and the \\"skill mix\\" of nursing staff was not always appropriate to meet patient needs. Jack's mother, Nicola Adcock, from Glen Parva, Leicestershire, said she was previously given assurances procedures were being put in place to tackle problems with sepsis care at the hospital. \\"It's disgusting, it's shocking, it should never happen,\\" she said. \\"I've heard so many stories since Jack, so are they putting things in? Why are they not being adhered to? \\"Nobody will ever understand what we've gone through.\\" Speaking on behalf of Leicester Royal Infirmary, chief nurse Julie Smith said on Friday that it was \\"completely accepted\\" at the time of the inspection that the hospital must do better. She said the hospital now reports back to the CQC every week over sepsis care. The CQC said it served a notice imposing conditions on the registration of the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust - which runs the hospital - after the inspection.

The government takes a certain percentage of the toys made by the toy makers and distributes them to the kids who need them through various programs. Question 2: The procurement of rice under the levy system is how the government gets rice from farmers, just like the toys example. Imagine that instead of toys, the farmers are growing rice plants. The government tells the farmers that they have to give a certain amount of rice from their harvest to the government.

Start with the given equation: -3109*n - 395722 = -153220 2. Your goal is to isolate 'n'. So, the first move is to get rid of the 395722 on the left side of the equation. To do this, add 395722 to both sides of the equation: -3109*n - 395722 + 395722 = -153220 + 395722 This simplifies to: -3109*n = 242502 3. Now, you will need to get rid of the coefficient (-3109) in front of the 'n' to isolate 'n'. To do this, divide both sides of the equation by -3109: (-3109*n) / -3109 = 242502 / -3109 4. Performing the division on both sides will give you the value of 'n': n = -78 So, the solution to the equation -3109*n - 395722 = -153220 is n = -78."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Should I validate this answer? Answer:","output":"No, the suggested answer does not directly address the question of which came first: the army or the air force. Instead, it discusses the functions and responsibilities of Headquarters AAF during early air force operations. A more appropriate response to the question would involve a brief historical overview of the development of both forces. To answer the question, we can look back on the history of military organization and modern armed forces. The concept of an organized and trained army dates back thousands of years, with early examples including the Egyptian, Hittite, and Assyrian armies that existed during the ancient period. These ground troops were the foundation of military defense and offense for much of human history. The development of the air force, on the other hand, is a more recent occurrence in history. The use of air power for military purposes only became possible with the invention of machines capable of sustained and controlled flight, such as airplanes and airships. The first air forces began to appear at the onset of the 20th century, with the Italian and French air forces being the pioneers of aerial combat during World War I. In the United States, the United States Army Air Service (USAAS) was established during World War I, but it functioned as a part of the army. It later became the United States Army Air Corps and then the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). It wasn't until 1947 that the United States Air Force (USAF) was officially formed as a separate branch of the military, independent from the army. In conclusion, the army was established long before the air force, as the development of organized, trained ground troops predate the invention and adaptation of air power for military purposes. You should reject the suggested answer because it does not address the question about which came first and instead focuses on a specific aspect of early air force operations. A better answer would be: \\"The army came first historically, with the concept of organized ground troops dating back thousands of years to ancient civilizations. The air force is a more recent development, appearing at the onset of the 20th century with the invention of machines capable of sustained, controlled flight and their subsequent adaptation for military purposes.\\""},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A wander through the market like any other becomes, in spring time, a new experience. I feel like a fresh arrival, like it’s my first time walking through my local market. There are long, twisty fava bean pods, waiting to be podded and munched on with bitey pecorino cheese to tame the bitterness of the raw beans. Thin, long-stemmed asparagus. A lovely array of greens, including radishes with leaves so happy that they become the main ingredient, fluffy-fronded fresh herbs and fresh garlic. Artichokes of many different kinds, but especially the pointed purple ones that are either local, from Tuscany’s Maremma, or sometimes from Puglia or Sicily. Rarely the rounded globe artichokes you find spilling out of crates in Rome, or the tiny, delicate Venetian ones, the so-called castraure (though they often aren’t the real deal, how you can tell is by the price) that you can find in the shadow of the Rialto.

Emily is the smoker. Based on the information provided in the sentence, we can deduce that Emily currently has a bad cough, whereas Victoria does not. One possible reason that Emily may have a bad cough is due to smoking. Smoking is known to cause respiratory issues and can lead to various health problems, including persistent coughing. It is not uncommon for smokers to have a bad cough as a result of their habit. In this context, the fact that Victoria doesn't have a bad cough can be interpreted as an indication that she is less likely to be a smoker than Emily, as she is not displaying this specific symptom usually associated with smoking. It is important to note, however, that there may be other factors contributing to Emily's cough, and it is not definitive evidence that she is a smoker. It is also possible that Victoria is a smoker but does not currently have a cough. To further support the idea that Emily is the smoker, we can look at other contextual factors. If, for example, Emily has mentioned in the past that she smokes or has been seen smoking, this evidence would strengthen the argument that Emily is the smoker in this scenario. Additionally, any other known health issues or environmental factors that could be causing Emily's cough should be considered, as this may change the likelihood that her cough is due to smoking. In conclusion, the sentence suggests that Emily has a higher likelihood of being the smoker due to her current bad cough, a symptom often associated with smoking, and the fact that Victoria doesn't have a cough lowers the probability of her being a smoker.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Review: 2011 Honda Odyssey Oh Generations X and Y, you think you are so cool with your extreme sports and your vampires. Well, guess what? You’re turning into your parents just like everyone does eventually. After an SUV tax break-driven slump, minivan sales are on the rise again as children of the 1980’s and 1990’s start families of their own and reminisce about the good old days when they made mom drop them off down the block from school so that their friends wouldn’t see them getting out of the Dodge Caravan with the fake wood paneling. Apparently, the functional charms of such vehicles were so strong that they became subliminally ingrained into the minds of these otherwise embarrassed youths like the lyrics of a heavy metal song. It’s a phenomenon that partly explains Honda’s decision to use a riff from the “The Hellion” by Judas Priest in one of its commercials for the 2011 Odyssey. “Heading Out to the Highway” must’ve already been taken. In any case, somewhere there's a leather-clad fallen angel weeping. This isn’t to say that every 20 to 30-something is flocking to the box. The marketing team at Honda has indentified a demographic that it calls “hesitators” who are attracted to the practicality of a minivan, but can’t stomach the image it bestows upon them. This is why the automaker has worked hard to change that impression. Perhaps too hard. The new Odyssey is longer, lower and wider than the model it replaces, and features a subtle take on the armored-up style recently seen on cars from Honda’s luxury division, Acura. Its most distinctive element is the “lightning bolt” belt line that zigzags under the rearmost side windows, drawing the attention of passers-by while giving third row passengers a better view out of the extended glass. Nearly as prominent are the tracks for the sliding rear doors. They are so wide that if you leave the Odyssey parked outside too long you may find troublemaking teenagers storing their contraband in them. Honda says it hasn’t tried to hide the gap in the bottom of the window frame like other companies do so that it doesn’t impinge on shoulder room, but you know it's really all about the bolt. It’s not just the third row that gets this sort of spatial consideration, however. There is so much width available in the second row that Honda had to figure out what to do with all of it. The answer? Wide Mode, which allows the outboard seats to be slid sideways to make lots of room for three well-fed American types, or a trio of full-size child seats. The center hump even shuffles forward half a foot to make it easier for the front seat passenger turn around and wipe baby’s mouth – assuming that her husband got stuck sitting back there. As you’d expect from the second best-selling minivan nameplate in America (congratulations Chrysler Town and Country), amenities are plentiful across the seven trim levels of the Odyssey that start at 28,580 and run up to 44,030. Sure, having only 15 cup and bottle holders means that one of the eight people on board will have to make due with just one Big Gulp, but there’s also a cool box located in the bottom of the dashboard that can fit a six pack. When you’re done with your drinks, a ring pops out from the back of the center console that can be used to hold a small garbage bag for the trash. Above it – in the top-level Touring Elite model, at least – you’ll find an entertainment system mounted to the ceiling that may look strangely familiar. This is because the 16.2-inch Ultrawide monitor is the same as the one in the Toyota Sienna. Honda has packaged it into a unique pod that includes two speakers and a rechargeable remote control. The screen itself can be split to display images from two different sources simultaneously, and the system includes an HDMI input and wireless headphones. Of course the folks in the front seats are left out of the fun and stuck with having to enjoy the spoken-word version of “Despicable Me” because the safety patrol won’t let the 8-inch screen for the navigation system play movies on the move. This is fine for the driver – if not the one riding shotgun - because the Odyssey offers other, more dynamic forms of entertainment. Fox Car Report is on Twitter. Follow us @foxcarreport The six-cylinder engine in the Odyssey gets a modest 4 horsepower bump in output to 248 horsepower, but it is plenty. A five-speed automatic transmission is standard, but Touring models get a six-speed that not only makes better use of the power on hand, but also increases fuel economy from 18 mpg city/27 mpg highway to 19/28. That’s crazy good efficiency for such a large car. In fact, it’s the best of any eight-passenger vehicle currently on sale. The Odyssey achieves it by running the engine on just four our three cylinders when all six aren’t necessary. The system is seamless in its operation, aided by active noise-canceling technology that counteracts any unbalanced sounds coming from under the hood. Noises and warning lights that you may be more interested in are activated by front and rear proximity sensors that keep you from running into things a low speeds and a blind spot information system for when you need to change lanes. Active cruise control is not available, but the rear backup camera has three views – Normal, Wide (what’s up with this wide stuff?) and Top-Down. Unfortunately, its location makes it particularly susceptible to being obscured by mud and snow. Despite being so fully outfitted for suburban family battle, it’s a pleasant surprise to find that Odyssey is actually a good drive, too. The ride is so controlled that you can easily find yourself doing things with it on twisty roads that aren’t typically advisable in such a large, tall vehicle. Nevertheless, a five-star crash test rating – including top marks in for rollovers – means that you are well-protected in the event that you do manage to overstep its limits. At more parental speeds the richly-appointed cabin is almost luxury-sedan quiet and the fully-independent suspension as smooth as the engine. It’s almost enough to make you forget sedans and coupes even exist. Better yet, when the mid-life crisis hits in a couple of years and you buy a convertible to go with your implants – hair or otherwise – you can give the kids the Odyssey to use for High School. Yea, they’ll hate you for it, but it’ll be perfect for carrying around the equipment for their rebellious-youth garage band. If they’re good enough, maybe one day they’ll do the soundtrack for a station wagon commercial. They’re coming back, too, you know. And the cycle of life continues. Power: 248 hp, 250 lb-ft torque Transmission: 5 or 6-speed automatic MPG: 18 city/27 hwy (5-speed), 19 city/28 hwy (6-speed) Summary:","output":"The 2011 Honda Odyssey, featuring its iconic \\"lightning bolt\\" design under the rearmost side windows, continues to captivate Generations X and Y, who are beginning to appreciate the functionality of minivans as they establish families of their own. Honda's innovative design works to change the traditional minivan image often associated with previous generations. The new Odyssey, with a wider, lower, and longer frame than its predecessor, offers increased space and comfort. This is particularly evident in the second row, which features a 'Wide Mode' allowing the seats to slide sideways in order to offer more space. Additional notable features of the 2011 Odyssey include the large tracks for its sliding rear doors, an abundant 15 cup and bottle holders and a cool box conveniently placed at the bottom of the dashboard for storage. It also boasts an entertainment system housed in a unique pod, featuring a 16.2-inch Ultrawide monitor, two speakers, and a rechargeable remote control.  Powered by a six-cylinder engine with an output of 248 horsepower, the Odyssey balances this raw power with fuel efficiency, achieving 18 mpg city/27 mpg highway in its standard model, and 19 mpg city/28 mpg highway with its Touring model. Its efficiency is further bolstered by smart technology that only runs the required number of engine cylinders and uses active noise-cancelling technology to counteract imbalanced sounds. Safety aspects are also well-addressed in the 2011 Odyssey. The vehicle features front and rear proximity sensors and a blind spot information system. A rear backup camera provides three view options, and the car's five-star crash test rating includes top marks for rollovers.  Overall, the 2011 Honda Odyssey provides a good driving experience along with robust features, thoughtful design and a consideration for safety, striking a balance between the dynamism of a sedan and the practicality of a minivan."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The interesting fact about them wast that, while Twin I had a very cold water all year, Twin II lake had very warm waters year round.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which body of water had fewer problems in the vicinity of industrial discharge ?  Hint: The temperature of a body of water directly affects the amount of dissolved oxygen it can hold. Following Henry's law, as water becomes warmer, oxygen becomes less soluble in it. This property leads to daily anoxic cycles on small geographic scales and seasonal cycles of anoxia on the larger scale. Thus, bodies of water are more vulnerable to anoxic conditions during warmest period of the day and during the summer months. This problem can be further exacerbated in the vicinity of industrial discharge where warm water used to cool machinery is less able to hold oxygen than the basin to which it is released. Answer:","output":"Based on the information given and taking into account Henry's Law, the body of water with fewer problems in the vicinity of industrial discharge would be Twin I lake. This is because Twin I lake has very cold water all year round, which means it can hold more dissolved oxygen compared to warmer water, making it less vulnerable to anoxic conditions caused by industrial discharge."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A detailed and long answer for the given question would be: Supporters of Daylight Saving Time (DST) generally believe that people would prefer to have an extra hour of daylight after their usual workday. Extending daylight into the evening is one of the main reasons behind the concept of DST. By moving the clock forward one hour in the spring, as observed in many countries, the amount of evening daylight increases, while the amount of daylight in the morning decreases. The primary argument in favor of DST is based on the premise that people would utilize the additional daylight during leisure activities, which usually happen after working hours. This extended evening daylight can promote healthier lifestyles by encouraging people to engage in outdoor activities such as sports, exercise, and recreation. Extended evening daylight also benefits retail businesses, as it tends to encourage more shopping. The statement you provided addresses the energy consumption aspect of DST. Advocates posit that it can reduce the need for lighting and heating, and thus decrease overall energy consumption. This argument also contributes to the belief that people would prefer having an extra hour of daylight in the evenings, as it may lead to significant cost savings and environmental benefits. However, it should be noted that the actual impact of DST on energy use, as well as the preferences of individuals in relation to daylight hours, is subjective and varies based on factors such as location, climate, and individual habits. As the statement suggests, the effect of DST on overall energy consumption is heavily disputed, with some research indicating minimal or no significant savings in energy usage, and in some cases, even an increase in energy consumption. In summary, while the statement you provided does not directly address the question, it is important to understand that those who favor DST generally believe that people would prefer having an extra hour of daylight after their usual workday. The underlying rationale is that this extra daylight would promote healthier and more active lifestyles, benefit businesses, and potentially reduce energy consumption. However, it is essential to consider that the actual effect on energy use and personal preferences varies and remains a topic of debate."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this article and answer this question The Bears began their 2008 season by recording an upset victory over the Indianapolis Colts at the newly opened Lucas Oil Stadium. The team won the Super Bowl XLI rematch, by a score of 29-13. The Bears offensive attack featured the debut of rookie running back Matt Fort&#233;, becoming the first Bears rookie running back to start a game since Walter Payton in 1975, coincidentally against the Baltimore Colts (Anthony Thomas also started as a running back for the Bears in 2001). Forte carried the ball 23 times for 123 yards, including a 50-yard touchdown run. The Colts and Bears exchanged field goals, and then Joseph Addai was dropped for a safety.  A Robbie Gould 25-yard field goal on the following drive ended the 1st half. Peyton Manning helped the Colts narrow their deficit by throwing a six-yard touchdown pass to Reggie Wayne. Later in the 3rd quarter, Bears cornerback Charles Tillman forced a fumble, which Lance Briggs picked up and returned for a 21-yard touchdown. The Bears defense was able to contain the Colts the rest of the way, including a key fourth down and one yard stop near midfield early in the fourth quarter. The Bears essentially sealed their victory with 8:56 left on a one-yard touchdown run by fullback Jason McKie. After the game, Al Michaels and John Madden awarded Forte with the Sunday Night Football's \\"Horse Trailer Player of the Game\\" award. Adewale Ogunleye received the NFC Defensive Player of the Week award for recording a safety, three tackles-for-loss, and making a key fourth down stop during the game.

Is the Court Being Thoughtful or Partisan? Richard A. Epstein, N.Y.U. School of Law Shifting responsibility to the states would help protect individual liberty, sorely needed in a health care system suffocating under national regimentation. Elizabeth Wydra, Constitutional Accountability Center Two conservative court of appeals judges provided compelling, conservative arguments for the mandate’s constitutionality. Should the court uphold this onerous statute, Congress will ever after be allowed to dictate private activities of citizens — well beyond the enumerated powers in the Constitution. Kermit Roosevelt III, author, \\"The Myth of Judicial Activism\\" It's a straightforward case, but by spending extra time on it the justices may placate the losing side. James F. Blumstein, Vanderbilt Law School The law would be a bait and switch, changing the rules, and adding to states' burdens after they agreed to Medicaid's conditions. Ilya Somin, George Mason University School of Law If Congress can regulate the failure to purchase insurance, there would be no limits to its power. What was this article about?","output":"This article features a collection of opinions from various law experts and authors concerning the role of the court in evaluating the constitutionality of a healthcare mandate, specifically, whether the court's approach is thoughtful or partisan. They discuss the implications of the court's decision on individual liberty, national regulation, and the balance of power between the federal government and the states. Richard A. Epstein argues that shifting healthcare responsibility to states would protect individual liberty amidst national regimentation. In contrast, Elizabeth Wydra highlights the conservative arguments for the mandate's constitutionality. A fear expressed by some, including an anonymous contributor, is that if the court upholds this statute, Congress's power over citizens' private activities would expand, going beyond the enumerated powers in the Constitution. Kermit Roosevelt III believes that the case is straightforward but suggests that the justices may be extending the discussion to placate the losing side. James F. Blumstein argues that the law is a bait-and-switch tactic, burdening states with additional responsibilities. Lastly, Ilya Somin asserts that allowing Congress to regulate the failure to purchase insurance would result in an unlimited expansion of its power.

Republican Cory Gardner has opened up a four-point lead in a Colorado Senate race that's key in determining whether Democrats can hold onto their majority, a new CNN/ORC poll shows. Gardner held a 50 percent to 46 percent edge on first-term Democratic Sen. Mark Udall in the survey of 665 likely voters, conducted Oct. 9-13. The poll's margin of error is plus or minus 4 percentage points. Republicans have targeted Udall and several other Democratic incumbents in their effort to win at least six seats this fall -- enough to gain a Senate majority for President Barack Obama's final two years in office.

While your given statement provides a partially accurate description of some of the events that occurred in northern Burma, it doesn't specifically mention the time when the Chinese invaded the region. The Burma Campaign was a series of battles fought in the British colony of Burma, between the Allied forces (primarily British, Indian, Chinese, and American) and the Japanese Empire. The campaign took place from December 1941 to August 1945. The invasion of northern Burma by the Chinese forces happened in several stages: 1. First Stage (1942): Following the Japanese invasion of Burma in December 1941, the Chinese Expeditionary Force entered the northern part of the country in early 1942 to support the retreating British and Indian forces. Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek sent the Fifth Army and Sixth Army, both of which were deployed successfully to slow down the rapid Japanese advance into the country. However, this initial attempt was hard-going for the Chinese, and they couldn't turn back the Japanese forces until they met with strong reinforcements. 2. Second Stage (1943-1944): The Chinese forces launched several counteroffensives into northern Burma in 1943. These were aided by US General Joseph Stilwell's force (also known as \\"X Force\\") and the British Chindits, which were long range penetration groups operating behind the Japanese lines. However, these efforts were not enough to reclaim the lost territories and expel the Japanese from the region. 3. Third Stage (1944-1945): The major Chinese invasion of northern Burma occurred in late 1944 and early 1945 through a series of operations collectively known as Operation Grubworm. This was conducted in conjunction with the US-led Northern Combat Area Command (NCAC) and other Allied forces, which included British, Indian, and African troops. The joint alliance focused on opening the Ledo-Burma Road to create a supply route between Burma and China. The operations to capture and control northern Burma by the Chinese and Allied forces were ultimately successful, pushing the Japanese forces out and opening the route by February 1945. In conclusion, the Chinese invasion of northern Burma took place during various stages between 1942 and 1945, with the main invasion occurring in late 1944 and early 1945. The given statement contains information related to the events that took place in northern Burma during the campaign but doesn't accurately specify the time of the Chinese invasion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Michael is planning on playing a prank on his older brother. He is going to take a bungee cord and stretch it and then release it so that it hits his older brother as he is sleeping.  He is deciding whether to stretch the cord only partially or completely before releasing it.  Will the bungee cord resist further stretching more when it's stretched partially or completely?  Hint: Something that is elastic can return to its original shape after being stretched or compressed. This property is called elasticity . As you stretch or compress an elastic material like a bungee cord, it resists the change in shape. It exerts a counter force in the opposite direction. This force is called elastic force . The farther the material is stretched or compressed, the greater the elastic force becomes. As soon as the stretching or compressing force is released, elastic force causes the material to spring back to its original shape. You can watch a demonstration of elastic force at this URL: The answer to this question is:","output":"When a bungee cord is stretched, it exhibits an elastic force that opposes the stretching. The greater the stretch, the greater the elastic force becomes. Elastic materials, such as a bungee cord, are able to return to their original shape after being stretched or compressed due to their property of elasticity. Step 1: Compare the elastic force when the bungee cord is stretched partially and when it is stretched completely. - When the bungee cord is stretched partially, the elastic force opposing the stretching will be less compared to when it is stretched completely. - When the bungee cord is stretched completely, the elastic force opposing the stretching will be greater compared to when it is stretched partially. Step 2: Determine which scenario of stretching the bungee cord results in greater resistance. - Based on the comparison in Step 1, the bungee cord will resist further stretching more when it is stretched completely than when it is stretched partially due to the greater elastic force. The answer to this question is: The bungee cord will resist further stretching more when it's stretched completely as opposed to when it's stretched partially, because the elastic force becomes greater as the material is stretched further."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The three Kansas militiamen planned to blow up an apartment complex housing Somali refugees during the 2016 presidential election, unleashing what one of them called \\"Crusades 2.0.\\" But their plan was foiled after their arrest just weeks before the election, highlighting the changing enemy list of a movement founded on the back of anti-government activism a generation ago. And with the election of a president whose policies many militia members support, the urge to confront the government appears to have lost some of its urgency. Instead of railing at the government, they have in recent years turned their venom against new-found foes: Muslims, immigrants, the Antifa. \\"Some of the militia groups have been refocusing their attention on secondary enemies for the movement,\\" said Mark Pitcavage, who researches extremism at the Anti-Defamation League civil rights group. Often lumped together with other right-wing groups, the anti-government movement comes in different forms. There are the \\"preppers,\\" so called because they stockpile water, food and other essentials in preparation for civil unrest. There are the \\"survivalists,\\" people who learn skills to “live off the land” in case of a disaster. There are “sovereign citizens” such as the suspect in the recent shooting at a Waffle House in Tennessee who are opposed to paying taxes and believe they should decide which laws to follow. And then there are the militiamen who conduct regular military-style training to resist a government they see as engaged in a global plot to take away their guns and constitutional rights. The modern militia movement dates back to a series of events in the early 1990s, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. Among them: the 1992 election of Democratic President Bill Clinton and an FBI attack the following year on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, an event seen as \\"evidence of an out of control government willing to attack citizens.\\" Under Clinton, the number... how do militia groups feel about Donald Trump?

Movie title: Buried Movie plot: On October 23, 2006, Paul Conroy, an American civilian truck driver working in Iraq, wakes up and finds himself buried alive in a wooden coffin, bound and gagged, with only a Zippo lighter and a BlackBerry phone at hand. Although he initially has no idea how he got there, he starts to piece together what has happened to him. He remembers that his and several other trucks were ambushed by terrorists, who killed his colleagues; he was hit by a rock and passed out. He receives a call from his kidnapper, Jabir, demanding that he pay a ransom of 5 million by 9PM or he will be left in the coffin to die. Conroy calls the State Department, which tells him that due to the government policy of not negotiating with terrorists, it will not pay the ransom but will try to rescue him. They connect him with Dan Brenner, head of the Hostage Working Group, who tells Conroy they are doing their best to find him. His kidnapper calls Conroy and demands he make a ransom video, threatening to execute one of his colleagues who survived the attack. Conroy insists that no one will pay 5 million, so the kidnapper drops the amount to 1 million. Despite his compliance in making a video, the kidnappers execute his colleague and send him the recording of it, which he watches in horror. Shortly afterwards, distant explosions shake the area, damaging his coffin, which begins to slowly fill with sand. Conroy continues sporadic phone calls with Brenner, skeptical of the man's promises of help. To reaffirm his wholehearted intentions, Brenner tells Conroy about a 26-year-old named Mark White who was rescued from a similar situation three weeks previously, telling him that the kid is home with his family and happy. Later on, Conroy receives a phone call from his employers, who inform him that he was fired from his job due to an alleged prohibited relationship with a colleague (the one who was executed), and thus he and his family will not be entitled to any benefits or pension he earned during his time with the company.

(617 + 108 - 1236) * n + 18907 = 0    (-511) * n + 18907 = 0 3. To solve for n, isolate n by moving the constant term to the other side of the equation.    -511 * n = -18907 4. Divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of n (-511) to find the value of n.    n = -18907 / -511 5.

Movie title: Shoot to Kill Movie plot: This article needs an improved plot summary. (May 2015) A man is discovered breaking into his own jewellery shop in the dead of night. Questioned closely, it is discovered that his wife is being held hostage at their home by Steve, a brutal extortionist who demands the diamonds in the shop's safe in exchange for the woman's life. After Steve kills the family maid, FBI agent Warren Stantin (Sidney Poitier) hands over the diamonds, but Steve kills the jeweller's wife anyway, and escapes. Feeling that he has failed, Stantin becomes obsessed with finding Steve, and he chases Steve into the rugged forests of the state of Washington, where Steve joins up with a group of sportsmen who plan to trek into the wilderness on a fishing trip. Steve's plan is to kill them and force their guide, Sarah (Kirstie Alley), to lead him through the wilderness to the CanadaâUS border. Stantin must team up with Sarah's mountain-man boyfriend Jonathan Knox (Tom Berenger) to pursue Steve. Jonathan does not believe city slicker Stantin can keep up on a tough cross-country hike that includes some rock climbing, and Stantin is determined to prove himself. They pursue Steve and Sarah into the wilderness and eventually to the streets of Vancouver. The movie also featured a chase scene aboard the BC Ferries Queen of Vancouver. After a long chase, Stantin manages to shoot Steve in an underwater struggle. The killer's identity is not revealed until midway through the film. He attempts to evade detection by killing a member of a hiking expedition and taking his place. To keep the audience guessing as to the true identity of the villain, some of the hikers were played by actors known for playing bad guys: notably Clancy Brown (Highlander), Frederick Coffin (Mother's Day), Andrew Robinson (Dirty Harry) and Richard Masur (the vicious drug dealer in Who'll Stop the Rain).

Sutherland once lived in Brooklyn but has since moved back to Seattle, where he and Knox attended middle school. Here, Knox is pictured with Sutherland in New York during a visit in July      Sealed with a kiss: Sutherland (again seen here with Knox during her visit to New York as they locked lips at Coney Island) and Knox reported were engaged last week      Childhood friend: Sutherland reportedly wrote to Knox as she sat in an Italian prison following her 2009 conviction. The pair have known each other since middle school      She was set to graduate from the University of Washington this past June with a degree in creative writing.      She's now working at a Seattle bookstore and as a writer for the West Seattle Herald.      Meanwhile, her case is headed back into the Italian courts once again following an initial conviction, an overturning of that conviction followed by her reconviction along with Sollecito.      It seems unlikely Knox, who now lives in the U.S, will ever be returned to jail for the crime as she has repeatedly refused to return to Italy. If she is convicted again, Italy is likely to request to extradite her but her longstanding battle to prove her innocence has made her a cause célèbre in the U.S who may ignore political pressure to send her back.      Sollecito and Knox were first found guilty of murder in November 2009.      The previous man: Knox was last known before Sutherland to be dating classical guitarist James Terrano, who she reportedly lived with in Seattle, Washington      The killers' convictions were later quashed after experts said forensic evidence had been contaminated and they were released. Prosecutors then appealed that finding and the case was re-tried in March 2013.      In January last year a court upheld the original verdict, but the pair remained at large as under Italy's legal system, any verdict reached after a second appeal but be ratified by the highest court.      Since the last verdict, Sollecito, 30, has stayed in Italy. He was ordered to remain there after being found near the Italian border with Slovenia and Austria hours after being found guilty for the second time. He has since completed a degree in information technology.      Back then: Knox was accused along with her then boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito (both at left) of brutally murdering Knox's roommate in Perugia, Italy Meredith Kercher, 21 (right) in 2007      Kercher, 21, was found dead on the floor of her bedroom. Some of her belongings were missing and Knox reported an apparent burglary to police.      Detectives concluded the supposed break-in looked staged and Knox became the prime suspect.      She then implicated Patrick Lumumba, a bar owner she worked for. The duo were arrested along with Sollecito. Mr Lumumba was later released when evidence pointed to Rudy Guede's involvement.      Guede was then accused of committing the murder along with Sollecito and Knox. In October 2008 he was found guilty of sexually assaulting and murdering Kercher.      Home for good: While it's highly unlikely that Knox would be extradited no matter what happens in court in March, her ex Raffaele Sollecito must face the music in his home country ||||| Originally published February 11, 2015 at 3:45 PM | Page modified February 11, 2015 at 5:25 PM      Amanda Knox got engaged last week.      For an ordinary 27-year-old Seattleite, a wedding would be a pivot to a new life. The future Mr. Knox is Colin Sutherland, also 27, a musician who recently moved to Seattle from New York. They’ve known each other since middle school. Best of luck, and happy Valentine’s Day.      But Knox’s life is extraordinary, for all the wrong reasons. Married or not, Knox’s future is frozen at Nov. 2, 2007, the day her roommate, Meredith Kercher, was found brutally slain just at the start of Knox’s junior year abroad in Italy.      Since then, Knox’s case has pinballed through the Italian judicial system in ways that baffles many Americans. In quick summary: Knox returned home to West Seattle in 2011 after her murder conviction was reversed on appeal. That decision was appealed by prosecutors, and she and her ex-boyfriend were re-convicted in 2014.      The case takes another turn March 25 this year, when Italy’s Court of Cassation, its highest court, hears yet another appeal of an appeal, and decides whether Italy may seek to force Knox back for another trial.      Knox has sought to keep a low profile since returning, despite bouts of paparazzi stalking that yielded pictures of her and Sutherland, a lanky rock musician. Her engagement was disclosed by a source close to the family, and Knox confirmed it in an email, but declined to say anything else.      I met Knox for coffee late last year at a West Seattle café, on her condition it would be off-the-record. She’d recently graduated from the University of Washington, finishing the degree interrupted by her four years in prison, and had begun writing for the West Seattle Herald. She works at a bookstore.      As we talked about journalism, she struck me as a normal would-be writer — earnest, well-read, a bit of a goofy sense of humor. When I brought up her pending case, she shut down entirely.      I don’t blame her. The killing of her roommate spawned an industry of websites and message boards. The fine grains of evidence are sifted and re-sifted through nearly every possible lens — American entitlement, Italian buffoonery, female sexual power, male prosecutorial abuse, and so on.      Race plays a role because Knox falsely accused a black Italian man before recanting, a serious mistake she apologized for in her memoir. And then there’s Rudy Guede, who was convicted separately in Kercher’s death. Despite credible evidence pointing to him as the sole culprit, Guede could be released before Knox’s fate is determined.      Friends and sources consistently ask me about Knox, whose case I’ve covered off and on since 2007. To believe she’s innocent, you have to simply be willing to believe that prosecutors get stuck with tunnel vision, and that Italian judges are fallible political animals. It is telling that prosecutors’ sensational theory about Kercher’s death — a sex game gone awry — was abandoned in the latest court ruling, in favor of a more pedestrian case of roommate squabbling.      None of these theories holds up. It is a highly circumstantial case, with DNA evidence so thin that Knox probably wouldn’t have even been charged in the United States. The prosecution’s shifting theories reflect the fact that Knox had no motive. She might be America’s most famous wrongfully convicted person.      The March 25 hearing in Italy could result in her acquittal. Many of Knox’s supporters instead fear she and ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito could be sent back for yet another trial. Knox has said publicly she has no intention of voluntarily returning to Italy. An extradition process would be legally difficult to avoid and painfully expensive for her family, but I suspect members of Washington’s congressional delegation will make it into a political fight.      Until then, if Seattleites see Knox around town, give her a smile and maybe a congratulations on her engagement. (No date has been set, according to my source.)      Her husband-to-be wrote her while she was in prison, and now he has signed up to be stalked by paparazzi, British tabloids and Internet trolls. It must be love.

Input: Review: First love is a desperately difficult subject to pull off convincingly in cinema : the all-encompassing passion involved generally ends up as a pale imitation or, worse, slightly ridiculous.Lifshitz manages to avoid all the pitfalls and delivers a moving, sexy, thoroughly engrossing tale of love, disaster and possible redemption, while tangentially touching on some of the deeper themes in human existence.The core story is of Mathieu, 18, a solitary, introverted boy who meets Cédric, brasher, more outgoing but just as lonely, while on holiday with his family. As the summer warms on, they fall in love and, when the holidays end, decide to live together. A year later, the relationship ends in catastrophe: Cédric cheats on Mathieu who, distraught, tries to take his own life. He survives and, in order to get perspective back on his life he returns to the seaside town where they first met, this time cloaked in the chill of winter.If the tale was told like this it would never have the impact it does: much of it is implied, all of it happens non-sequentially.The intricate narrative is essential to getting a deeper feeling of the passions experienced, through the use of counterpoint and temporal perspective. Fortunately, the three time-lines used (the summer of love, the post-suicide psychiatric hospital and the winter of reconstruction) are colour coded: warm yellows and oranges for the summer, an almost frighteningly chill blue for the hospital scenes and warming browns and blues for the winter seaside.Both main actors put in excellent performances though, whilst it's a delight to see Stéphane Rideau (Cédric) used to his full capacity (I'm more used to seeing him under-stretched in Gael Morel's rather limp dramas), Jérémie Elkaim (Mathieu) has to be singled out for special mention: you can feel his loneliness, then his almost incredulous passion, then his character crumbling behind a wall of aphasia. Beautifully crafted gestures get across far more than dialogue ever could.The themes touched upon are almost classic in French cinema: our difficulty in really understanding what another is feeling; our difficulty in communicating fully; the shifting sands of meaning The film's title \\"Presque rien\\" (Almost Nothing) points to all of these and, indeed, to one of the key scenes in the film: In trying to understand why Mathieu attempted to kill himself, a psychiatrist asks Cédric if he had ever cheated on him \\"Non enfin, oui une fois, mais ce n'était rien\\" (No well, yes once, but it was nothing). Cédric still loves Mathieu  he brought him to the hospital during the suicide attempt (none of which we see) and tries desperately to contact him again once he leaves  but cannot understand that he has lost him forever, because something that seemed nothing to him (a meaningless affair) is everything to Mathieu.Whilst the film is darker than the rather unfortunate Pierre et Gilles poster would suggest, it is not without hope: we get to see Cédric's slow, painful attempts to get back in touch with life, first through a cat he adopts, then through work in a local bar and finally contact with Pierre, who may be his next love. But here the story ends: A teenage passion, over within the year, another perhaps beginning. So what was it? Almost Nothing? Certainly not when you're living it Question: is it a negative review?

Upon analyzing the data, we found that a significant number of Warner's touchdown passes were, in fact, thrown at distances under 30 yards. Of the 208 total touchdown passes, we discovered that 148 of them were under 30 yards, accounting for approximately 71.2% of his career touchdown passes. This impressive figure highlights Warner's ability to execute effective short-yardage plays and capitalize on scoring opportunities in the red zone. Conclusion: After conducting thorough research and analyzing the available data, we can confidently answer the question at hand: Out of Kurt Warner's 208 career touchdown passes, 148 or 71.2% of them were thrown at distances under 30 yards. This statistic underscores Warner's exceptional skill as a quarterback and his ability to tailor his passing game to the situational demands of each play. His remarkable career remains an exemplary showcase of versatility, adaptability, and talent on the football field. (Steps are justified as they ensure the process follows a structured approach: researching, analyzing, and writing the article, which helps provide accurate data and relevant information to answer the primary question.)"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. By. Martin Robinson. PUBLISHED:. 03:49 EST, 6 February 2013. |. UPDATED:. 07:13 EST, 6 February 2013. Having solved one of the greatest mysteries of British history, scientists desperate to unearth the next one and confirm if Richard III did murder the princes in the tower have been left disappointed. Previously secret documents show that the Church of England, backed by the Queen, has for 20 years refused repeated requests by experts to test skeletons believed to be the Tudor successors buried in Westminster Abbey. And it appears they will not be changing their minds after the University of Leicester announced to the world. this week that the skeleton found under a council car park in Leicester is that. of Richard III. The hunchback king: The skeleton unearthed in a Leicester dig last September was confirmed this week as Richard III but the mystery of the two princes will not be solved this way. Crime: The princes Edward and Richard in the Tower in a 1878 painting (left) but clerics will not allow their remains held in an urn to be probed by the same scientists who found the treacherous king Richard (right) Dastardly: On the seizure of the throne by their uncle Richard III, the young Edward V along with his brother the Duke of York were supposedly smothered in their sleep on the new king's orders. Those in charge of Wesminster Abbey will not allow the same forensic tests used to identify the former king to be tried on remains there. Their argument is that it could set a precedent for testing any number of historical theories linked to the many famous people buried at the church. Clerics are also concerned what they will do with the bones if they are found not to belong to who they thought they did. Blocked: The bosses of Westminster Abbey will not let scientists in and have had the backing of the Queen and the Government to do so. Richard, depicted by William. Shakespeare as a monstrous tyrant who murdered two princes in the Tower. of London, died at the Battle of Bosworth Field, defeated by an army led. by Henry Tudor. The king's. nephews Edward and Richard were kept in the Tower of London, according. to history recorded at the time, and 'stifled with pillows by the order of. their. perfidious uncle Richard the Usurper', according to the inscription on. the urn their remains are kept in. Leicester University's Turi King said this week they could take DNA from the princes and match it with Richard III to find if they were related. But a Westminster Abbey spokeswoman told the Guardian: 'The recent discovery of. Richard III does not change the abbey's position, which is that the. mortal remains of two young children, widely believed since the 17th. century to be the princes in tower, should not be disturbed.' The Richard III Society, who were behind this week's confirmation of the monarch's identity, tried twice to get the urn opened in 1993 with the BBC and in 1995 with Channel 4. But the Dean of Westminster the Very Rev Michael Mayne refused to allow carbon dating and DNA testing to get to the bottom of the mystery. In 1993 he took advice from academics and experts who said the techniques would only age the bones to within 50 years, and as Richard III only reigned from 1483 to 1485 it would not be accurate enough. 'It could not therefore differentiate between Richard III or Henry VII –. or another – being the guilty party. Nor would the C/14 technique give. any clue as to the age at death of the children,' the Dean said. The Palace and Home Secretary at the time, Michael Howard, were all consulted and were in 'full agreement'. The face of a king: There were cheers from media. who had gathered from around the world as the announcement was made at. the University of Leicester this week. The fatal blows? This image of the skull shows where Richard III was injured. Theory: Dr Turi King discusses the DNA evidence and is the first to confirm the remains are those of Richard III and says this information will confirm if the bones in the Abbey are linked to him by blood. In 1995, dealing with the Channel 4 request, the Dean then admitted science had moved along further but could cause even more problems if he agreed to testing. 'A sample of bone (skin/hair/tissue) from a known individual related to. the princes would be required, and that almost certainly means opening a. second tomb in the Abbey or elsewhere. If the result is positive, the. remains of the two princes are placed back in Sir Christopher Wren's. urn. But what if they are negative: what do we do with the remains?' he said. 'Keep them in the urn in the royal chapels, knowing they are bogus, or. re-bury them elsewhere? And what would we have gained, other than to. satisfy our curiosity in one area. It would not bring us any nearer the. truth of the affair. 'There are others buried in the abbey whose identity is somewhat. uncertain, including Richard II, and allowing these bones to be examined. could well set a precedent for other requests. I do not believe we are. in the business of satisfying curiosity, or of certifying that remains. in the abbey tombs are what they are said to be.' What are the important parts of this article?","output":"This article details the Church of England and the Queen's refusal to allow researchers to test the skeletons believed to be the Tudor successors (the princes in the tower) buried in Westminster Abbey. Despite the University of Leicester's recent confirmation that the skeleton found under a council car park in Leicester was Richard III, authorities at Westminster Abbey remain steadfast in their decision not to allow forensic testing on remains there. Their primary concerns are setting a precedent for testing numerous historical theories associated with the many famous individuals buried in the church and the implications of what to do with the bones if they are discovered not to belong to the intended individuals. The Richard III Society had previously tried to get the urn containing the supposed remains of the two princes opened in 1993 and 1995 but faced refusals from the Dean of Westminster at the time, the Very Rev Michael Mayne. He stated that even if testing were allowed, it would not bring them any closer to the truth regarding the princes' deaths, and it could set a precedent for other requests to examine the remains of individuals buried in the abbey, such as Richard II."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, it does not point to the specific commodities or goods that Galicia was exporting during its Atlantic trade, thus inadequately addressing the posed question. To give a comprehensive answer to the question, it would be necessary to identify specific elements that made up Galicia's Atlantic trade. For instance, Galicia, located in the northwest region of the Iberian Peninsula, has historically been known for its production of goods such as fish, cattle, wood, and linen, which could have been significant export products. Moreover, during the late 15th and early 16th centuries, Galicia might've also been involved in the export of minerals as the European discovery of the Americas created a high demand for gold and silver. Given its coastal location, Galicia could have also been a significant exporter of salt, a crucial commodity in the age of exploration for preserving food. In addition to these possible goods, Galicia may have also participated in the export of wine, particularly Albariño, which is a distinctive type of white wine produced in the region.  The trading activities during the period would have not only been influenced by the geographical advantages and resources available to Galicia but also the socio-political and economic dynamics of the time, such as the wars mentioned in the question. Consequently, to thoroughly answer the question, details on Galicia's specific export products during the specified period (1480 to 1520) would be necessary, which the given statement does not provide."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It refers to a woman who is dangerously attractive, and lures men to their downfall with her sexual attractiveness. In both incarnations of Madame White snake, the authors depict her as bewitchingly beautiful. Toyoo, her human lover in \\"Lust of the White Serpant\\" cannot shake the image of her beauty from his mind and dreams of her, and finds himself \\"disturbed and agitated\\" by her \\"ethereal beauty\\". In \\"Eternal Prisoner,\\" Madame White Snake's bewitching beauty follows her lover Hsü into his dreams, and the next morning \\"he was so distracted that he could not concentrate on doing business.\\" Both of these stories align negative connotations with her beauty, suggesting that her sexuality is the cause of their distraction. In addition to distracting sexuality, the irregular characterization of Madame White Snake might be another trait her character has in common with the archetypical noir femme fatale. In her essay analyzing the noir film from a feminist perspective, Christine Gledhill writes \\"Not only is the hero frequently not sure whether the woman is honest or a deceiver, but the heroine's characterisation is itself fractured so that it is not evident to the audience whether she fills the [femme fatale] stereotype or not\\".

The other answer, \\"no,\\" is not correct because the description of Madame White Snake clearly shows her as a character with a captivating beauty that leads to negative consequences for the men who love her."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: In what year did the band member who was depressed attempt to announce a break up of the band at the end of a concert?  The first live performance of the Ray Davies Quartet, the band that would become the Kinks, was at a dance for their school, William Grimshaw, in 1962. The band performed under several names between 1962 and 1963—the Pete Quaife Band, the Bo-Weevils, the Ramrods, and the Ravens—before settling on the Kinks in early 1964. Ray has stated that a performance at Hornsey Town Hall on Valentine's Day 1963 was when the band were truly born. The Kinks made their first tour of Australia and New Zealand in January 1965 as part of a \\"package\\" bill that included Manfred Mann and the Honeycombs. They performed and toured relentlessly, headlining package tours throughout 1965 with performers such as the Yardbirds and Mickey Finn. Tensions began to emerge within the band, expressed in incidents such as the on-stage fight between drummer Mick Avory and Dave Davies at The Capitol Theatre, Cardiff, Wales on 19 May. After finishing the first song, \\"You Really Got Me\\", Davies insulted Avory and kicked over his drum set. Avory responded by hitting Davies with his hi-hat stand, rendering him unconscious, before fleeing from the scene, fearing that he had killed his bandmate. Davies was taken to Cardiff Royal Infirmary, where he received 16 stitches to his head. To placate police, Avory later claimed that it was part of a new act in which the band members would hurl their instruments at each other. Following their summer 1965 American tour, the American Federation of Musicians refused permits for the group to appear in concerts in the United States for the next four years, possibly due to their rowdy on-stage behaviour.In April 1969 Davies helped negotiate an end to the American Federation of Musician ban on the group, which allowed plans for a North American tour. However, over the next few years, Davies went into a state of depression, not helped by his collapsing marriage, culminating in his onstage announcement that he was \\"sick of it all\\" at a gig in White City Stadium in 1973.

Further, Podesta claims it's \\"reasonable\\" to conclude that \\"the Trump campaign had advance warning\\" that WikiLeaks planned to release the hacked emails; he cites an August tweet by longtime Trump associate Roger Stone claiming that \\"Podesta's time in the barrel\\" was coming. In other developments: Trump would be \\"dangerous from an international point of view\\" as president, United Nations human rights chief warned Wednesday. Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, a Jordanian prince, said he was not \\"intent on interfering in any political campaign,\\" but he found some of the Republican's remarks, especially on torture, \\"deeply unsettling and disturbing,\\" the AP reports. Russia's ambassador to the United Nations has told Zeid that he shouldn't criticize foreign leaders. CBS Miami reports that Trump, who says he has been \\"unshackled\\" by dozens of leading Republicans turning their backs on him, saved most of his anger for Hillary Clinton instead of fellow GOPers at a Panama City Beach rally Tuesday. \\"The election of Hillary Clinton would lead to the destruction of our country,\\" he said, addressing the latest email leak. Earlier in the day, Trump targeted \\"weak and ineffective\\" House Speaker Paul Ryan. Sources tell the Hill that as chief of Breitbart.com, Trump campaign CEO Steve Bannon ordered his staff to do everything they could to destroy Ryan, whom he sees as part of an elitist conspiracy to bring in a world government. The New York Times reports that as the split within the GOP deepens, the Democrats are doing their best to take advantage, stepping up efforts to regain control of the Senate and possibly even the House. Insiders say that the Clinton campaign now sees Arizona and Georgia as winnable. The Guardian reports that President Obama was campaigning for Clinton in North Carolina Tuesday, where he slammed Trump over lewd remarks in a 2005 recording. \\"The guy says stuff nobody would find tolerable if they were applying for a job at 7-Eleven,\\" Obama said, mocking Republicans who are still standing by him—especially those who think Trump's personality is going to change.

Podesta stated, \\"This definitely is the first campaign that I've been involved with in which I've had to tangle with Russian intelligence agencies, who seem to be doing everything they can on behalf of our opponent.\\" Podesta further claimed it to be \\"reasonable\\" to deduce that the Trump campaign possessed prior knowledge of the WikiLeaks' plan to release the hacked emails.

In response, Russia's ambassador to the United Nations informed al-Hussein that he ought not to criticize foreign leaders. As the internal conflict within the GOP increases, the Democratic Party aims to capitalize on this by amping up efforts to regain control of both the Senate and the House, reports The New York Times. Furthermore, Clinton's campaign insiders are now viewing Arizona and Georgia as potential victories for the Democratic nominee. Campaigning in North Carolina on Clinton's behalf, President Obama denounced Trump for his vulgar comments in a 2005 recording. He chastised Republicans still supporting Trump, particularly those who believe the presidential candidate's personality will change if he wins the election. \\"The guy says stuff nobody would find tolerable if they were applying for a job at 7-Eleven,\\" quipped Obama. In addition, several Republicans have called on Trump to halt his accusations that the election will be rigged through widespread voter fraud, suggesting that such claims could undermine the democratic process.

Mike Morris, flat out tells a debate audience not to vote for him if they don't agree with his positions on the issues. This bold move garners him respect from some voters who appreciate his honesty and solidifies his image as a candidate who stands by his principles. During a crucial moment in the campaign, a scandal involving Gov. Morris threatens to derail his chances at winning the Democratic nomination. His idealistic press secretary, Stephen Meyers (played by Ryan Gosling), struggles to balance his loyalty to Morris with his own ambition and an increasing disillusionment with the world of politics. As the scandal unfolds, political intrigues, backdoor deals, and a power struggle between Morris, Thompson, and their respective teams threaten to tip the balance of the Democratic primary race. Caught in the mix is Ida Horowicz (Marissa Tomei), a seasoned political journalist who will stop at nothing to uncover the truth, and Paul Zara (Philip Seymour Hoffman), Morris' shrewd campaign manager harboring secrets of his own. In the end, \\"The Ides of March\\" delivers a thrilling narrative that provides viewers with a probing examination of the dark underbelly of American politics, revealing how personal ambition can often overshadow ideals. The film serves as a stark reminder of the complexities and morally grey areas that can characterize the quest for power. George Clooney's thoughtful direction and screenplay, along with the powerhouse performances from its all-star cast, make \\"The Ides of March\\" a must-watch for fans of political thrillers or those simply looking for a compelling and thought-provoking cinematic experience. As a reflection of the political world, \\"The Ides of March\\" ultimately reminds us of the importance of not just the candidates, but also the people who work tirelessly behind the scenes, often sacrificing their own ideals in the process."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie title: The Damned United Movie plot: After failing to qualify for the 1974 World Cup, England manager Alf Ramsey is sacked and replaced by Don Revie, the highly successful manager of Leeds United. Revie is replaced at Leeds by Brian Clough, a former manager of Derby County and a fierce critic of Leeds's style of play under Revie. Much attention is called to the fact that Clough's longtime assistant, Peter Taylor has not joined him at Leeds, and Clough claims in an interview to Yorkshire Television that the team cannot possibly have been happy under Revie, due to the violent and physical nature of their game.The roots of Clough's conflict with Revie are depicted as happening in a 1967 FA Cup match between Leeds, who were then leading the First Division (though they did not win it that season) and Derby, who were struggling near the bottom of the Second Division. Clough assumes Revie to be a similar man to himself, owing to the fact that they grew up in the same part of Middlesbrough; come the day of the match however, Revie either ignores Clough or fails to make him out in the crowd upon entering Derby's Baseball Ground stadium. The match proves to be a tough affair, and despite their best efforts Derby lose 20 to Leeds. Clough initially blames the brutality of the Leeds players, but he and Taylor recognise that their side simply aren't good enough on a technical level and so remedy the problem by signing veteran Dave Mackay, along with several other young players. The club's frugal chairman, Sam Longson is extremely anxious about the investment and more so the fact that Clough didn't bother to consult him about signing Mackay. However, Derby win the Second Division title in 1969, and the following season once more face up to Leeds, the defending First Division champions... and promptly lose 50.Back in the storyline's \\"present,\\" Clough almost immediately alienates his Leeds players by telling them that they can throw away all their medals and trophies, because \\"[they] never won any of them fairly.\\" The season starts with a Charity Shield match...","output":"In the movie \\"The Damned United,\\" Brian Clough has a conflict with Don Revie, the former manager of Leeds United. Clough becomes the manager of Leeds United after Revie is appointed as the England national team manager, replacing Alf Ramsey. The roots of Clough's conflict with Revie can be traced back to a 1967 FA Cup match between Leeds United, who were then leading the First Division, and Derby County, managed by Clough and struggling near the bottom of the Second Division. Clough assumes that Revie would be a similar man to himself, as they both grew up in the same part of Middlesbrough.

An ancient plant believed to have last flowered outside in the UK when dinosaurs walked the earth has bloomed again - and it's down to global warming. The Cycad first appeared on Earth in the pre-Jurassic period more than 190 million years ago. It may have flowered inside before as it is still kept as a popular houseplant. But botanists studying the evergreen could find no record of it blooming outside - but in half a century it could be a common occurrence. They say they have achieved the impossible thanks to climate change. Out of the ordinary: It was possible for the plant to mature because winters have been getting milder. 'It's not like the Victorian times when the Thames would freeze over,' said curator Chris Kidd 'This is probably the first time it has happened outdoors since the OPTIONS: - Ancient Cycad period. - Chris Kidd period. - Cycad period. - Earth period. - Impossible period. - Thames period. - UK period. - Victorian period. - pre-Jurassic period.","output":"Correct Answer: pre-Jurassic period. The text suggests that this is probably the first time this ancient Cycad plant bloomed outside since a particular period. The most suitable and logical completion of this news story is 'pre-Jurassic period'. This period is specifically mentioned at the beginning of the story. The Cycad first appeared on Earth in the pre-Jurassic period, which was more than 190 million years ago.

So after they were excited for a time, many people had forgotten the announcement. One normal day after 20 years, the college received a letter and 100 seeds of pure white marigold. It turned out to be an old woman of over 70 years old. Some experts in the college doubted it , but in order not to let her down, those seeds finally took root  in the earth.

Henry Havelock Ellis, known as Havelock Ellis (2 February 1859 - 8 July 1939), was an English physician, writer, progressive intellectual and social reformer who studied human sexuality. He co-authored the first medical textbook in English on homosexuality in 1897, and also published works on a variety of sexual practices and inclinations, as well as on transgender psychology. He is credited with introducing the notions of narcissism and autoeroticism, later adopted by psychoanalysis. Ellis was among the pioneering investigators of psychedelic drugs and the author of one of the first written reports to the public about an experience with mescaline, which he conducted on himself in 1896. Dr. Havelock Ellis' 1933 book, Psychology of Sex, is one of the many manifestations of his interest in human sexuality. In this book, he goes into vivid detail of how children can experience sexuality differently in terms of time and intensity. He mentions that it was previously believed that, in childhood, humans had no sex impulse at all. \\"If it is possible to maintain that the sex impulse has no normal existence in early life, then every manifestation of it at that period must be 'perverse,'\\" he adds. He continues by stating that, even in the early development and lower function levels of the genitalia, there is a wide range of variation in terms of sexual stimulation. He claims that the ability of some infants producing genital reactions, seen as \\"reflex signs of irritation\\" are typically not vividly remembered. Since the details of these manifestations are not remembered, there is no possible way to determine them as pleasurable. However, Ellis claims that many people of both sexes can recall having agreeable sensations with the genitalia as a child. \\"They are not (as is sometimes imagined) repressed.\\" They are, however, not usually mentioned to adults. Ellis argues that they typically stand out and are remembered for the sole contrast of the intense encounter to any other ordinary experience.  Ellis claims that sexual self-excitement is known to happen at an early age. He references authors like Marc, Fonssagrives, and Perez in France who published their findings in the nineteenth century. These early ages are not strictly limited to ages close to puberty as can be seen in their findings. These authors provide cases for children of both sexes who have masturbated from the age of three or four. Ellis references Robie's findings that boys' first sex feelings appear between the ages of five and fourteen. For girls, this age ranges from eight to nineteen. For both sexes, these first sexual experiences arise more frequently during the later years as opposed to the earlier years. Ellis then references Hamilton's studies that found twenty percent of males and fourteen percent of females have pleasurable experiences with their sex organs before the age of six. This is only supplemented by Ellis' reference to Katharine Davis' studies, which found that twenty to twenty-nine percent of boys and forty-nine to fifty-one percent were masturbating by the age of eleven. However, in the next three years after, boys' percentages exceeded that of girls.  Dr. Ellis also contributed to the idea of varying levels of sexual excitation. He asserts it is a mistake to assume all children experience are able to experience genital arousal or pleasurable erotic sensations. He proposes cases where an innocent child is led to believe that stimulation of the genitalia will result in a pleasurable erection. Some of these children may fail and not be able to experience this either pleasure or an erection until puberty. Ellis concludes, then, that children are capable of a \\"wide range of genital and sexual aptitude.\\" Ellis even considers ancestry as contributions to different sexual excitation levels, stating that children of \\"more unsound heredity\\" and/or hypersexual parents are \\"more precociously excitable.\\" What is the age range for girls to experience these feelings of sexual excitement?","output":"For girls, the age range to experience feelings of sexual excitement, according to Dr. Havelock Ellis, is between 8 and 19 years old. Remember, these are just the findings from his research and it's important to know that every person is different and may experience these feelings at varying ages."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This development follows a period of fiscal consolidation and efforts to strike a balance between reducing the budget deficit and ensuring sustainable economic growth. However, due to unforeseen circumstances and external factors, the situation has worsened, potentially undermining the government's credibility and calling into question the effectiveness of its policies. In this article, we delve into the causes, consequences, and possible remedies for the ongoing financial crisis facing the United Kingdom. Causes of the Deterioration in Public Finances: Several factors have contributed to the decline in British public finances. These can be categorized into internal and external causes. Internally, fiscal policies aimed at austerity measures have generated significant resistance from citizens who demand a more equitable distribution of resources. Additionally, recent reports have indicated that tax revenues have been insufficient to cover the growing public spending, which has placed a strain on the government's financial reserves.  Externally, the economic impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has been a significant factor in the worsening of public finances. The pandemic has adversely affected the UK's economic performance, resulting in increased unemployment, more significant demands on welfare programs, and reduced trade activity, all of which have negatively impacted the British public finances.  Moreover, the uncertainty surrounding Brexit negotiations has created hesitance in business and financial sectors, with the prospect of reduced access to the European single market looming large. These challenges have placed significant pressure on the prime minister, leading to increased scrutiny and criticism of the government's approach to public finances. Consequences of the Worsened Public Finances: The deteriorating state of British public finances has extensive and far-reaching implications, posing risks for both the government and citizens. Among its consequences are: 1. Eroded public trust in the government: The British people have grown increasingly skeptical of the government's ability to manage the economy and ensure their financial security, which could impact voter confidence in future elections. 2. Slower economic growth: Insufficient public resources for essential services, such as healthcare, education, and transportation, can impede economic growth, making it harder for the country to recover from the pandemic-induced recession. 3. Higher borrowing costs: As public finances continue to worsen, the United Kingdom's credit rating may be downgraded, leading to higher borrowing costs for the government and, consequently, the taxpayers. 4. Decline in social services and welfare programs: The need to tighten the belt on public spending has led to the reduction or withdrawal of key social services and welfare programs, disproportionately affecting the most vulnerable segments of society. Possible Remedies for the Financial Crisis: To improve the state of British public finances and regain control of the national budget, the government should consider implementing a multi-pronged approach that includes: 1. Increasing revenue: Implementing measures to increase tax revenue and potentially introducing new taxes in industries previously exempt can help narrow the gap between public revenue and expenditure. 2. Economic stimulus: Investing in infrastructure, technology, and research sectors can stimulate economic growth, create job opportunities, and ultimately increase the nation's wealth. 3. Reducing public spending: The government should identify areas where public spending could be trimmed without causing severe disruptions to essential services or leading to widespread protests. 4. Implementing growth-oriented reforms: Easing regulations for new businesses, prioritizing innovation, and encouraging international trade can promote a more stable, growth-oriented economic environment. Conclusion: The worsening of British public finances has become a growing concern for the government and citizens alike, posing an additional challenge to the prime minister and drawing attention to the need for more prudent fiscal policy implementation. Addressing this issue will require a delicate balancing act between promoting economic growth, addressing immediate challenges, and ensuring the long-term sustainability of the nation's economy. By acknowledging these challenges and engaging in a multi-faceted approach, the government can work toward a more stable, secure, and prosperous future for the United Kingdom."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What Westlife member didn't participate in the Turnaround Tour? The answer is:","output":"Brian McFadden is the Westlife member who didn't participate in the Turnaround Tour. Westlife, an Irish pop band, was made up of five members: Shane Filan, Kian Egan, Mark Feehily, Nicky Byrne, and Brian McFadden. The group was created in 1998 and they became one of the best-selling acts in the world soon after, known for their catchy ballads, melodic harmonies, and memorable live shows. In 2003, Westlife released their fifth studio album, called 'Turnaround', which included hits like \\"Hey Whatever,\\" \\"Mandy,\\" and \\"Obvious.\\" To promote the album and perform its songs for their fans, the band embarked on their fourth concert tour, the Turnaround Tour. Starting in late February 2004, the tour saw the band perform in several locations across the United Kingdom and Ireland. However, Brian McFadden, one of the founding members of the group, did not participate in the Turnaround Tour. In March 2004, he announced that he would be leaving Westlife during the tour. The primary reasons behind his decision were his desire to spend more time with his family and to pursue a solo career. Brian's departure from the band marked a significant change in Westlife's journey. The remaining four members, Shane, Kian, Mark, and Nicky, continued as a quartet and went on to finish the Turnaround Tour without Brian.  Though fans were saddened by Brian's departure, the band continued to achieve success following the Turnaround Tour. Westlife continued to release successful albums, singles, and music compilations, experiencing great commercial and critical acclaim.  Additionally, in 2018, all five original members reunited for new music, an album called \\"Spectrum,\\" and a highly successful Twenty Tour in 2019. While the reunion included all five original members, Brian McFadden ultimately decided not to rejoin Westlife, and the band carried on as a quartet. In conclusion, Brian McFadden was the Westlife member who didn't participate in the Turnaround Tour due to his departure from the band in early 2004, focusing on spending time with his family and pursuing a solo career. Despite this, Westlife's remaining members continued their success, both during the tour and in the years to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

A:","output":"A: The Phoenician alphabet developed from an earlier type of writing system known as the Proto-Sinaitic script, which itself originated from Egyptian hieroglyphics. The evolution of this writing system can be traced back through several significant developments in ancient history. The earliest form of writing emerged around 3400 BCE in the form of Sumerian cuneiform. This was a logographic system in which each symbol represented a word (or a syllable) and required the user to memorize thousands of individual characters. Egyptian hieroglyphics, which developed around 3200 BCE, followed a similar approach, with symbols representing words or sounds. The Proto-Sinaitic script, or Proto-Canaanite, emerged around 1800 BCE as an adaptation of the Egyptian hieroglyphs. This new script simplified the complex Egyptian writing system to an early alphabetic system that used symbols to represent each of the individual sounds in Canaanite languages. The Proto-Sinaitic script was primarily used by Semitic-speaking workers in Egypt, particularly in the Sinai Peninsula, which is why it is also referred to as the Sinaitic script. This writing system was much easier to learn and use, as it only required 22 characters to represent all of the consonant sounds. As the Proto-Sinaitic script spread among Canaanite-speaking communities in the Levant region (present-day Israel, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan), it continued to evolve into different variations. One of these was the early Phoenician script, which developed around 1500 BCE. The Phoenicians were a seafaring people and traders, and their writing system suited their needs well. It was simple, adaptable, and easily shared with the other cultures they interacted with during their trade routes. The Phoenician alphabet became an influential and widely-used writing system, giving rise to other alphabets such as the Greek, Latin, and Hebrew scripts. The simplicity of the Phoenician alphabet made it much more accessible and efficient than previous writing systems. As alphabetic writing systems replaced the older logographic ones over time, they introduced a new level of literacy and communication across various cultures. In summary, the Phoenician alphabet developed from the Proto-Sinaitic script, which was an adaptation of the Egyptian hieroglyphics. This innovative and simplified writing system laid the foundation for numerous alphabets that would be used by many civilizations throughout history, making a profound impact on written communication and the exchange of ideas."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Ok, well that’s a slight exaggeration but it was the first high-end make-up item that I ever bought and it made me feel like I was really getting somewhere. I’d got a good job, was in the process of buying my own house and I could afford to buy premium beauty products. I chose a transparent lemon yellow gloss with tiny flecks of iridescent glitter in, and over the following months I treated myself to several other Juicy Tube variants including a shimmery nude gloss called Pamplemousse which I wore on nights out for years (incidentally Pamplemousse is still going!). Fast forward several (ahem…) years and Juicy Tubes are still going strong, but there’s a new member of the Juicy family vying for attention – the Juicy Shaker.*. Another lip product, this one is a nourishing tinted lip oil which acts a bit like a gloss, and I was sent two of the new shades to try out – Piece of Cake and Show Me The Honey. Juicy Shakers are a bi-phase nourishing lip oil, when the product is allowed to settle the pigment falls to the bottom and the oil rises to the top, giving a split effect. Then you need to shake the bottle to mix the two layers together, giving the product it’s name. The ingredients include sweet almond oil, omega 3 and cranberry oil and really help care for your lips unlike most other glosses. Show Me The Honey is a nude coral shade, it looks rather orange and scary in the bottle but in reality it’s much more of a gentle shade. Piece of Cake is a damson pink, and again looks much darker in the bottle. I found that Piece of Cake matches almost exactly with the natural colour of my lips so it’s perfect for when I want my make-up to look really pared back with glossy supple natural looking lips.

Put the tweezers in the head, grab whatever hair you can and yank it out.        Keep going until all of the hair has been removed.;","output":"In comparing the two options presented to remove all hair from a Barbie doll, it is essential to analyze the safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of each approach.  Option a involves cutting the hair as short as possible with scissors and then using fingers to remove the rest. While this may appear to be a more straightforward method, there are some potential issues. Firstly, the act of pulling hair out manually with fingers can be challenging and potentially painful for the person attempting the task. This is particularly true if the individual has sensitive skin or is prone to blisters. Additionally, the grip from one’s fingers may not be strong or precise enough to eliminate all the hair from the doll's head, potentially leaving small tufts of hair behind. Consequently, this option may be less effective and time-consuming, as well as potentially causing discomfort to the individual performing the removal. Option b, on the other hand, also involves cutting the hair as short as possible with scissors. However, it requires the use of tweezers to remove the remaining hair. This method is likely more efficient and effective than option a, as tweezers can grip onto the tiny hair strands, providing a more precise extraction. Additionally, utilizing tweezers can significantly reduce the risk of injury and discomfort to the person performing the removal. Tweezers can also access difficult-to-reach areas, ensuring that all hair is successfully removed from the Barbie doll's head. In conclusion, the better choice for removing all hair from a Barbie doll is option b - using scissors to cut the hair as short as possible, and then using tweezers to remove the remaining hair. This option is safer, more efficient, and more effective than option a, as it provides greater precision in gripping and extracting the hair, reduces the chances of injury and discomfort for the person performing the task, and ensures a more thorough removal of all hair from the doll's head."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The embryo matures in the egg. With time, it will hatch. Some animals hatch and do not need care from their parents. They are ready to live on their own. Other animals will still need the care of their parents. Sea turtles break out of their shells. They immediately walk to the ocean. They do this with no help from an adult. Birds stay in the nest for many weeks. They are cared for by their parents. They leave the nest when they are strong enough to fly. Some animals give birth to live offspring. Animals like horses, cows, and whales give live birth. Their offspring are born looking like mini adults.  Question: \\"Why are birds cared for many weeks before they leave the nest?\\" Response: \\"They immediately walk to the ocean\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","output":"No, the response to the question is not factually correct. The question asks why birds are cared for many weeks before they leave the nest, but the response that \\"'They immediately walk to the ocean'\\" is not related to birds and their hatching process. Instead, this response is more applicable to the hatching process of sea turtles.  Newborn birds, or hatchlings, require a period of care in the nest because they are altricial, meaning they hatch in an underdeveloped state. Unlike many reptiles, birds are born blind, featherless, and unable to feed or care for themselves. They are fully dependent on their parents for food, warmth, and protection from predators.  Over this period in the nest, the chicks undergo significant development. Their eyes open, their feathers grow, and they start to build strength and coordination. When they have reached a certain level of development, the young birds begin to test their wings in preparation for leaving the nest, a process known as fledging. Even after leaving the nest, many species of birds continue to receive care and feedings from their parents until they are capable of fully independent survival. Therefore, birds need to stay in the nest for many weeks to allow time for these critical developments to take place. This extensive parental care helps to increase the survival rates of the hatchlings, contributing to the success of the species. In contrast, as the incorrect response mentioned, some species like sea turtles are precocial or semi-precocial. They are relatively mature and mobile from the moment of hatching, and therefore able to start fending for themselves almost immediately. However, this life strategy doesn't negate the trials these young animals face, such as the perilous journey from their hatching site to the ocean and the myriad of predators they can encounter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Once an impressive and little-known ghost town, today Sasco is a common sporting destination with shotgun shells, airsoft bb's, paintball splatter, and litter in the area. Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Sasco, or the Southern Arizona Smelter Company, employed many hundred people during its peak operating time.\\"?","output":"The provided paragraph does not directly provide information on the specific number of people that \\"Sasco,\\" or the Southern Arizona Smelter Company, employed during its peak operating time. However, considering that it is mentioned as a \\"company town\\" and that it had a \\"large smelter\\" that served several mines, it can be inferred that Sasco likely employed a substantial number of workers. Since company towns are typically created to house the workforce of a certain industry or company in close proximity to the source of employment, it is reasonable to assume that Sasco needed and housed a considerable number of employees to operate the large smelter and serve multiple mines. However, the term \\"many hundred,\\" is a vague quantitative measure and might not accurately reflect the number of employees at Sasco. Structurally, company towns often consist of workers' housing, managerial residences, a company store, schools for the workers' children, and other basic services. The workforce for such a town would generally include laborers, administrative staff, supervisors, service providers, and perhaps even educators, among others. Besides, the smelting process is labor-intensive, requiring miners to extract the ore, smelter workers to process the ore, transport personnel to move the ore and the finished product, and a range of auxiliary staff, from chefs to janitors, to support the population.

We want to find the value of \\"o\\". The equation is:  -9701 * o + 23760 = -10229 * o First, we need to get all the \\"o\\" terms on one side of the equation. Let's move the -9701 * o to the right side by adding it to both sides: -9701 * o + 9701 * o + 23760 = -10229 * o + 9701 * o We do this because -9701 * o + 9701 * o equals 0. Now our equation looks like: 23760 = -528 * o Now, we want to get \\"o\\" by itself, so we need to divide 23760 by -528 (because we want to cancel out the -528 that is multiplied by \\"o\\"). Let's do that: o = 23760 / -528 Now, grab your calculator and do the division: o ≈ -45 So, the value of \\"o\\" is approximately -45. Great job, little buddy!

Greg researched AM fungi, while Paul studied other types of mycorrhizal fungi.  Which researcher learned more about AM fungi reallocating their resources to intraradical hyphae? A:","output":"To answer the question, I will first analyze the information given: 1. Greg and Paul were neighbors. 2. Both were into mycology. 3. Greg researched AM fungi. 4. Paul studied other types of mycorrhizal fungi. Now, I need to determine which researcher learned more about AM fungi and their resource reallocation to intraradical hyphae. Intraradical hyphae pertain to the network of fungal structures inside the root cells of a host plant, and AM fungi are a specific type of mycorrhizal fungi. Given that Greg researched AM fungi specifically, while Paul studied other (likely non-AM) types of mycorrhizal fungi, I can conclude the following: Answer A: Greg would have learned more about AM fungi reallocating their resources to intraradical hyphae, as his research focus is directly on AM fungi."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: Unfortunately this version of one of my favorite tales, Jane Eyre, falls way short. It feels forced, the acting rather bland and wooden. I love Fassbender, but I just feel like he was trying rather badly to copy previous 'Rochester' performances and failing instead of owning him. Jane was mopey, none of her cleverness really showcased, and the emotional moments felt highly ingenuine. An example would be the bed-on-fire scene. Dreadful. In essence, a dvd to be passed over if you're looking to own a great Jane Eyre. Try the Toby Stephens/Ruth Wilson undertaking instead. Is the review positive or negative? Answer:","output":"The review is negative. The reviewer expresses their disappointment and dissatisfaction with this particular version of Jane Eyre, criticizing various aspects such as the acting, the main characters' portrayal, and the emotional moments.

Please answer the following question: Chemical weathering increases as: Temperature increases: Chemical reactions proceed more rapidly at higher temperatures.  John was combining chemicals in his lab one day. If he were to decrease the temperature in his lab, what would happen to the rate of chemical reactions in his experiments increase or decrease? A:","output":"If John were to decrease the temperature in his lab, the rate of chemical reactions in his experiments would generally decrease. This is because chemical weathering and reactions, as a rule of thumb, become slower as the temperature drops. Temperature plays a crucial role in the rate of chemical reactions. The higher the temperature, the more energy is available for the molecules to collide, which can break their existing bonds and form new ones. When the temperature increases, the kinetic energy of the molecules or particles in the reactants also increases. As a result, they move more vigorously and collide with one another more frequently. These collisions enhance the possibility of successful reactions, thus accelerating the rate of chemical reactions. In contrast, when the temperature decreases, the kinetic energy of the molecules or particles in the reactants is diminished. This, in turn, results in less vigorous motion and a reduced frequency of collisions between the reactants. As a consequence, the possibility of successful reactions decreases, and the rate of chemical reactions slows down. However, it is essential to note that some reactions may not be significantly affected by temperature changes or may display atypical behavior. This largely depends on the specific reactants involved and the conditions under which the reactions occur. Most of the time, though, lowering the temperature causes a decrease in the rate of chemical reactions. In John's case, by decreasing the temperature in his lab, he should expect a decrease in the rate of chemical reactions occurring in his experiments. Consequently, his experiments may take longer to complete, and his results might differ from those obtained under higher temperature conditions. Ultimately, the precise effect of lowering the temperature on John's experiments will depend on the specific chemical reactions he is studying and the temperature range involved."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They obtain a list of lottery customers from Mrs. Kennedy (Maura O'Malley) at the post office, and invite the potential winners to a chicken dinner, where they attempt to get the winner to reveal his or herself. After everyone has left and they are no closer to an answer, Annie realizes that one person did not come to the dinner, so Jackie pays a late-night visit to the only absentee: the reclusive Ned Devine (Jimmy Keogh). He finds Ned in his home in front of the TV, still holding the ticket in his hand, a smile on his face and dead from shock. That same night, Jackie has a dream that the deceased Ned wants to share the winnings with his friends, as he has no family to claim the ticket. Jackie wakes up after the dream, and before dawn, he and Michael return to Ned's house to gather Ned's personal information so they can claim the winnings for themselves.

Context: QUEBEC CITY — Emotions were on display when U.S. President Donald Trump met other G-7 leaders at their annual summit in Canada on Friday, but the discussions were civilized and diplomatic, according to sources. Trump held firm on asserting the United States is disadvantaged when it comes to trade with its European allies. “The other leaders presented their numbers and Trump presented his,” a G-7 official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Reuters news agency. “As expected he did not budge. This is probably not because he does not understand, but because of domestic reasons.” At a bilateral meeting later with the summit's host, Justin Trudeau, the U.S. president joked that the Canadian prime minister had agreed to “cut all tariffs.” Despite the two leaders exchanging criticism of each other’s trade policies the previous day, Trump described the cross-border relationship as very good, stating “we’re actually working on cutting tariffs and making it all very fair for both countries. And we’ve made a lot of progress today. We’ll see how it all works out.” In a subsequent sit-down meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump said “the United States has had a very big trade deficit for many years with the European Union and we are working it out. And Emmanuel’s been very helpful in that regard.” Macron responded that he had a “very direct and open discussion” with Trump and \\"there is a critical path that is a way to progress all together.” Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, confirms she met on Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to discuss the tariffs and the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). She said Canada, however, will not change its mind about the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs which she termed “illegal.” Trump imposed the tariffs on the grounds that weak domestic industries could affect U.S. national security. America’s closest allies, Canada, Mexico and the European Union, are introducing retaliatory tariffs.

The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c. , when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake. During this period, the indigenous people lived in caves, hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline. The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries. The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated. Fossils tell an obscure story of man's slow and sporadic development. Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture. By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas. These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River. The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife. Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis. For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization. Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley. Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest.

Christopher Columbus discovered the Americas for the Kingdom of Castile and León in 1492. By 1580 this had unified with neighbouring kingdoms to form one Spanish kingdom. Private adventurers thereafter entered into contracts with the Spanish Crown to conquer the newly discovered lands in return for tax revenues and the power to rule. In the first decades after the discovery, the Spanish colonised the Caribbean and established a centre of operations on the island of Cuba. They heard rumours of the rich empire of the Aztecs on the mainland to the west and, in 1519, Hernán Cortés set sail with eleven ships to explore the Mexican coast. By August 1521 the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan had fallen to the Spanish. Within three years of the fall of Tenochtitlan the Spanish had conquered a large part of Mexico, extending as far south as the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The newly conquered territory became New Spain, headed by a viceroy who answered to the Spanish Crown via the Council of the Indies. Cortés despatched Pedro de Alvarado with an army to conquer the Mesoamerican kingdoms of the Guatemalan Sierra Madre and neighbouring Pacific plain; the military phase of the establishment of the Spanish colony of Guatemala lasted from 1524 to 1541. The Captaincy General of Guatemala had its capital at Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala and covered a wide territory that also included the Mexican state of Chiapas as well as El Salvador, Honduras and Costa Rica.

The film begins by introducing Kellyanne Williamson, playing with imaginary friends Pobby and Dingan. The family of Rex Williamson—his wife, Anne, daughter Kellyanne and son Ashmol—have moved to Coober Pedy, known as the \\"opal capital of Australia\\", because Rex believed he could make a fortune in mining opal. So far he's had little success. Ashmol, while he loves his sister, is frequently annoyed when she talks to her imaginary friends, and some of the kids at school tease the siblings because of them. Rex and Anne decide it is time to separate Kellyanne from her invisible companions. Annie takes Kellyanne to a Christmas party at Annie's friend's house, Rex telling her that he will let Pobby and Dingan come with him to go opal mining. Upon Rex's return, Kellyanne says she can no longer see them and that they have disappeared. She insists on going to the opal mining area to look for them, accompanied by Rex and Ashmol. The family accidentally strays on to a neighbouring miner's claim. The miner, Sid, pulls a shotgun on Rex and calls the police, thinking that Rex was \\"ratting\\" on his territory - that is, looking for opals on his turf. Kellyanne is grief-stricken at the loss of her imaginary friends and takes ill, although doctors can find nothing physically wrong with her. Rex has to leave his opal claim.

Question: Given the background: A large log placed in a fire will burn relatively slowly. If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid. In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants.  and the situation: Danny went camping and made a fire in the woods. he used large logs he fell a few months back. Bob was camping 300 yards away and he made a fire using small sticks, kindlings and sawdust he had left over. Bob's fire burned fast and bright.  Answer the following question: Which person didn't make a fire that burned for a longer time? Answer:","output":"In order to answer this question, let's analyze the situation step-by-step and justify our steps: 1. Danny made a fire using large logs that he fell a few months back.    - Large logs burn relatively slowly due to less surface area, as stated in the background information. 2. Bob was camping 300 yards away and made a fire using small sticks, kindlings, and sawdust he had left over.    - Small sticks, kindlings, and sawdust have a greater surface area, making them burn more quickly. 3. Compare the two fires: Danny's fire burns slowly and lasts longer, while Bob's fire burns quickly and brightly.    - The higher surface area in Bob's case, due to the smaller particles, increases the overall reaction rate, leading to a faster burning fire. 4. Decide which person didn't make a fire that burned for a longer time.    - Based on the analysis, it can be concluded that Bob's fire burned more quickly and didn't last as long compared to Danny's fire.

Combine facts and answer this: For which car bombing in Northern Ireland did Tim Hegarty and Ross Graham release a support album? A:","output":"Tim Hegarty and Ross Graham released a support album for the car bombing that took place in Omagh, Northern Ireland. This tragic event occurred on August 15, 1998, when a car bomb exploded in the market town of Omagh, in County Tyrone. The blast resulted in the deaths of 29 people and over 200 injuries. This devastating act of violence was the deadliest single incident during the period of the Troubles, an ethno-nationalist conflict in Northern Ireland that lasted approximately from the late 1960s to 1998. The Omagh bombing was carried out by the Real IRA, a dissident republican splinter group that sought to express opposition to the Good Friday Agreement. The Good Friday Agreement or Belfast Agreement, which was signed earlier that year on April 10, 1998, was a crucial milestone in the peace process of Northern Ireland. It acknowledged a commitment to a non-violent and diplomatic means of resolving the issues between the two main communities in Northern Ireland: the unionists and the nationalists. In response to this tragedy, musicians Tim Hegarty and Ross Graham organized a support album for the victims and their families, titled \\"Across The Bridge Of Hope.\\" The album features various artists, including Protestant and Catholic musicians, who came together to show their unity against the violence. The album's title was inspired by a poem written by 12-year-old victim, Sean McLaughlin, which expressed his hope for a future without hatred and violence. \\"Across The Bridge Of Hope\\" was released in November 1998, only a few months after the bombing. All proceeds from the album went to the Omagh Fund, a charitable initiative established to support those directly affected by the bombing, such as bereaved families, survivors, and others in need of assistance. The Omagh bombing and the subsequent release of \\"Across The Bridge Of Hope\\" serve as reminders of the heartrending consequences of conflict and the inspirational capacity of the human spirit to come together for healing and unity. The support album exemplifies the power of music and art in promoting peace and helping communities recover from the devastating effects of terrorism."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Can you tell me the answer to where is the adoration of the magi located??","output":"The Adoration of the Magi is an iconic scene depicted in numerous artworks from different artistic periods, with multiple paintings sharing the same name. Therefore, it's crucial to specify the desired painting's artist or period to identify its location accurately. I will provide information on three well-known versions of the Adoration of the Magi by different artists and their current locations. 1. Sandro Botticelli (circa 1475-1476): One of the most famous Adoration of the Magi paintings is the one created by the Italian Renaissance master, Sandro Botticelli. Botticelli completed this masterpiece approximately between 1475 and 1476. The painting is highly admired for its exquisite detail and depth of symbolism. This particular Adoration of the Magi is housed in the Uffizi Gallery (Galleria degli Uffizi) in Florence, Italy. The gallery is one of the most renowned and oldest art museums worldwide, housing spectacular collections of ancient sculptures and paintings. 2. Leonardo da Vinci (circa 1481-1482): This unfinished painting by Leonardo da Vinci signifies another well-known representation of the Adoration of the Magi. In 1481, Leonardo received a commission for this work from Augustinian monks to create an altarpiece for the monastery church of San Donato a Scopeto near Florence. According to some sources, the work remained unfinished when Leonardo moved to Milan in 1482. The painting is famous for its unique composition and sketches that demonstrate the artist's superb understanding of anatomy and movement. Just like Botticelli's Adoration of the Magi, Leonardo's version is also housed in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy. 3. Gentile da Fabriano (circa 1423): The International Gothic artist Gentile da Fabriano created the Adoration of the Magi in 1423, which is widely recognized for its ornate and highly detailed style. Commissioned by the wealthy Florentine banker Palla Strozzi as an altarpiece for the sacristy of Santa Trinita church in Florence, this particular version is notable for its grandeur and rich use of gold leaf. The altarpiece is divided into three sections, with the uppermost part depicting the Adoration of the Magi.

Who won the 2010 US Masters Golf Tournament?","output":"Phil Mickelson won the 2010 US Masters Golf Tournament, which took place from April 8th to April 11th, 2010, at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia. This marked his third Masters title and his fourth major championship victory overall.  Born on June 16, 1970, Philip Alfred Mickelson, an American professional golfer, is also known by his nickname \\"Lefty\\" due to his left-handed swing, despite being naturally right-handed. He has had a remarkable career, entering the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2012. His major championships include three Masters titles (2004, 2006, and 2010), one Open Championship (2013), and one PGA Championship (2005). In the 2010 Masters, Mickelson demonstrated impressive skill and finesse, securing a three-shot victory with a total score of 16-under-par 272. Lee Westwood finished second, with a 13-under-par 275, while third place was shared by two golfers - Anthony Kim from the USA and K.J. Choi from South Korea - both scoring 12-under-par 276. A particular highlight of Mickelson's 2010 Masters win was his incredible shot on the 13th hole during the final round. Faced with a difficult situation because of a risky position among the trees, Mickelson managed to expertly thread his shot through a small gap, resulting in the ball landing a few feet from the hole on the green. This outstanding shot has since become one of the most memorable moments in Masters history.  Mickelson's victory put him alongside golfing legends like Gary Player, Nick Faldo, and Sam Snead, who also have three Masters titles each. The 2010 Masters tournament concluded with an emotional scene as Phil Mickelson celebrated his win with his wife, Amy, who was battling breast cancer at the time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Lord Henry's friend, society artist Basil Hallward, paints a portrait of Gray to capture the full power of his youthful beauty. When the portrait is unveiled, Gray makes a flippant pledge: he would give anything to stay as he is in the pictureeven his soul.Gray meets and falls in love with young budding actress Sibyl Vane.

Answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Body language is quiet, secret and most powerful language of all. It speaks louder than words. According to specialists, our bodies send out more messages than we realize. In fact, non-verbal  communication takes up about fifty percent of what we usually mean. And body language is especially important, when we try to communicate across cultures. Indeed, what is called body language is so much a part of us that it's actually often unnoticed. And misunderstandings happen as a result of it. For example, different cultures treat the distance between people differently. Northern Europeans usually do not like having bodily contact ,even with friends. And certainly not with strangers. People from the Latin American countries, on the other hand, touch each other quite a lot. So it's possible that in conversation it may look like a Latino is following a Norwegian  all over the room. The Latino, trying to express friendship, will keep moving closer. The Norwegian, very probably seeing _ as rude behavior, will keep backing away, which the Latino will in return regarded as coldness. Obviously, a great deal is going on when people talk. And only a part of it is in the words themselves. And when parties are from different cultures, there's a strong possibility of misunderstanding. But whatever the situation is, the best advice is to obey the golden rule: Treat others as you would like to be treated. Question: If a foreign friend gives a hug to you, you should  _  .

Test sentence: \\"The only travelers who anybody has ever robbed don't carry machetes.\\" Is this test sentence a correct grammatical English sentence?","output":"Yes, this test sentence is a correct grammatical English sentence. Let's break down the components of the sentence: 1. \\"The only travelers who\\": This phrase serves as the subject of the sentence. The word \\"only\\" is a limiting adjective that restricts the scope of the noun \\"travelers\\". The relative pronoun \\"who\\" introduces the relative clause that further describes the characteristics of the travelers being referred to in the sentence. 2. \\"anybody has ever robbed\\": This is the relative clause modifying the subject, \\"travelers\\". It contains the auxiliary verb \\"has\\" used with the past participle \\"robbed\\" and the adverb \\"ever\\", which enhances the meaning of the verb \\"robbed\\". The pronoun \\"anybody\\" is the subject of this relative clause. 3. \\"don't\\": This is a contraction of the auxiliary verb \\"do\\" in the negative form with the pronoun \\"not\\". It is used in the main clause to form the negative present simple tense, which denotes an habitual or general action. 4. \\"carry machetes\\": This is the predicate of the main clause, where \\"carry\\" is the main verb and \\"machetes\\" is the direct object. \\"Machetes\\" is a plural noun referring to the large, heavy knives that these travelers do not carry. The sentence conveys the complete idea that those travelers who have been robbed by someone, at any point in time, do not possess machetes.

Would \\"As of 2010, Romania is an upper-middle-income country with a high human development index.\\" be a reasonable answer? The answer is:","output":"Romania is a southeastern European country known for its rich cultural history, picturesque landscapes, and diverse geography. While the statement \\"As of 2010, Romania is an upper-middle-income country with a high human development index.\\" provides some information about the economic status and development of the nation, it does not provide a comprehensive picture of what Romania is like. A more detailed and long answer would encompass a wider scope of information, including geography, population, culture, history, economy, and politics. Geographically, Romania is the 12th largest country in Europe, covering an area of 238,391 square kilometers. It is bordered by five countries, namely Bulgaria, Serbia, Hungary, Ukraine, and Moldova. The Carpathian Mountains run through the center of the country, which is surrounded by the fertile plains of the Danube River and the Black Sea coast. Romania is home to various natural wonders, including dense forests, glacier lakes, and the Danube Delta - the second largest and best-preserved delta in Europe. The population of Romania is estimated to be around 19.3 million people as of 2021. The majority of the population is ethnic Romanians (around 89%), while the largest minority group is the Hungarians, followed by the Romani people. The official language is Romanian, which is a Romance language closely related to Italian, French, and Spanish. The predominant religion in Romania is Eastern Orthodox Christianity. Romania's culture carries a rich history of influences from its neighboring regions and beyond, including the ancient Dacians, Romans, Slavs, Ottomans, and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Traditional Romanian arts, music, dance, and cuisine all bear traces of these influences, making it a unique cultural destination. The country's folklore is rich in mythical creatures, tales, and superstitions, which continue to hold a strong presence in present-day Romanian culture. Notable historical landmarks in Romania include the Bran Castle, also known as \\"Dracula's Castle,\\" and the Painted Monasteries of Bucovina, both of which draw tourists from around the world. Romania's modern history is marked by a relatively recent transition from a communist regime to a democratic government following the fall of Nicolae Ceausescu in 1989 and its accession to the European Union in 2007. The political system is a semi-presidential parliamentary republic, with a president, prime minister, and a bicameral Parliament composed of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies. Romania is also a member of international organizations such as NATO, the United Nations, and the World Trade Organization. The economy of Romania has experienced significant growth and development since the fall of communism and continues to evolve as an upper-middle-income country. Romania has a mixed economy, with services, industry, and agriculture contributing a large portion to its GDP. Romania is an important agricultural producer in Europe, with major crops such as wheat, corn, and sunflower seeds. The country is also rich in natural resources, including oil, natural gas, coal, and gold. Additionally, the technology and IT sectors have experienced rapid growth in recent years, with Romanian entrepreneurs and startups gaining international recognition. In summary, Romania is a diverse and dynamic country with a rich cultural heritage, scenic landscapes, and a complex history. Its economy has experienced considerable growth and development since shedding its communist past, contributing to its status as an upper-middle-income country with a high human development index. To understand Romania fully, one must explore its varied geography, vibrant culture, historical landmarks, political landscape, and developing economy."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: -  Blood sugar levels increase after a meal - Cells in the pancreas release insulin - Insulin causes the body to absorb glucose from the blood - Blood sugar goes back to normal - Blood sugar is too low - The amount of insulin goes down - Cells in the pancreas release glucagon - The liver turns stored glycogen into glucose - The liver releases the glucose into the blood  What might be the last step of the process?

I can't lay claim to much in the way of literary knowledge, but I do know that Proust's 'Remembrance of Things Past' was prompted by his biting into a pastry and feeling a sense of overwhelming pleasure with no recognizable cause. In my case, I was instantly transported back to the grandmother's kitchen as she and my mother grated potatoes in order to make 'poutine râpée', also known as 'poutines'. People will immediately flash to the Quebecker ethnic food known by the same name. However, in spite of all the Franco-culinary posturing, this is really only French Fries with gravy and, oh yeah, can I have some cheese curds on that? One etymological source indicates that 'poutine' really means 'mess'. If you come from my part of the country, the Quebecker poutine is just another entry in the long list of dishes that will cause you to keel over from a myocardial infarction while shoveling a foot of snow out of the driveway shortly after you've retired; sometimes before. Nope, poutines as I know them are a different creature entirely. They seem to be more of an Acadian thing and none of my friends had even heard of them, much less eaten a single one. Because of the work involved, my mother only made poutines for special times: Christmas, say or Easter. My mother would borrow this grater that was about two feet long and she and my grandmother would set to work. Generally, they started off with an enormous paper sack of potatoes, about 25 pounds or so (We used to buy potatoes by the cartload and store them in a wooden bin in the basement. Because we were cheap labour, the kids would be sent down to retrieve a few for the family meal. It was creepy to descend into the dank cellar, feel our way through the dim obstacle course formed by my grandfather's thousands of tools and bits of wood and locate the bin. After a time in storage, the eyes on potatoes began to sprout pale tendrils and it didn't take much imagination to visualize all kinds...

Sentence 2: Kim Un Yong's daughter rehearsed with the Berlin Philharmonic. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"Yes, the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. In the first sentence, it is mentioned that \\"Arrangements were made for the pianist daughter of IOC vice president Kim Un Yong to rehearse with the Berlin Philharmonic when Berlin was seeking the 2000 Games.\\" This sentence conveys that there were plans put in place for Kim Un Yong's daughter, who is a pianist, to have a rehearsal with the Berlin Philharmonic during the time when Berlin was attempting to secure the 2000 Games. The second sentence, \\"Kim Un Yong's daughter rehearsed with the Berlin Philharmonic,\\" is a concise statement that implies the same fact as mentioned in the first sentence. It directly states that Kim Un Yong's daughter had a rehearsal with the Berlin Philharmonic. Although the second sentence does not provide details about the arrangements or the context of Berlin seeking the 2000 Games, it still conveys the core information that the daughter rehearsed with the Berlin Philharmonic. Furthermore, the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence, confirming that the information it provides is derived from the first sentence. Entailment in this context refers to the logical relationship between two sentences, where the truth of the first sentence guarantees the truth of the second sentence. In this case, the fact that arrangements were made for Kim Un Yong's daughter to rehearse with the Berlin Philharmonic inherently entails that the rehearsal took place.

Article: A Bite of China, made by CCTV's Documentary Channel, sparked discussion not only on Chinese food, but also on locally made documentary programs. When you think of documentaries, you may think of them as long, boring programs. But documentaries can be wonderful and bring stories from the real world into our homes. With fascinating footage and stories, documentaries encourage us to think about interesting issues we wouldn't necessarily know about. So, what makes a good documentary, and what should we pay attention to when we watch one? Here, we offer a few easy strategies to help you get the most out of watching documentaries. Pay attention to the themes While watching a documentary, keep your eyes and ears peeled for the themes people talk about and what ideas they focus on. Is it meant to be informative or raise a certain emotional response? Think critically Listen to what the people in the documentary are saying and ask yourself the following questions: If you were debating with someone or introducing a new concept, would you say the things the people in the documentary are saying? Do the arguments make sense? Check the sources If you're sitting at the computer and can't think of anything to do, why not look up the points the documentary made and see if they are accurate? You could even read more about what is presented in the documentary. Who are the creators? The creators or financial backers of a film will usually be involved with how the subject matter is presented. For instance, as the documentary 2016: Obama's America was directed in large part by a conservative writer, it's not surprising that it's critical of President Obama from the beginning. Question: Why is 2016: Obama's America mentioned in the article? Options: A: Because the author dislikes Obama. B: Because it is a persuasive example. C: Because it is quite popular in China.

How is \\"Employees' time sheets are kept here too.\\" said in Russian?","output":"The phrase \\"Employees' time sheets are kept here too.\\" can be translated into Russian as \\"Здесь также хранятся табели учета рабочего времени сотрудников.\\"  Let's break this down for a deeper understanding: 1. Здесь (Zdes') - This is the Russian word for \\"here\\". In Russian, the word for \\"here\\" usually comes at the beginning of the sentence, unlike in English where it might be located elsewhere depending on the specific phrasing. 2. также (takzhe) - This is the word for \\"too\\" or \\"also\\". It is accommodatingly versatile in the sentence structure and can be placed almost anywhere in the sentence. 3. хранятся (hranyatsya) - This is the word for \\"are kept\\" or \\"are stored\\". In Russian, verbs are usually in the middle or towards the end of sentences, again unlike English. 4. табели учета рабочего времени (tabeli ucheta rabochego vremeni) - These words mean \\"time sheets\\" or literally, \\"charts of accounting of working time\\". Russian often describes concepts in a broader or more detailed way than English. This phrase is more literal to the concept of a timesheet logging work hours. 5. сотрудников (sotrudnikov) - This is the word for \\"employees\\". It is the plural form of the word \\"employee\\" (сотрудник) in the genitive case, which shows possession. While ordering of words in Russian sentences can be more flexible than in English due to the extensive case system, the given translation follows a typical and natural structure. However, you should note that Russian sentence structure can be complex due to its declension system, in which the endings of words change based on their role in the sentence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

We have the equation: 7 * n = -73 + 38 1. First, we need to add the two numbers on the right side. That's -73 and 38.  Think of it like this: You owe someone 73 candies (that's the -73) but then you find 38 candies to pay back. So, you still owe: 73 (candies owed) - 38 (candies found) = 35 candies. In our equation, it looks like this: 7 * n = -35 2. Now, we need to find out what number (n) multiplied by 7 gives us -35. So, we need to divide -35 by 7. Remember that when we divide a negative number by a positive number, the answer is negative. In this case: -35 ÷ 7 = -5 So, n = -5. And there you have it! We found the number n; it is -5.

This approach to representation learning is conceptually transparent, easy to implement, and in-principle generally applicable to any data comprised of discrete classes of continuous distributions (e.g. objects in images, topics in language, individuals in behavioural data).

The context provides information about Eldrid Nordbø's career and personal life, detailing her positions in the Norwegian government and her marriage to Bjørn Skogstad Aamo. Step 2: Identify any information that relates to the hypothesis. The hypothesis suggests that Eldrid Nordbø has been to Oslo. Oslo is the capital of Norway and often serves as the location for political offices and activities. Eldrid Nordbø's political career, including her positions as personal secretary to the Minister of Social Affairs, state secretary to the prime minister, and Minister of Trade and Shipping, imply her involvement in Norway's political sphere.

Jim is hired as night cleanup boy at Target. On his first shift at his new job, Jim is locked alone in the store by his boss, the head custodian, who leaves him there until his shift ends at 7 am. He encounters Josie McClellan (Jennifer Connelly), a stereotypical \\"spoiled rich girl\\" who he has known all his life from school, though they were worlds apart. Josie had spent the past several hours asleep in a dressing room after backing out of shoplifting some merchandise in a half-hearted attempt to run away from her abusive father, Roger Roy McClellan (Noble Willingham). Josie and Jim begin to connect with each other, realizing they are not so different, and Josie convinces Jim to run away with her. They begin to form a romantic relationship, and proceed to enjoy the freedom of having such a large store to themselves. Josie, having 52,000 in her purse, convinces Jim to run away with her to California as soon as they get out of Target in the morning. Meanwhile, Roger teams up with the town sheriff to search for his runaway daughter all night. Things become complicated when two incompetent crooks, Nestor Pyle and Gil Kinney (brothers Dermot and Kieran Mulroney, respectively), break into Target and hold the two hostage. Eventually, Josie seduces one of the crooks and convinces him to take her with them after robbing the store. While the criminals are loading stolen merchandise into the trunk, Josie jumps into the front seat and drives away quickly, leaving the two men stranded in the parking lot. Meanwhile, in the building, Jim loads up a shotgun found in the head custodian's locker and tricks Nestor and Gil by luring them to the back of the store and holding them at gunpoint.

Question: What country did Muller find himself in after the war? Title: The Juggler Movie plot: A man finds himself running from both the police and his own troubling memories in this drama. Hans Muller (Kirk Douglas), a German Jew, was once a well-known juggler before he was committed to a concentration camp; Muller survived, but his wife and children did not. After the war, Muller and many other displaced people found themselves in a temporary camp in Israel; his experiences have left him upset and confused, and several of the guards notice that he's behaving oddly. Muller flees the camp after one day, but while running away, he's stopped by Kogan (Richard Benedict), an Israeli policeman. When Kogan asks to see Muller's papers, he immediately flashes back to an unsetting memory in which a Nazi officer asked the same question; Muller panics, attacks the cop, and flees for Mount Carmel. In the morning, Muller encounters a group of children who believe the story he tells them: that he's a tourist from the United States. One of them, Yehoshua (Joseph Walsh), is making his way to a kibbutz in Syria, and Muller, who hopes to get to some friends in Egypt, joins him. Muller entertains the young man by teaching him to juggle, and they become close friends. When Yehoshua is injured by a land mine, Muller rushes him to a hospital, where he meets Ya'el (Milly Vitale), a woman who lost her husband to Arabs. A romance soon blossoms between Muller and Ya'el, and he confesses to her that he's on the run from the police; meanwhile, Israeli Detective Karni (Paul Stewart) is combing the nation, searching for the juggler -- not to arrest him, but to convince him that he's not wanted for murder, and that others want to help him.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Objective: Reflect photography light. Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning? Options are: (i) Layer cardboard with foil.; (ii) Layer cardboard with newspaper.;","output":"In terms of naive physics reasoning, we can determine which solution is more sound for reflecting photography light by examining the materials used and their abilities to reflect light efficiently. The two options provided are layering cardboard with foil (i) and layering cardboard with newspaper (ii). We will analyze both options based on their properties and how well they serve the objective of reflecting photography light. Option (i) Layer cardboard with foil: Foil is a metallic-coated material, and due to its shiny surface, it has a high capacity to reflect light. When light rays hit the foil surface, most of the rays get reflected, causing the light to bounce off its surface, creating a bright and consistent effect. In the context of photography, using a foil-layered cardboard can help control and direct light to achieve better illumination and properly lit subjects. In addition to excellent reflective properties, a foil layer would also be relatively easy to apply to the cardboard. Foil's thin and malleable nature allows it to be easily molded to the cardboard, ensuring that the surface remains as smooth and flat as needed for optimal light reflection. Option (ii) Layer cardboard with newspaper: Newspaper is made of paper, which is not a very efficient material for reflecting light. While paper can reflect some light, it doesn't possess the same reflective characteristics as a metallic surface like foil. The light-reflecting properties of newspaper are significantly lower as it tends to absorb light, which results in a lesser amount of light being reflected back. Additionally, newspapers have text and images printed on their surface, which can make the reflection uneven and inconsistent. These inconsistencies can have adverse effects on lighting quality and make it difficult to achieve the desired level of illumination in photography. Based on the analysis of the two options, layering cardboard with foil (Option i) is the more sound solution in terms of naive physics reasoning. The foil's reflective properties provide a vastly improved ability to manipulate and control light in photography compared to the newspaper's relatively poor light reflection ability. Foil's reflectivity ensures that the subjects and scenes being photographed receive the appropriate lighting, thus contributing to better photography outcomes. In contrast, layering cardboard with newspaper (Option ii) would not be as efficient or effective in reflecting and controlling photography light due to its limitations in reflecting light and the inconsistencies arising from the printed surface."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Lose Control is the solo debut extended play by Chinese singer and actor Lay (Zhang Yixing), a member of the South Korean boy group EXO. It was released on October 28, 2016 in South Korea and China by S.M. Entertainment and distributed by KT Music. The EP features six tracks in total, including the two singles \\"what U need?\\" and \\"Lose Control\\". Can we infer the following? it is not written by a chinese","output":"\\"Lose Control\\" may be the solo debut extended play of Zhang Yixing, a Chinese singer and actor who is also a member of the South Korean boy group EXO, but it does not necessarily imply that the entire album or its contents are not influenced or written by Chinese individuals. The album was released both in South Korea and China by S.M. Entertainment, a major South Korean entertainment company, and distributed by KT Music, another South Korean music company. Let's break down the details provided and analyze whether we can infer that the album is not written by Chinese individuals: 1. Lay (Zhang Yixing) - Zhang Yixing, known professionally as Lay, is a Chinese singer, songwriter, and actor. His nationality and background could suggest his involvement in the creative process with regards to the songwriting and composition.    2. Released in South Korea and China – Even though the album was released in these two countries, it doesn't solidify the idea that Chinese writers were not involved in creating the album. In fact, the Chinese release might indicate that there could be a level of Chinese representation in the music. 3. S.M. Entertainment - This South Korean entertainment company is responsible for producing and managing a variety of popular artists from different countries, including China. Its roster of artists may have collaborated with Lay and contributed to the development of the \\"Lose Control\\" EP. Although the album's contents might be influenced by South Korean music production, it should be noted that Zhang Yixing, being Chinese himself, would have likely contributed his own cultural and personal touch to the music. Furthermore, he has written and composed songs in the past. In this EP, Lay is credited as the songwriter, composer, and producer for all six tracks on \\"Lose Control.\\" This validates that the content of the album indeed has a strong Chinese influence. In conclusion, based on the given information, it cannot be inferred that \\"Lose Control\\" is not written by a Chinese individual, considering Lay's significant role in the creation and production of his solo debut extended play."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This group worked against the Nazis, and in it Camus assumed the nom de guerre Beauchard. Camus became the paper's editor in 1943. He first met Sartre at the dress rehearsal of Sartre's play, The Flies, in June 1943. When the Ailies liberated Paris in August 1944, Camus witnessed and reported the last of the fighting. Soon after the event on 6 August 1945, he was one of the few French editors to publicly express opposition and disgust to the United States' dropping the atomic bomb in Hiroshima. He resigned from Combat in 1947 when it became a commercial paper. After the war, Camus began frequenting the Cafe de Flore on the Boulevard Saint-Germain in Paris with Sartre and others. He also toured the United States to lecture about French thought. Although he leaned left, politically, his strong criticisms of Communist doctrine did not win him any friends in the Communist parties and eventually alienated Sartre. In 1949, his tuberculosis returned, whereupon he lived in seclusion for two years. In 1951, he published The Rebel, a philosophical analysis of rebellion and revolution which expressed his rejection of communism. Upsetting many of his colleagues and contemporaries in France, the book brought about the final split with Sartre. The dour reception depressed Camus; he began to translate plays. Camus's first significant contribution to philosophy was his idea of the absurd. He saw it as the result of our desire for clarity and meaning within a world and condition that offers neither, which he expressed in The Myth of Sisyphus and incorporated into many of his other works, such as The Stranger and The Plague. Despite his split from his \\"study partner\\", Sartre, Camus was still categorized as an Existentialist. He specifically rejected that label in his essay \\"Enigma\\" and elsewhere.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the project that will provide replacement terminals in the city with five metro lines? from the following article ?  The Istanbul Metro comprises five lines (the M1, M2, M3 and M6 on the European side, and the M4 on the Asian side) with several other lines (such as the M5, M7, and M8) and extensions under construction. The two sides of Istanbul's metro are connected under the Bosphorus by the Marmaray tunnel, inaugurated in 2013 as the first rail connection between Thrace and Anatolia. Until then, buses provide transportation within and between the two halves of the city, accommodating 2.2 million passenger trips each day. The Metrobus, a form of bus rapid transit, crosses the Bosphorus Bridge, with dedicated lanes leading to its termini. İDO (Istanbul Seabuses) runs a combination of all-passenger ferries and car-and-passenger ferries to ports on both sides of the Bosphorus, as far north as the Black Sea. With additional destinations around the Sea of Marmara, İDO runs the largest municipal ferry operation in the world. The city's main cruise ship terminal is the Port of Istanbul in Karaköy, with a capacity of 10,000 passengers per hour. Most visitors enter Istanbul by air, but about half a million foreign tourists enter the city by sea each year. International rail service from Istanbul launched in 1889, with a line between Bucharest and Istanbul's Sirkeci Terminal, which ultimately became famous as the eastern terminus of the Orient Express from Paris. Regular service to Bucharest and Thessaloniki continued until the early 2010s, when the former was interrupted for Marmaray construction and the latter was halted due to economic problems in Greece. After Istanbul's Haydarpaşa Terminal opened in 1908, it served as the western terminus of the Baghdad Railway and an extension of the Hejaz Railway; today, neither service is offered directly from Istanbul.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds.  - Hummingbirds are birds from the Americas that constitute the family Trochilidae. They are among the smallest of birds, most species measuring . Indeed, the smallest extant bird species is a hummingbird, the 5-cm bee hummingbird weighing less than a U.S. penny (2.5 g).  - Mitrospingus is a genus of bird formerly in the family Thraupidae . Established by Robert Ridgway in 1898 , it contains the following species : Dusky - faced tanager ( Mitrospingus cassinii ) Olive - backed tanager ( Mitrospingus oleagineus ) The name Mitrospingus is a combination of the Greek words mitra meaning \`\` cap '' or \`\` head - dress '' and spingos , meaning \`\` finch '' .  - The ostrich or common ostrich (\\"Struthio camelus\\") is either one or two species of large flightless birds native to Africa, the only living member(s) of the genus \\"Struthio\\", which is in the ratite family. In 2014, the Somali ostrich (\\"Struthio molybdophanes\\") was recognized as a distinct species.    What is the relationship between 'mitrospingus' and 'the americas'? Answer:","output":"There is no direct relationship between 'Mitrospingus' and 'the Americas.' Mitrospingus is a genus of birds, which includes species like the Dusky-faced Tanager (Mitrospingus cassinii) and Olive-backed Tanager (Mitrospingus oleagineus). These birds are not specifically related to 'the Americas,' as the term refers to a group of hummingbirds native to the Americas, which are distinct from the Mitrospingus genus. The relationship between Mitrospingus and the Americas can be understood through the broader context of the diverse bird species found in the regions of North, Central, and South America. Both hummingbirds and Mitrospingus belong to the avian species characteristic of the Americas, but they are different types of birds that belong to separate families and genera."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer:","output":"The origins of the police force in America can be traced back to the early 17th century, but the official formation of a structured force is more closely associated with the 19th century. It is essential to look at different periods and regions to understand the development of policing in the United States accurately. In the 1630s, the colonies in North America adopted a system known as \\"night watch,\\" which was primarily used in England. This system involved volunteers who were appointed to patrol the streets at night, focusing on maintaining order, watching out for criminals, and assisting in extinguishing fires. The night watch was a temporary, informal, and rather ineffective policing system that continued well into the 19th century. However, the first officially recognized and publicly funded police force was established in Boston in 1838, which is often considered the starting point of the American police system. The primary motivation for the creation of this force was to maintain civil order and control over an increasingly urbanized and industrious population. During this time, cities like New York, Albany, and Philadelphia also began establishing formal police departments. The New York City Police Department (NYPD), founded in 1845, is one of the oldest and largest police forces in the United States. It was modeled after London's Metropolitan Police and was predominantly created to address the growing concerns of crime and public disorder associated with rapid urbanization and immigration. In the mid to late 19th century, the concept of modern policing began to emerge, under the guidance and influence of leaders such as Sir Robert Peel in England. The key principles of this new approach to policing were to prevent crime, work closely with communities, and maintain strict standards of professionalism, ethical conduct, and impartial law enforcement. These principles deeply influenced the establishment and evolution of police departments in the United States. The establishment of the police force in America occurred at different times across various states and regions. The modernization and expansion of police forces took place primarily between the 1830s and the turn of the 20th century. The role of the police has continued to evolve over time, addressing contemporary social issues such as civil rights, community policing, and crime reduction strategies to further adapt to the needs of society."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: -  The trees and plants burn - The animals lose their homes - If the animals can not escape, they may die from smoke inhalation - The plants that provide food are gone - The animals have little to eat -   What might be the first step of the process?

The National Collegiate Athletic Association says the state will forfeit 133 applications for events if it is not repealed in two days, reports say. Under House Bill Two (HB2), transgender people must use toilets that correspond to the sex on their birth certificates. The bill also removed several anti-discrimination measures. North Carolina is under mounting pressure to repeal the bill, which has already led some businesses, entertainers and teams to boycott the state. The NBA moved its high-revenue 2017 All Star game from Charlotte and the NCAA itself moved seven games from the state during the current season. The state stands to lose up to 3.8bn (Â£3bn) over 12 years as a result of the boycott, AP news agency says. However state officials have failed to reach an agreement despite months of negotiations. On Tuesday Republicans in the US Congress and North Carolina's Democratic governor blamed each other for the continuing impasse.

Dozens of California cities looking to shore up revenues are flirting with a new idea — tax your “Gilmore Girls” binge. Pasadena was among the first to say publicly this fall that it wanted to tax video streaming services like Netflix, a step that could make up for lost tax revenue from growing numbers of cord-cutters. At 9.4 percent, the so-called Netflix tax would treat streaming services as a traditional utility, the city said. If you use multiple services — for example, Hulu, Amazon Video and HBO — it would be added to each bill. The move in Pasadena, with a population of about 140,000, has drawn consternation from technology companies and consumers who worry that it could be copied across the state. “Websites and apps are not utilities and it defies logic to tax them like electricity, water or gas,” said Noah Theran, spokesman for the Internet Association, a trade group. No California city has yet to begin collecting the tax. But roughly 40 cities, among them Glendale, Santa Barbara, Stockton and Sacramento, have gotten guidance from municipal consultants on how they might. Public officials have argued that taxation rules need to be revised to account for changing technologies. It is unfair, some say, that people who get video through cable television are taxed while those who have shifted over to internet streaming services are not. One question officials would need to resolve is where to stop, analysts say. If streaming video is taxable, then what about music, podcasts or video games? “It opens a big Pandora’s box,” said Paul Verna, an analyst at eMarketer, a technology research company. Mr. Verna said many of the streaming video tax proposals in California have bubbled up under the radar. If there is to be a larger debate, it will erupt when people start seeing their bills, he said. For now, the proposed tax is “under internal review,” William Boyer, a Pasadena city spokesman, said in an email. Tyron Hampton, a council member who has opposed the tax, said that with the city’s underfunded pensions, officials were right to be looking for novel ways to raise money. But the web should be off limits, he said: “The basic tenet of the internet is that the internet is supposed to be free.” • Officials in so-called sanctuary cities say they will act as a bulwark against mass deportations, even at the risk of losing federal money.

But another sort of rebellion occurred in Northern California long before Election Day. It was this week in 1941 that a group of miners halted traffic along Route 99 in Siskiyou County and handed out proclamations to motorists declaring the formation of Jefferson, a new state named after the author of the Declaration of Independence. With Yreka as its capital, Jefferson would include parts of both Oregon and California where resentments had simmered over the supposed neglect of politicians in the capitals of Salem and Sacramento. The journalist Lawrence E. Davies described the scene in the Nov. 28 edition of The New York Times: “Bonfires blazed along the main north-south highway winding through the towering Siskiyous tonight as determined mining men, with pistols in their belts, stopped motorists and distributed yellow handbills proclaiming ‘independence’ of a group of Oregon and California counties.” The agitators complained that the region was deprived of proper roads needed to transport their copper ore and timber. They vowed to barricade the highway every Thursday until their demands were met. But the uprising was to be short-lived. Gilbert Gable, the mayor of Port Orford, Ore., who had initiated the Jefferson movement and led its public relations effort, died on Dec. 2. Five days after that, Pearl Harbor was attacked. And the mood for rebellion was eclipsed by the war effort. Now, more than seven decades later, the movement for a state of Jefferson remains a hot issue in Northern California. In 2013, the Siskiyou County board of supervisors approved a declaration that called for breaking away from the state. The complaints echo those of the miners in the 1940s: chiefly, a perceived lack of representation in Sacramento. California Today goes live at 6 a.m. Pacific time weekdays.

Information:  - Archosaurs are a group of diapsid amniotes whose living representatives consist of birds and crocodilians. This group also includes all extinct non-avian dinosaurs, extinct crocodilian relatives, and pterosaurs. Archosauria, the archosaur clade, is a crown group that includes the most recent common ancestor of living birds and crocodilians. It includes two main clades: Pseudosuchia, which includes crocodilians and their extinct relatives, and Ornithosuchia, which includes birds and their extinct relatives (such as non-avian dinosaurs and pterosaurs).  - Desmatosuchinae is one of the two subfamilies of aetosaurs, the other being Aetosaurinae. It is a stem-based taxon defined as all aetosaurs more closely related to \\"Desmatosuchus\\" than the last common ancestor of \\"Desmatosuchus\\" and \\"Stagonolepis\\". All synapomorphies that diagnose the clade can be found in the osteoderms. These include tongue-and-groove articulations for lateral plates present in dorsal presacral paramedian plates and large spikes on the lateral cervical, dorsal, and caudal plates.  - Aetosaurinae is one of the two subfamilies of aetosaurs , the other being Desmatosuchinae . It is a stem - based taxon defined as all aetosaurs more closely related to Aetosaurus than to the last common ancestor of Aetosaurus and Desmatosuchus . The only synapomorphy that diagnoses the clade Aetosaurinae is the medial offset of the dorsal eminences of the paramedian osteoderms . A phylogenetic study in 2012 found Aetosaurinae to be paraphyletic , with Aetosaurus being the basal-most stagonolepidid and aetosaurines like Calyptosuchus , Neoaetosauroides , and the newly described Aetobarbakinoides being successively more derived taxa leading up to a clade containing Desmatosuchinae and Typothoracisinae . Under this phylogeny , most traditional aetosaurines are more closely related to Desmatosuchus than they are to Aetosaurus , and the clade Aetosaurinae can only include Aetosaurus .  - South Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost country in Africa. It is bounded on the south by of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, on the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, and on the east and northeast by Mozambique and Swaziland, and surrounding the kingdom of Lesotho. South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world by land area, and with close to 56 million people, is the world's 24th-most populous nation. It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere. It is the only country that borders both the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean. About 80 percent of South Africans are of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different Bantu languages, nine of which have official status. The remaining population consists of Africa's largest communities of European (white), Asian (Indian), and multiracial (coloured) ancestry.  - Desmatosuchus (from Greek  \\"desmos\\" 'link' +  \\"soûkhos\\" 'crocodile') is an extinct genus of archosaur belonging to the Order Aetosauria. It lived during the Late Triassic.  - Neoaetosauroides is an extinct genus of primitive aetosaur. Its type and only species is \\"N. engaeus\\". Fossils have been found from the Los Colorados Formation outcropping along the Sierra Morada River in La Rioja, Argentina, and date back to the Norian age of the Late Triassic. It was the first aetosaur known from the formation, with remains being discovered in the 1960s.  - In biology, phylogenetics (Greek: ,  - \\"phylé\\", \\"phylon\\" = tribe, clan, race +  - \\"genetikós\\" = origin, source, birth) is the study of the evolutionary history and relationships among individuals or groups of organisms (e.g. species, or populations). These relationships are discovered through phylogenetic inference methods that evaluate observed heritable traits, such as DNA sequences or morphology under a model of evolution of these traits. The result of these analyses is a phylogeny (also known as a phylogenetic tree)  a diagrammatic hypothesis about the history of the evolutionary relationships of a group of organisms. The tips of a phylogenetic tree can be living organisms or fossils, and represent the \\"end,\\" or the present, in an evolutionary lineage. Phylogenetic analyses have become central to understanding biodiversity, evolution, ecology, and genomes.  - Aetosaurus is an extinct genus of archosaur reptile belonging to the order Aetosauria. It is generally considered to be the most primitive aetosaur. Three species are currently recognized: \\"A. ferratus\\", the type species from Germany and Italy; \\"A. crassicauda\\" from Germany; and \\"A. arcuatus\\" from eastern North America. Additional specimens referred to \\"Aetosaurus\\" have been found from South Africa, the Chinle Group of the southwestern United States, and the Fleming Fjord Formation of Greenland. Specimens of \\"Aetosaurus\\" occur in Norian-age strata.  - Plants are mainly multicellular, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae.  - The Late Triassic is the third and final of three epochs of the Triassic Period in the geologic timescale. The Triassic-Jurassic extinction event began during this epoch and is one of the five major mass extinction events of the Earth. The corresponding series is known as the Upper Triassic. In Europe the epoch was called the Keuper, after a German lithostratigraphic group (a sequence of rock strata) that has a roughly corresponding age. The Late Triassic spans the time between Ma and Ma (million years ago). The Late Triassic is divided into the Carnian, Norian and Rhaetian ages.  - Typothoracisinae is a clade of aetosaurs within the subfamily Aetosaurinae. It is a stem-based taxon defined as all aetosaurs closer to \\"Typothorax\\" than to \\"Stagonolepis\\" or \\"Desmatosuchus\\". As with many aetosaur taxa, most of the synapomorphies that diagnose the clade are found in the osteoderms. These include a strongly acute angle of flexion between the dorsal and lateral flanges of the dorsal and lateral plates and triangular-shaped pelvic and anterior caudal dorsal lateral plates possessing semicircular borders and hook-like eminences.  - The Triassic is a geologic period and system which spans 50.9 million years from the end of the Permian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Jurassic Period Mya. The Triassic is the first period of the Mesozoic Era. Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events. The Triassic was named in 1834 by Friedrich von Alberti, after the three distinct rock layers (\\"tri\\" meaning \\"three\\") that are found throughout Germany and northwestern Europered beds, capped by marine limestone, followed by a series of terrestrial mud- and sandstonescalled the \\"Trias\\".  - Emil Hans Willi Hennig (April 20, 1913  November 5, 1976) was a German biologist who is considered the founder of phylogenetic systematics, also known as cladistics. In 1945 as a prisoner of war, Hennig began work on his theory of cladistics, which he published in 1950. With his works on evolution and systematics he revolutionised the view of the natural order of beings. As a taxonomist, he specialised in dipterans (ordinary flies and mosquitoes).  - Reptiles are tetrapod (four-limbed vertebrate) animals in the class Reptilia, comprising today's turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their extinct relatives. The study of these traditional reptile orders, historically combined with that of modern amphibians, is called herpetology.  - In biology and genealogy, the most recent common ancestor (MRCA, also \\"last common ancestor\\" LCA, or \\"concestor\\") of any set of organisms is the most recent individual from which all organisms in a group, for are directly descended. The term is also used reference to the ancestry of groups of genes (haplotypes) rather than organisms.  - In biological classification, a subfamily (Latin: ', plural ') is an auxiliary (intermediate) taxonomic rank, next below family but more inclusive than genus. Standard nomenclature rules end subfamily botanical names with \\"-oideae\\", and zoological names with \\"-inae\\".  - In phylogenetics, apomorphy and synapomorphy refer to derived characteristic of a clade. Apomorphy implies a characteristic that is different from the form of an ancestor, i.e., an innovation, of use in determining membership in a clade. Synapomorphy is a shared derived character or trait state that distinguishes a clade from other organisms. In other words, it is an apomorphy shared by members of a monophyletic group, and thus assumed to be present in their most recent common ancestor. The word synapomorphy, coined by German entomologist Willi Hennig, is derived from the Greek words ', \\"syn\\" = shared; ', \\"apo\\" = away from; and \\"\\", \\"morphe\\" = shape.A   - In zoological nomenclature, a type species (\\"species typica\\") is the species name with which the name of a genus or subgenus is considered to be permanently taxonomically associated, i.e., the species that contains the biological type specimen(s). A similar concept is used for suprageneric groups called a type genus.  - Calyptosuchus (meaning \\"covered crocodile\\") is an extinct genus of crurotarsan from the Late Triassic of North America. As an aetosaur, it was heavily armored and had a pig-like snout used to uproot plants. The genus might be a junior synonym of \\"Stagonolepis\\".  - A pig is any of the animals in the genus Sus, within the Suidae family of even-toed ungulates. Pigs include the domestic pig and its ancestor, the common Eurasian wild boar (\\"Sus scrofa\\"), along with other species; related creatures outside the genus include the peccary, the babirusa, and the warthog. Pigs, like all suids, are native to the Eurasian and African continents. Juvenile pigs are known as piglets. Pigs are highly social and intelligent animals.  - Typothorax is an extinct genus of typothoracisine aetosaur that lived in the Late Triassic. Its remains have been found in North America. Two species are known: \\"T. coccinarum\\", the type species, and \\"T. antiquum\\".  - Stagonolepis is an extinct genus of stagonolepidid aetosaur known from the Late Triassic (Carnian stage) of Europe.  - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies.  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.  - A clade (from , \\"klados\\", \\"branch\\") is a group of organisms that consists of a common ancestor and all its lineal descendants, and represents a single \\"branch\\" on the \\"tree of life\\".  - Aetosaurs (\\"aetosaur\\" ; order name \\"Aetosauria\\" ; from Greek, (aetos, \\"eagle\\") and (sauros, \\"lizard\\")) are an extinct order of heavily armoured, medium- to large-sized Late Triassic herbivorous archosaurs. They have small heads, upturned snouts, erect limbs, and a body covered by plate-like scutes. All aetosaurs belong to the family Stagonolepididae. Two distinct subdivisions of aetosaurs are currently recognized, Desmatosuchinae and Aetosaurinae, based primarily on differences in the morphology of the bony scutes of the two groups. Over 20 genera of aetosaurs have been described, and recently there has been controversy regarding the description of some of these genera.    After reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'aetosaurinae' with the relationship of 'taxon rank'.  Choices: - branch  - class  - family  - form  - genus  - group  - kingdom  - order  - series  - species  - subfamily  - subgenus  - tribe  - variety The answer to this question is:","output":"- subfamily  Aetosaurinae is one of the two subfamilies of aetosaurs, the other being Desmatosuchinae. A subfamily is an auxiliary (intermediate) taxonomic rank, next below family but more inclusive than genus."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Brock Edward Lesnar was born on July 12, 1977 in Webster, South Dakota, the son of Stephanie and Richard Lesnar, and grew up on his parents' dairy farm in Webster. He is of German descent. He has two older brothers, Troy and Chad, and a younger sister, Brandi. At age 17, Lesnar joined the Army National Guard, where he was assigned to an office job after his red-green colorblindness was deemed hazardous to his desire to work with explosives. Lesnar's next defense was against undefeated top contender Cain Velasquez on October 23 at the Honda Center in Anaheim, California at UFC 121. Dana White announced via SportsNation that the UFC would bring back UFC Primetime to hype the fight. Lesnar was defeated by Velasquez for the title by TKO in the first round.  On January 11, 2011, Lesnar was announced as a coach of The Ultimate Fighter Season 13, opposite Junior dos Santos, with the two expected to fight on June 11 at UFC 131, but he was struck with another bout of diverticulitis and had to withdraw from the fight on May 12. He was replaced by Shane Carwin, who ended up losing against dos Santos. Lesnar underwent surgery on May 27 to help battle his problems with diverticulitis. Dana White said that he had a 12-inch piece of his colon removed.  In its May 2011 issue, ESPN's magazine published a story listing the highest paid athlete based on base salary and earnings for the most recent calendar year or most recent season in 30 sports. Lesnar topped the list for MMA at 5.3 million, which included his reported bout salaries and estimated pay-per-view bonuses.  In the summer of 2011, Lesnar announced that he was returning to action, stating, \\"I feel like a new man. Healthy. Strong. I feel like I used to feel\\". His return match was scheduled to be at UFC 141 on December 30 in Las Vegas against former Strikeforce heavyweight champion Alistair Overeem. Overeem won the fight by way of technical knockout in the first round. The result of the fight remains controversial, as Overeem tested positive for elevated levels of testosterone prior to his next fight. Lesnar then announced his retirement from MMA, mentioning his struggles with diverticulitis and saying \\"tonight was the last time you'll see me in the octagon\\".  Speculation about a return to MMA lasted until March 24, 2015, when Lesnar announced in an interview on SportsCenter that he had re-signed with WWE and officially closed the door on a return to MMA, even though he was offered a deal \\"ten times more\\" than what he had made previously in his MMA career. He further elaborated that, while he was training for months for a return to the UFC, he felt \\"physically great but something was lacking mentally\\". Lesnar added that \\"[he's] an older caveman now, so [he] makes smarter caveman decisions\\" and that he chose to sign with WWE instead of returning to MMA because he could \\"work part-time with full-time pay\\". When did he retire?","output":"Brock Lesnar announced his retirement from MMA after his fight with Alistair Overeem at UFC 141 on December 30. The retirement was mentioned in the following line from the article: \\"Lesnar then announced his retirement from MMA, mentioning his struggles with diverticulitis and saying 'tonight was the last time you'll see me in the octagon'.\\" First, I determined the task was a follow-up question about the text.

Summarize this article: Tokyo (CNN) Authorities have discovered the bodies of six people, including a 7-year-old girl, at a house in the Japanese town of Takachiho, a popular destination for tourists visiting the Takachiho Gorge in southwestern Miyazaki province.      Police found the remains at a house owned by 72-year-old Yasuo Iihoshi after a family member had reported that his calls had gone unanswered, according to Miyazaki prefectural police.      One of the bodies, a female, was discovered outside the property, while three males and two more females were found inside the house.      Japan, which ranks as one of the safest countries in the world to live, has a very low murder rate and mass killings are rare. Given Japan's strict gun laws, in the infrequent attacks that do occur, knives are more commonly used.      In the Takachiho killings, at least some of the victims had been stabbed, local media reported. The murder weapon has not been recovered.

Police said they later discovered the body of a seventh person who had jumped or fallen from a nearby bridge into a river in Takachiho, Miyazaki prefecture, a mountain village of 12,000 people and a popular tourist destination.      Investigators discovered the body of a woman outside the house and the bodies of five other people, including a young girl, inside, on Monday. Media reports said some of the victims appeared to have been stabbed.      Police named three of them as Mihoko Iihoshi, the 66-year-old wife of the house’s owner, 72-year-old farmer Yasuo Iihoshi, their seven-year-old granddaughter Yui and a male acquaintance, 44-year-old Fumiaki Matsuoka.      The bodies of the remaining three victims – two men and a woman – were yet to be publicly identified.      Police went to the house after a relative told them his calls to the family had gone unanswered, according to Kyodo news.      The seventh body, whom police believe could be that of Yasuo Iihoshi’s son, was found in a river about three kilometres away. It appeared he had driven to the bridge in the family car.      The area is near Takachiho valley, a popular tourist destination known for its scenic gorge and connections to Japan’s indigenous religion Shinto.      The discovery sparked fear among residents, with local officials urging people to exercise caution and collect their children from school, Kyodo said.      Mass killings are a rarity in Japan, which is considered one of the safest countries in the world, thanks in part to its strict gun laws. However, killings carried out with knives occasionally make headlines.      In 2001 a man with a history of mental illness forced his way into a primary school in Osaka and fatally stabbed eight children aged between six and eight. In 2008 seven people were killed when a man slammed a truck into a crowd on a busy shopping street in central Tokyo and then launched a frenzied knife attack. In July 2016 Satoshi Uematsu, who claimed he wanted to make people with disabilities “disappear”, killed 19 people and injured 27 others in a knife attack at a care facility in Sagamihara, south of Tokyo. ||||| TAKACHIHO, Miyazaki Prefecture--Police are investigating the deaths of seven people here as a possible murder-suicide after a body was retrieved from a river near the Takachiho-kyo gorge sightseeing spot on Nov. 27.      The body was identified as Masahiro Iihoshi, 42, whose car was discovered near a bridge in the town. Police suspect he committed suicide by jumping into the Gokasegawa river.      The six people, found dead on Nov. 26, were all stabbed, according to investigative sources.      Five of the bodies in the house were identified as members of the Iihoshi family: Yasuo, 72, his wife, Mihoko, 66, Masahiro’s wife, Mikiko, 41, their 21-year-old son, Takumi, and his 7-year-old daughter, Yui.      Masahiro is the second son of Yasuo and Mihoko.      The other body in the house was identified as Fumiaki Matsuoka, 44, a friend of Masahiro who lives in Gokase in the same prefecture.      Matsuoka was visiting the Iihoshi family to help resolve domestic problems involving Masahiro, according to investigative sources.      Around 10:20 a.m. on Nov. 26, relatives living outside the town alerted police after they were unable to contact the family members by phone.      When police arrived around 11 a.m., they found the body of an older woman, likely Mihoko, outside the house. The five other bodies were discovered inside the house.      At 4 p.m., they found the seventh body in the river just under the bridge, the sources said. |||||","output":"In a town called Takachiho in Japan, the police found the bodies of six people, including a little 7-year-old girl, in a house.

As she walks down the stairs she slips, and her journal falls into the hands of a handsome fighter pilot, Bear. He states how beautiful her smile is. They are soon on a date in which they both realize they are in love with each other. As he flies through the air Bear sings about how madly in love he is.

SHORT TITLE.     This Act may be cited as the \`\`Tobacco Regulatory Fairness Act of  2000''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS.     Congress makes the following findings:             (1) Cigarette smoking and tobacco use cause approximately          450,000 deaths each year in the United States.             (2) Cigarette smoking accounts for approximately          65,000,000,000 in lost productivity and health care costs.             (3) In spite of the well-established dangers of cigarette          smoking and tobacco use, there is no Federal agency that has          any authority to regulate the manufacture, sale, distribution,          and use of tobacco products.             (4) The tobacco industry spends approximately          4,000,000,000 each year to promote tobacco products.             (5) Each day 3,000 children try cigarettes for the first          time, many of whom become lifelong addicted smokers.             (6) There is no minimum age requirement in Federal law that          an individual must reach to legally buy cigarettes and other          tobacco products.             (7) The Food and Drug Administration is the most qualified          Federal agency to regulate tobacco products.             (8) It is inconsistent for the Food and Drug Administration          to regulate the manufacture, sale, and distribution of other          nicotine-containing products used as substitutes for cigarette          smoking and tobacco use and not be able to regulate tobacco          products in a comparable manner. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.     Section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C.  321) is amended by adding at the end the following:     \`\`(kk) The term \`tobacco product' means cigarettes, cigars, little  cigars, pipe tobacco, smokeless tobacco, snuff, and chewing tobacco.     \`\`(ll) The term \`tobacco additive' means any substance the intended  use of which results or may reasonably be expected to result, directly  or indirectly, in its becoming a component or otherwise affecting the  characteristics of any tobacco product.     \`\`(mm) The term \`constituent' means any element of cigarette  mainstream or sidestream smoke which is present in quantities which  represent a potential health hazard or where the health effect is  unknown.     \`\`(nn) The term \`tar' means mainstream total articulate matter  minus nicotine and water.''. SEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT.     Section 301 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C.  331) is amended--             (1) in subsections (a), (b), (c), (g), and (k), by striking          \`\`or cosmetic'' and inserting \`\`cosmetic, or tobacco product'';          and             (2) by adding at the end the following:     \`\`(u) The manufacture, sale, distribution, and advertising of  tobacco products in violation of regulations promulgated by the  Secretary pursuant to chapter X.''. SEC. 5. REGULATION OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS.

Texas Rural Legal Aid - known for its fearless and sometimes controversial advocacy of the poorest of the poor - last week took over four other corporations serving the legal needs of the indigent in Southwest Texas, including the one in Bexar County. The new 68-county legal aid organization has yet to be named and stretches from El Paso to Corpus Christi, Harlingen to Austin. The leader for the super-sized law firm has big plans. \\"I'm more interested in looking at what we as advocates can do to address the serious problems of poverty than the number of cases we close,\\" said David Hall, the TRLA executive director. In the Rio Grande Valley, Hall's attorneys set up separate groups to assist small-business owners and residents with low-interest loans and legal representation. They also operate a legal arm that assists migrant workers from Texas to Kentucky. Now, Hall said, he wants to make services to the poor more efficient by working with law students who will handle less complicated legal matters, allowing licensed attorneys to take more \\"high impact\\" cases to court. \\"What we need to do is handle cases as efficiently as we can, leveraging the amount of time of the lawyer that goes in there and maximizing the number of people that they can help at one time,\\" Hall said. His plan is to place the 110 attorneys on staff in teams working on specialized legal issues. He wants to expand the law clinic it already has with St. Mary's University Law School to involve students at the University of Texas Law School. The law students at St. Mary's interview potential clients, assist them with filling out legal documents and answer the telephones for the legal hotline, freeing up TRLA lawyers to handle the complicated cases, Hall said. By the end of September, Hall said all the attorneys working with the poor in the 68county area will be placed on the same computer network so they can pass cases to the best available attorneys. Last year, board members on the former Legal Aid of Central Texas and Bexar County Legal Aid resisted the merger, saying that the mergers were done illegally and without the input of board members. They also argued that Hall's litigious style hampered their ability to garner funds from Congress. TRLA generated controversy in 1996, when its attorneys challenged the rights of 800 military personnel to vote in Val Verde County elections by absentee ballot after a former Ku Klux Klan member won a county commissioner post. Brendan Gill, the former executive director of the Bexar County group, said he has since come to see the merger as a positive move for South Texas. \\"I always knew there were good points to merging, just as I knew that there were bad points,\\" Gill said.

Carol Anne awakens one night and begins conversing with the family's television set, which is transmitting static following a sign-off. The following night, while the Freelings sleep, Carol Anne fixates on the television set as it transmits static again. Suddenly, a hand of a white apparition blasts from the television screen and vanishes into the wall, triggering a violent earthquake in the process. As the shaking subsides, Carol Anne announces \\"They're here\\". Bizarre events occur the following day: a drinking glass of milk spontaneously breaks, silverware bends and furniture moves on its own accord. The phenomena seem benign at first, but quickly begin to intensify. That night, a gnarled backyard tree comes alive and grabs Robbie through the bedroom window. While Steven rescues Robbie before the tree swallows him, Carol Anne is sucked through a portal in her closet. The Freelings realize she has been taken when they hear her voice emanating from a television set that is tuned to an empty channel. A group of parapsychologists from UC Irvine â Dr. Lesh (Beatrice Straight), Ryan (Richard Lawson), and Marty (Martin Casella) â come to the Freeling house to investigate and determine that the Freelings are experiencing a poltergeist intrusion.

Comically treated with a cold steak, if someone is sporting a \\"shiner,\\" what do they typically have?","output":"When someone is said to be sporting a \\"shiner,\\" they typically have a black eye, which is a common term for a bruise or hematoma around the eye socket. A black eye may occur due to blunt-force trauma to the area, such as getting accidentally hit in the face, participating in contact sports, or being in a physical altercation. Black eyes are not only characterized by the dark discoloration around the eye, but they can also be accompanied by redness, swelling, and tenderness. The discoloration is a result of bleeding beneath the skin that is triggered by a rupture of blood vessels surrounding the eye. When the blood from these vessels accumulates in the tissues, it can produce a range of colors such as red, blue, purple, and eventually dark green or yellow, as the body works to break it down and absorb it. The comical aspect of treating a black eye with a cold steak has appeared in movies and television shows as a form of home remedy. The purpose behind using a cold steak originates from the benefits of applying cold temperatures to the affected area. When cold is applied to an injury or swelling, it helps in constricting blood vessels, reducing ongoing bleeding beneath the skin, and minimizing inflammation. Cold therapy can temporarily alleviate pain and discomfort by numbing the area as well. While using a cold steak for treating a black eye might be a popular and amusing concept, it's not the most efficient or sanitary method, as a raw steak could introduce bacteria into the area around the eye, which might lead to infection.  Instead, it is recommended to use more sterile and practical methods to treat a black eye, such as: 1. Applying a cold pack: Wrap a bag of ice or a bag of frozen peas in a thin towel and gently place it on the affected area for 15-20 minutes several times a day. It is important to avoid applying the ice directly on the skin to prevent frostbite. 2. Keeping the head elevated: Elevating the head, especially while sleeping, helps reduce the accumulation of fluid in the injured area and minimizes swelling. 3. Taking over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medication: Medications like ibuprofen can help alleviate pain and reduce inflammation. However, it is crucial to consult a doctor or pharmacist before taking any medication. 4. Avoiding hot compresses: In the first few days after the injury, it’s essential to avoid warm or hot compresses, as heat may increase the swelling. It is important to monitor the symptoms of a black eye, and if they worsen or do not get better within a few days, one should seek medical attention. Furthermore, any vision disturbances, dizziness, or severe pain associated with the injury should prompt immediate consultation with a healthcare professional."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Ukraine official: Russia has launched 'armed invasion' in Crimea Russian troops moved into Crimea Friday, U.S. officials told Fox News, prompting Ukraine to accuse Russia of an \\"armed invasion.\\" At the White House, President Obama said the U.S. government is \\"deeply concerned\\" by reports of Russian \\"military movements\\" and warned any violation of Ukraine's sovereignty would be \\"deeply destabilizing.\\" \\"There will be costs\\" for any military intervention, he said, without specifying what those costs might be. U.S. officials told Fox News they see “evidence of air and maritime movement into and out of Crimea by Russian forces” although the Pentagon declined to officially \\"characterize\\" the movement. Agence France Press quoted a top Ukranian official as saying Russian aircraft carrying nearly 2,000 suspected troops have landed at a military air base near the regional capital of the restive Crimean peninsula. \\"Thirteen Russian aircraft landed at the airport of Gvardeyskoye (near Simferopol) with 150 people in each one,\\" Sergiy Kunitsyn, the Ukrainian president's special representative in Crimea, told the local ATR television channel, according to AFP. He accused Russia of an \\"armed invasion.\\" The new developments prompted Ukraine to accuse Russia of a \\"military invasion and occupation\\" -- a claim that brought an alarming new dimension to the crisis. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, issued a statement late Friday saying, \\"It appears that the Russian military now controls the Crimean peninsula. This aggression is a threat not only to Ukraine, but to regional peace and stability. Russia’s latest action is yet another indicator that Vladimir Putin’s hegemonic ambitions threaten U.S. interests and allies around the world.\\" Russia kept silent on claims of military intervention, even as it maintained its hard-line stance on protecting ethnic Russians in Crimea, a peninsula of Ukraine on the northern coast of the Black Sea. A spokesman for the Ukrainian border service said eight Russian transport planes have landed in Crimea with unknown cargo. Serhiy Astakhov told The Associated Press that the Il-76 planes arrived unexpectedly Friday and were given permission to land, one after the other, at Gvardeiskoye air base, north of the regional capital, Simferopol. Astakhov said the people in the planes refused to identify themselves and waved off customs officials, saying they didn't require their services. Earlier in the day, Russian armored vehicles rumbled across Crimea and reports surfaced of troops being deployed at airports and a coast guard base – signs of a more heavy-handed approach to the crisis from Moscow. Ukraine's U.N. ambassador Yuriy Sergeyev told the U.N. Security Council that Russian military helicopters and transport planes are entering his country, that neither major airport in Ukraine is under national control and that the main airport was \\"captured by Russian armed forces.\\" He claimed 11 Russian military helicopters had been brought in along with M-24 military transport planes. Armed gunmen took control of the two main airports in Crimea Friday. However, Russia has so far been silent on the claims of military involvement. No violence was reported at the civilian airport in Crimea's capital of Simferopol or at the military airport in the Black Sea port of Sevastopol, also part of Crimea. At the Simferopol airport, a man claiming to speak for the camouflage-clad forces patrolling the airport described them as Crimean militiamen. Meanwhile, ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych surfaced in Russia Friday, thundering defiantly against the “pro-fascist hooligans” who drove him from office. Yanukovych warned of the dangers of “irresponsible Western policy” as he vowed to continue the fight for Ukraine’s future Friday at a press conference in Rostov-on-don, Russia—his first public appearance since last Saturday. \\"I intend to keep fighting for the future of Ukraine against those who are using fear and terror to seize the country,\\" he told reporters. The fugitive leader said he was forced to leave Ukraine due to threats, Reuters reported. He blamed the country’s crisis on “irresponsible Western policy,” and said he trusted the \\"decency of Western mediators” when he signed a peace deal last week brokered by members of the European Union. But recent actions by the opposition run counter to the agreement, he said. Yanukovych said he does not plan to ask Russia for military support in dealing with the crisis in Ukraine, where he said power was stolen by \`\`a bunch of radicals.” \\"Fascist hooligans\\" have taken power in Ukraine, Yanukovych told reporters, according to the BBC.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Jimbob Blakey wasn't so much given birth to as clambered right out of his mother himself. He weighed in at almost thirteen pounds, came ready-fitted with a shock of fat black hair and a couple of razor teeth. Jimbob's folks loved him like most folks love their little ones, maybe more. They'd been trying so hard for a child, suffered more mid-term miscarriages than the ewes they shuttled off to market most Thursdays. They dressed him in a one-year babygro and took him home to their hill farm. They fought to get up nights and give him his milk. His teeth made breast-feeding impossible. They sat hours gazing down in his cot. They dressed him fine and took him to their church and gave their thanks. Showed him off like the proud parents they were. Others cooed and smiled. But they never asked to hold. They gave thanks the Blakeys were happy, and that the monkey-baby had not been born to them. Jimbob's folks never gave a second thought that their boy might be different. The first Spring he walked, he stomped the moors in his welly-boots helping herd the pregnant ewes down in-by. He copied his father, kicking and cuffing at the stragglers, when the flock was returned to the hills in May. As Jimbob grew, his hair became thicker, his arms longer. His head shrunk down on his shoulders. At check-ups, nurses fixed smiles and pronounced him healthy. Doctors said, 'he'll make you a strapping lad.' His mother smiled, her heart swelled. When he was three, she sent him to nursery. She wanted him to mix with other kids. To taste life off the hard hills. She said, 'it'll do him the world of good.' Jimbob hated leaving the farm. He clung to his mother. She drove away, blinking tears. On the third day, she took a phone call. 'It's Jimbob,' they said. 'He's scaring the other kids.'The truth hit Jimbob's mother like a hammer.

Summarize: Make sure you are watching a scary movie with other people close by you. Invite more friends, family, or even pets if you’re watching the movie at home.  Talk to friends about the movie and whether or not they think they’ll get scared. It can help to know that most people get scared by horror movies, whether they admit it or not, because that’s the purpose of scary movies! If you’re watching in a movie theater, make sure you have people you know on either side of you, if possible, without empty seats, strangers, or an aisle next to you which could make you feel less comfortable. You can even ask a friend if they’re okay with you squeezing their hand or getting closer to them during scary parts. Most people are happy to help you feel at ease! Watch it with your girl/boyfriend; scary movies are often something that people bond over. See a movie in a room with the lights on, if possible. Get comfortable on a couch, chair, or the floor so you feel more safe.   Avoid watching the movie while it’s dark outside, or when you have to go to sleep directly afterwards. Watch a DVD during the day, or catch a matinee at a theater. Sit in a place next to the wall. You don't want to feel like something is behind you. You can even encourage watching a movie in a room of the house where other things are going on around you. This might help to distract you and remind you of reality during the movie. Wear a comfortable hoodie sweatshirt or other item of clothing that makes you feel warm and secure. Wrap yourself in a blanket if you want, or hug a pillow to your chest.  Wear a hoodie to a movie theater as a way to stay warm in the typically cold space, stay comfortable, and even hide your face with the hood if you want to. Share a blanket with a friend to help you feel close to someone and be extra warm. Warmth and comfort will help the shivers or vulnerable feeling you get when you’re scared. Get familiar with the movie you’re watching before you see it in the theater or in someone’s home. Knowing more about what will happen in the plot will help you be less surprised by the scary parts.  Watch a trailer, and any other available scenes from the movie you can find online. You will already be prepared for the scary visuals that they often show in the trailers if you watch them beforehand. You can even listen to the soundtrack beforehand if it’s available online. Do a happy, simple activity during the day while you listen to it and it won’t seem threatening. The soundtrack often makes scary parts of the movie much scarier, but not if you take the fear out of the music ahead of time. If you’ve already seen the movie, you can still refresh your memory by reading or watching content related to it, or just know that you will likely be less scared by something you’ve already seen.","output":"To comfortably watch a scary movie, ensure you have company, such as friends, family or pets. Preferably watch during the day in a well-lit room, surrounded by familiar people. Sit close to a wall and wear comfortable, warm clothing like a hoodie or wrap yourself in a blanket.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Process:  - The human body takes a breath inward - Air is transported to the lungs - Air reaches the alveoli, the smallest air sacs in the lungs - In the alveoli, air passes into the blood within small capillaries - The gaseous oxygen in the air dissolves into the capillary blood - The dissolved oxygen is picked-up by red blood cells - The red blood cells bind the oxygen via a protein called heme - Red blood cells circulate throughout the body and reach the various tissues - Within small capillaries, the heme release the oxygen - The oxygen can then reach the cells within the tissue -   suppose more energy absorbed happens, how will it affect less air reaches the alveoli.  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"The supposed perturbation of more energy being absorbed, resulting in less air reaching the alveoli, would be indirectly impacting a step of the process. Here's the reasoning: The process of oxygen transport in the human body involves various steps, as mentioned in the question. None of these steps specifically address energy absorption. However, if more energy is absorbed, it could potentially affect various physiological factors and lead to less air reaching the alveoli.  For example, increased energy absorption could cause the body to generate more heat, leading to a higher body temperature. This could potentially impact the respiratory rate or efficiency, indirectly causing less air to reach the alveoli. Additionally, any obstruction or changes in the airway, bronchioles, or lung function due to the increased energy absorption can also indirectly impact the air reaching the alveoli. In summary, the supposed perturbation of more energy absorption, causing less air to reach the alveoli, would be indirectly impacting a step of the process, as it potentially influences other physiological factors that could then affect the oxygen transport process."},{"instruction":"Information:  - The New York City Subway is a rapid transit system owned by the City of New York and leased to the New York City Transit Authority, a subsidiary agency of the state-run Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA).

Short answers containing words that are present in the passage are preferred. Luca Di Angelo (Fabio Testi) is a smuggler, one member of an organized team trafficking cigarettes and booze up and down the coast off Naples, Italy. After a run-in with the police in which the smugglers manage to get away by faking a boat explosion resulting in the police motorboats responding to the false emergency allowing the smugglers to get away, Luca and his brother Mickey suspect Scherino (Ferdinand Murolo), the head of a rival gang of smugglers, of passing on their actives. Lucia and Mickey take their accusations to their boss Perlante (Saverio Marconi) a sleazy playboy withy numerous Mafia connections, who agrees to look into it. After a nighttime fire at Mickey's racing stables kills a valued racehorse, he and Luca drive over to inspect the damage. But on the way, they are stopped at a fake police roadblock where the assassins dressed as policemen trick Mickey into getting out of the car and machine-gun him to death over and over again (a homage to Sonny Corelone's death scene in The Godfather), while Luca barely escapes injury by hiding on the floor of the car.Afterwards, Perlante suggests that Luca leave town for a few days, but he refuses. After his brother's funeral, conducted on the gang's speedboats in the Bay of Naples, with the police surveying them, Luca vows revenge. Despite his wife Adele's (Ivana Monti) pleas, Luca goes after the prime suspect: Scherino. That night, Luca breaks into Scherino's house, but gets spotted and severely beaten up by Scherino's henchmen. However, Scherino spares Luca's life. He tells Luca that he had no part in Mickey's killing.After Luca recovers from his injuries thanks to a local doctor named Charlie (Giordano Falzoni) who treats injuries for large bribes of cash, Luca meets with an informant who gives him a tip to who ordered the hit on Mickey. Traveling to a derelict fishing boat in the marina where a hood is making a drug pick-up, Luca tortures him for information about his boss, whom Luca learns is a Frenchman called Francois Jacios, aka: The Marsigliese. Luca calls Perlante, who tells him more about the vicious gangster, and who is muscling into Italian organized crime to deal in hard drugs. At his hideout in Naples, the Marsigliese (Marcel Bozzufi) is meeting Ingrid, a German drug courier from Frankfurt wanting to sell him some heroin. When the Marsigliese sees that the heroin is 'cut', he has her face horribly burned by a blowtorch while he watches with sadistic satisfaction.Over the course of one day, the Marsigliese orders a series of shootings of all the rival Mafia Dons all over Naples as part of his plan to become the sole kingpin of Naples. Perlante barely escapes an attempt on his life when his right-hand man Alfredo (Giulio Farnese) triggers a bomb which has been hidden under Perlante's bed, killing Alfredo and Perlante's mistress. Perlante calls Luca and tells him about the series of hits. He sets up a meeting between them and the Marsigliese at the local soccer stadium where the Frenchman discusses merging their criminal concerns. Afterwards, Luca meets with his fellow smugglers and persuades them not to accept the Marsigliese demands for the inflow of drugs into their community would only escalate the number of addicts and drug-overdoses, plus they would not receive any profits since the Marsigliese would keep most of the money for himself and his close associates.In response to the Mafia killings, the Naples police chief (Fabio Jovine) orders Captain Tarantino (Venantino Verantini) to conduct a massive sweep of the Neapolitan bay area to clean it up of crime. The dragnet has many smugglers arrested. Luca is saved from a police raid on his house by, of all people, Scherino, who suggests they form an alliance to defeat the Marsiglise. They meet that night at Perlante's house to discuss their plans with him. But Luca soon smells the tell-tale odor of the Marsiglieses personal parfum in the room. Luca realizes that Perlante is in league with the Marsgliese just as the gangster and his henchmen burst into the room and kill all of Scherino's henchmen as well as mortally wound Scherino himself. Luca's split-second reflexes of diving out a glass window and running away from the house ensures his escape. The mortally wounded Scherino manages to shoot off one shot from his gun at the treaterous Perlante, hitting him in the neck, before he drops dead himself.The Marsigliese abducts Luca's wife, Adale, and again insists that Luca should turn over the smuggling network over to his drug operation. To help Luca make up his mind, the sound of Adale being beaten and gang-raped are relayed to Luca over the phone. Luca agrees to the Marsigliese demands. In desperation, Luca calls upon the elderly Don Morrone (Guido Alberti), the leader of the old-guard Italian Mafia who has been reading the news throughout the movie of the numerous killings. Morrone is happy to come out of semi-retirement to deal with the French sadist. Morrone relays his plans to his various middle-aged associates who swing back into action for their cause.The following morning, a meeting between Luca and the Marsigliese in a local open square where the handover to Adele is taking place. Luca sees that it is indeed a set up to have him killed. Don Morrone and his men, using a series of hit-and-run attacks, appear and blast away all of the Marsigliese's henchmen. Luca then chases the crazed Marsigliese through the deserted streets and allyways where after the Frenchman runs down an alley which is a dead end, Luca catches up to him and shoots the Marsigliese dead who lands on a pile of garbage bags. Across down, the police raid the Marsigliese hideout where they find the tramatized Adele and a large stash of cocaine and heroin, while the rest of the Marsigliese henchmen surrender.The final scene has Captain Tarantino meeting with Don Morrone and his housekeeper at a wharf marketplace where the policeman thanks the elderly Mafia don for his tip leading to the discovery of the Marsigliese hideout and drug shipment seizure. But when Tarantino asks Morrone about the murder of the Marsigliese and his men, Morrone claims to know nothing about it, and also not to know Luca Di Angelo. From Tarantino's sarcastic tone of voice, he knows that Morrone is lying. But out of sympathy, the policeman lets Morrone go without arresting him., Question: Who tells Luca about the hit on Mickey?","output":"Part #1: Extract from a movie plot.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Background: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.  Paragraph: Dan studied multicellular organisms that presented mutations. Group A presented gemline mutations, while group B presented somatic mutations. He was fascinated by these organisms.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which group had fewer organisms having mutations that can be passed to the next generation? A:","output":"Group B had fewer organisms having mutations that can be passed to the next generation. This is because, as mentioned in the background information, somatic mutations occur in somatic or body cells and cannot be passed to the offspring. In contrast, germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and have the potential to be passed to the next generation. As a result, organisms in Group A, which presented germline mutations, would have more organisms with mutations that can be inherited by the next generation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

During my days as an inmate in Bridges House at the University of New Brunswick, I shared this space with about 99 other testosterone-addled 'young adults' whose charming tendency to get completely out of hand was barely held in check by the rod of authority of the Don and Resident Fellow. This is not to say that these two worthies weren't good at their jobs; more accurately, their task was more akin to herding cats -- fairly obtuse, barely socialized cats. Given the state of controlled chaos that existed, it wasn't unusual for little conflicts to arise from time to time. Being rather physically small and odd, I came in for a certain amount of abuse from someone called Scut, a large and obnoxious Newfie (hmmm, that's like saying that water is wet). I can't remember what it was he did to me, but it was serious enough that I decided to get my own back. It's been said that revenge is a dish best enjoyed cold. I think revenge is a dish best enjoyed in secret with no chance of counter-revenge to spoil the occasion. And so it was that I laid my plans against Scut. The occasion and place were set. My means of entry was secured. Now I needed material. For me, the only good fish is a live one. Even though I hale from NB, I really don't like free-swimming seafood.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. As noted above, the 9/11 plotters spent somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM, which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and accessed from this country. Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding. We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999. It appears they supported themselves. KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as 10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received 5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States. Financial transactions of the plotters are discussed in more detail in chapter 7. Requirements for a Successful Attack As some of the core operatives prepared to leave for the United States, al Qaeda's leaders could have reflected on what they needed to be able to do in order to organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation to inflict catastrophic harm. We believe such a list of requirements would have included leaders able to evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and direction of the operation; communications sufficient to enable planning and direction of the operatives and those who would be helping them; a personnel system that could recruit candidates, vet them, indoctrinate them, and give them necessary training; an intelligence effort to gather required information and form assessments of enemy strengths and weaknesses; the ability to move people; and the ability to raise and move the necessary money. The information we have presented about the development of the planes operation shows how, by the spring and summer of 2000, al Qaeda was able to meet these requirements. By late May 2000, two operatives assigned to the planes operation were already in the United States. Three of the four Hamburg cell members would soon arrive.  Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Between 400,000 and 560,000.

Mark the water level in the tank with a marker or a pencil. Add coloring or food dye to the water and wait 10 minutes. Check the water in the toilet bowl to see if it’s changed color. Look to see if the water level in the tank has gone up or down. Check if the dyed water from the tank has leaked onto the floor.\\" Article:","output":"Title: A Comprehensive Guide to Identifying Toilet Leaks Through Dye Test Introduction A toilet leak can lead to a significant waste of water, increased utility bills, and potential damage to your bathroom's flooring and structure. Identifying and fixing these leaks is essential in maintaining the functionality and sustainability of your household. This article will guide you through a simple and effective method – the dye test – to detect toilet leaks and provide insights on how to address them. Step 1: Turn Off the Water Supply to the Toilet Before starting the dye test, it is important to turn off the water supply to the toilet. This will help ensure that the dye remains in the tank for the required duration and does not get diluted or flushed during the testing process. Locate the shut-off valve, which is typically found on the wall behind or near the toilet, and turn it clockwise to close it. Step 2: Mark the Water Level in the Tank Next, carefully remove the toilet tank cover and set it aside. Using a marker or pencil, make a visible mark on the inside of the tank to indicate the current water level. The mark will serve as a reference point for detecting any changes in the water level during the test. Step 3: Add Coloring or Food Dye to the Water Add a few drops of food coloring or liquid dye to the water in the toilet tank. Choose a color that contrasts with the natural color of the toilet bowl and tank for better visibility during the test. A darker dye color, such as blue or green, is recommended for clear visibility. Mix the dye in the tank water to ensure even distribution. This dyed water will help identify any leaks by observing changes in color within the toilet bowl or tank. Step 4: Wait 10 Minutes Allow the dye to settle for at least 10 minutes. This duration will give the dye enough time to work its way through the toilet system and reveal any possible leaks. During this time, be sure not to use or flush the toilet to ensure accurate results. Step 5: Check the Water in the Toilet Bowl After the 10-minute waiting period, inspect the water in the toilet bowl. If the dyed water has seeped into the bowl, it indicates a possible leak in the flapper valve or toilet gasket. The flapper valve prevents water from flowing from the tank to the bowl when the toilet is not in use, and a dysfunctional flapper valve can cause constant water leakage into the bowl. Step 6: Look for Changes in the Water Level in the Tank Compare the current water level in the tank to the mark you made earlier. If the water level has dropped below the marked line, it is an indication that there is a leak within the toilet tank. The culprit may be a cracked tank or faulty fill valve. Step 7: Check for Dyed Water Leaks on the Floor Inspect the floor around the base of the toilet for any signs of dyed water. If the dyed water is present on the floor, it may be due to a leak in the wax ring that seals the base of the toilet to the floor or an issue with the fill valve. In some cases, the water may seep between the toilet tank and bowl, which indicates a damaged tank-to-bowl gasket. Conclusion The dye test is an efficient and cost-effective method to detect toilet leaks and identify the source of the problem. By following the steps provided in this guide, you can ensure that your toilet is functioning efficiently and effectively, preventing future costly repairs and water wastage. In case the dye test reveals a leak, it is important to consult with a professional plumber for further assessment and repairs. Maintaining your toilet's functionality and water efficiency not only saves you money but also helps conserve our planet's precious water resources."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:What are the full names of the people who see three ladies washing clothes in a river and singing?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  In 1937 Mississippi during the Great Depression, three convicts, Ulysses Everett McGill, Pete Hogwallop, and Delmar O'Donnell, escape from a chain gang and set out to retrieve a supposed treasure Everett buried, before its locale is flooded to make a lake and provide electricity for the state. The three get a lift from a blind man driving a handcar on a railway. He tells them, among other prophecies, that they will find a fortune but not the one they seek. The trio make their way to the house of Wash, Pete's cousin. They sleep in the barn, but Wash reports them to Sheriff Cooley, who, along with his men, torches the barn. After Pete angrily blows up Cooley's police van, Wash's son helps them escape. Pete and Delmar are baptized by a group of Christians at a river. The group then picks up Tommy Johnson, a young black man, who claims he has sold his soul to the devil in exchange for the ability to play the guitar. In need of money, the four stop at a radio broadcast tower where they record a song as The Soggy Bottom Boys. That night, the trio part ways with Tommy after their car is discovered by the police. Unbeknownst to them, the recording becomes a major hit. The trio inadvertently fall in with bank robber George \\"Baby Face\\" Nelson, and help him with a heist, before he leaves them with his share of the loot. The next day, the group hears singing. They see three ladies washing clothes in a river and singing. The ladies drug them with corn liquor and they lose consciousness. Upon waking, Delmar finds Pete's clothes lying next to him, empty except for a toad. Delmar is convinced the ladies were Sirens and transformed Pete into the toad.

Plot title: The Navy vs. the Night Monsters Movie plot: A group of scientists with Operation Deep Freeze discover frozen prehistoric trees and other specimens in the Antarctic dating back to the first Ice Age. They collect samples of each for further study and load them aboard their C-47 military transport. The dull, workaday life at the Navy weather station base on Gow Island in the South Pacific is interrupted by that very same C-47 transport aircraft. On a routine approach for refueling, the transport experiences unusual trouble and suddenly crash lands on the island's single airstrip, destroying its control tower and the island's only two-way radio. The stricken aircraft also blocks the runway, preventing its further use. Lieutenant Charles Brown (Eisley) is in command of Gow's weather station. He, Navy nurse Nora Hall (Van Doren), and biologist Arthur Beecham (Walter Sande) reach the wreck only to find that seven scientists and crew aboard the cargo aircraft when it left Antarctica are now mysteriously missing. The only one found aboard is the transport's pilot, who is traumatized and in a state of shock, unable to speak. Unloading the prehistoric cargo from the crashed C-47, Dr. Beecham recommends planting the trees to ensure their survival in the island's tropical conditions. Somewhat later, Gow Island's bird population becomes disturbed by something unknown. At the same time, the weather station's scientists try to figure out a connection between this event and a corrosive residue that begins turning up at various island locations. It slowly becomes clear that the planted prehistoric trees have quickly grown into acid-secreting, carnivorous monsters that move about Gow Island at night, at will. They reproduce fast and eventually cut off the island with their growing numbers and nocturnal assaults on Gow's native islanders. Brown has to hold together his dwindling Navy personnel and the coterie of scientists and civilians while figuing out a way to stop this prehistoric menace.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer this question: where is calcium stored in a muscle cell?","output":"Calcium is essential for various cellular functions, including muscle contraction. In a muscle cell, also known as a myocyte, calcium is primarily stored in a specialized organelle called the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The SR is an extensive network of interconnected tubules and cisternae, which are membrane-bound compartments. These specialized compartments are responsible for the calcium storage and regulation functions within the muscle cell. The sarcoplasmic reticulum envelops myofibrils, the long, cylindrical structures within the muscle cell that are responsible for muscle contraction. The SR is particularly abundant in fast-contracting muscle fibers, which rely heavily on rapid calcium release and reuptake for optimal function. Within the SR, calcium ions (Ca2+) bind to a protein called calsequestrin. Calsequestrin has a high capacity for calcium binding, allowing it to store large quantities of calcium ions. This calcium reservoir within the SR remains ready for release when the muscle cell receives a contraction signal from a motor neuron. When a muscle cell is stimulated to contract, an action potential travels along the sarcolemma, the cell membrane of the muscle cell, and into the transverse (T) tubules. T-tubules are invaginations in the sarcolemma that penetrate deep into the muscle cell, allowing the action potential to quickly reach the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The action potential activates voltage-gated calcium channels on the T-tubules called dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs), which in turn activate ryanodine receptors (RyRs) on the SR membrane. The RyRs function as calcium-release channels, permitting the release of stored calcium ions from the SR into the sarcoplasm. The freed calcium ions then bind to troponin, a regulatory protein within the muscle cell's contractile machinery. This binding causes a conformational change in tropomyosin, another regulatory protein, which exposes myosin-binding sites on actin filaments. Myosin, a motor protein, utilizes adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to generate force by binding to actin and producing a power stroke motion, causing the muscle cell to contract. After the contraction, the calcium ions are pumped back into the SR through the action of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA), an ATP-driven calcium pump. The reuptake of calcium ions into the SR lowers the calcium concentration in the sarcoplasm, causing the muscle cell to relax. In summary, calcium is mainly stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum within a muscle cell, where it is bound to calsequestrin. During muscle contraction, the stored calcium ions are released into the sarcoplasm, initiating a series of events that ultimately lead to muscle contraction. After the contraction, calcium ions are actively transported back into the SR, allowing the muscle cell to relax."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: Norman Haines was in a band called Locomotive who released an album calledWe Are Everything You Seearound 1970.Both that album and Den Of Inequity are organ based, slightly psychedelic rock, common in the early 1970s. Picture, at least in parts of this, a heavier Procal Harum.The singer has a high voice that is not that strong, but this actually works well against the big backdrop of the music, which has a very open recording style.Den Of Inequity is not the most original album, but for dynamic art-psych you can't go wrong here, either. Answer: Answer:","output":"Based on the given review, it can be inferred that the user would likely recommend the product, which in this case is the album 'Den of Inequity' by Norman Haines. There are several aspects of the review that support this conclusion: 1. The comparison to Locomotive's album 'We Are Everything You See' and the mention of both albums being organ-based, slightly psychedelic rock indicates that the user is familiar with and appreciates this genre of music. By drawing this connection, the user shows a positive association with both the artist and the style of music. 2. Additionally, the description of the music as \\"dynamic art-psych\\" suggests that the user views the album as a successful and engaging example of this sub-genre of rock music. By using the phrase \\"you can't go wrong,\\" the user implies that this album is a solid choice for those interested in this type of music. 3. While the user does mention that the singer's voice is \\"not that strong,\\" this observation is immediately followed up by stating that it \\"works well against the big backdrop of the music.\\" This suggests that, while the vocals may not be perfect, they are suitable for the overall sound of the album and do not detract from the user's enjoyment of it. 4. Finally, it is worth noting that, although the user acknowledges that 'Den of Inequity' is \\"not the most original album,\\" they do not elaborate on this point or present it as a significant drawback. Instead, they focus on the positive elements of the album, stating that it is a good choice for fans of art-psych rock. In summary, based on the user's review of 'Den of Inequity' by Norman Haines, it is reasonable to conclude that they would recommend the album to others, particularly to those who enjoy organ-based psychedelic rock reminiscent of the early 1970s."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

At the height of his career, Gilbert rivaled Rudolph Valentino, another silent film era leading man, as a box office draw. Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"John Gilbert only did movies with sound\\"?","output":"No, based on the information given in the paragraph, we cannot conclude that John Gilbert only did movies with sound. In fact, it is quite the opposite. John Gilbert rose to fame during the silent film era, meaning that a significant portion, if not the entirety, of his acting career took place before the widespread use of synchronized sound in films. Silent films relied on visual storytelling, and actors like Gilbert had to convey emotions mostly through body language, facial expressions, and other nonverbal cues. The paragraph mentions that Gilbert was a popular leading man known as \\"The Great Lover\\" and even rivaled Rudolph Valentino, another silent film star, in box-office success. This further implies that he was a prominent actor in the silent film era. It is probable that with the advent of talkies (movies with sound), John Gilbert may have transitioned into the new era, possibly working as an actor, screenwriter, or director.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: When did Nine Inch Nails return to touring after its lead singer decided to cease touring with the band? , can you please find it?   Nine Inch Nails, an industrial rock band fronted by Trent Reznor, has toured all over the world since its creation in 1988. While Reznor—the only official member until adding Atticus Ross in 2016—controls its creative and musical direction in the studio, the touring band performs different arrangements of the songs. In addition to regular concerts, the band has performed in both supporting and headlining roles at festivals such as Woodstock '94, Lollapalooza 1991 and 2008, and many other one-off performances including the MTV Video Music Awards. Prior to their 2013 tour, the band had played 938 gigs.Nine Inch Nails' live performances contrast with its in-studio counterpart. Reznor writes and performs nearly all Nine Inch Nails studio material, with occasional instrumental and vocal contributions from others artists. However, Reznor has typically assembled groups of backing musicians to interpret songs for tours and other live performances. Keyboardist Alessandro Cortini said that \\"if you see the show and you're used to the CDs it's pretty clear that the studio entity is different from the live entity\\".The only constant member of the live band is Reznor.  Live Nine Inch Nails performances are typically accompanied by lighting, stage, and video projection effects. Since 1999, the visual design components of live shows have been curated by Reznor with Rob Sheridan. Three tours have been chronicled on live albums and tour documentaries. Critical and commercial response to Nine Inch Nails live performances has generally been positive. Critics have pointed to the concerts' aggressive on-stage dynamic and visual designs as high points. Reznor decided in 2008 to cease touring with the band after a 2009 farewell tour. The band resumed touring in 2013, with the group planning a set of concerts in the U.S. beginning September 28. Answer:","output":"Nine Inch Nails returned to touring in 2013 after its lead singer, Trent Reznor, decided to cease touring with the band in 2008. The band had a farewell tour in 2009 and then took a hiatus from touring until resuming with a series of concerts in the U.S. starting on September 28th, 2013."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: The 18-year-old was waiting at a bus stop on Beeston Road when she was dragged into a garden and sexually assaulted on the night of 6 March. The CCTV footage shows the man following another woman off Wellington Street on the night of the attack. West Yorkshire Police has appealed on BBC Crimewatch for her to come forward. Detectives said the victim was left with serious head injuries and a fractured pelvis when she was struck over the head numerous times with a large stone before being raped at about 22:30 GMT. In a reconstruction on the programme, the victim spoke of her ordeal, which was voiced by an actor. She said: \\"I haven't been able to stop thinking about what happened. I've stopped sleeping because I can see what happened when I am trying to sleep.\\" Det Sup Nick Wallen said: \\"This was an appalling attack on a young woman where a shocking level of violence was used which could so easily have had fatal consequences. \\"It has understandably had a very significant traumatic effect on the victim.\\". \\"We are hopeful that the woman shown being followed, who we have not yet identified, will come forward as a result of this new appeal.\\" Mr Wallen said the force was \\"continuing to conduct a very wide range of enquiries to identify\\" the attacker. Detectives previously released CCTV footage, images and a description of the attacker, who is thought to be in his early 20s and of Pakistani or Middle Eastern origin. On the night of the attack, he was wearing a green Puma hooded top and white trainers. An image of a footwear mark recovered from the victim's clothing was also released.

Q:Article: World Car Free Day is a very important day on the environmental calendar. Every September 22, governments, green groups and ordinary citizens stress the damage cars are doing to the earth. The day is a reminder that we do not need to rely so much on cars. Those who take part in the activity hope that we all should realize we do not have to accept our car-controlled society.     Carlos Pardo from Colombia's Sustainable Urban Transport Project said, \\"World Car Free Day is not only a celebration of fun ways to get around the city, but a demonstration of traffic-free streets and clean air is possible. But we do not want just one day of celebration and then a return to normal life. When people get out of their cars, they should stay out of their cars. It is up to us, our cities and our governments to help create lasting change to benefit walkers, cyclists and other people who do not drive cars. \\"     Car-free days were organized as early as during the 1970s, and several car-free days were organized in European cities during the early 1990s. An international car-free day was organized in Europe in 1999. The European Union adopted the idea in 2000. Today, as many as 100 million people in over 1500 cities worldwide celebrate this day.     World Car Free Day aims to take a large number of cars off the streets for all or part of a day. This will give people a chance to see what their town might look like with fewer cars. But some people say it is a one-day trick and does not make people give up their cars for the rest of the year.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the real name of the person whose father brought home a collection of American 45s?, using the article: Bowie was born David Robert Jones on 8 January 1947 in Brixton, London. His mother, Margaret Mary \\"Peggy\\" (née Burns; 2 October 1913 – 2 April 2001), was born at Shorncliffe Army Camp near Cheriton, Kent. Her paternal grandparents were Irish immigrants who had settled in Manchester. She worked as a waitress at a cinema in Royal Tunbridge Wells. His father, Haywood Stenton \\"John\\" Jones (21 November 1912 – 5 August 1969), was from Doncaster, and worked as a promotions officer for the children's charity Barnardo's. The family lived at 40 Stansfield Road, on the boundary between Brixton and Stockwell in the south London borough of Lambeth. Bowie attended Stockwell Infants School until he was six years old, acquiring a reputation as a gifted and single-minded child—and a defiant brawler.In 1953, Bowie moved with his family to Bromley. Two years later, he started attending Burnt Ash Junior School. His voice was considered \\"adequate\\" by the school choir, and he demonstrated above-average abilities in playing the recorder. At the age of nine, his dancing during the newly-introduced music and movement classes was strikingly imaginative: teachers called his interpretations \\"vividly artistic\\" and his poise \\"astonishing\\" for a child. The same year, his interest in music was further stimulated when his father brought home a collection of American 45s by artists including the Teenagers, the Platters, Fats Domino, Elvis Presley, and Little Richard. Upon listening to Little Richard's song \\"Tutti Frutti\\", Bowie would later say that he had \\"heard God\\".Bowie was first impressed with Presley when he saw his cousin dance to \\"Hound Dog\\". By the end of the following year, he had taken up the ukulele and tea-chest bass, begun to participate in skiffle sessions with friends, and had started to play the piano; meanwhile, his stage presentation of numbers by both Presley and Chuck Berry—complete with gyrations in tribute to the original artists—to his local Wolf Cub group was described as \\"mesmerizing ... like someone from another..., what would be the answer ?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Communication within peer groups allows adolescents to explore their feelings and identity as well as develop and evaluate their social skills. Peer groups offer members the opportunity to develop social skills such as empathy, sharing, and leadership. Adolescents choose peer groups based on characteristics similarly found in themselves. By utilizing these relationships, adolescents become more accepting of who they are becoming. Group norms and values are incorporated into an adolescent’s own self-concept. Through developing new communication skills and reflecting upon those of their peers, as well as self-opinions and values, an adolescent can share and express emotions and other concerns without fear of rejection or judgment. Peer groups can have positive influences on an individual, such as on academic motivation and performance. However, while peers may facilitate social development for one another they may also hinder it. Peers can have negative influences, such as encouraging experimentation with drugs, drinking, vandalism, and stealing through peer pressure. Susceptibility to peer pressure increases during early adolescence, peaks around age 14, and declines thereafter. Further evidence of peers hindering social development has been found in Spanish teenagers, where emotional (rather than solution-based) reactions to problems and emotional instability have been linked with physical aggression against peers. Both physical and relational aggression are linked to a vast number of enduring psychological difficulties, especially depression, as is social rejection. Because of this, bullied adolescents often develop problems that lead to further victimization. Bullied adolescents are both more likely to continued to be bullied and to bully others in the future. However, this relationship is less stable in cases of cyberbullying, a relatively new issue among adolescents.

Luckily, these \\"new\\" worries only stick around  for a little while. Let's find out more about going to a new school. Most teachers kick the new school year by introducing themselves and talking about all the stuff you'll be doing that year. Some teachers give students a chance to tell something about themselves to the rest of the class, too. When teachers do the talking on the first day, they often go over classroom rules and school rules so you'll know what's allowed and what's not. Please pay close attention. You might already know a lot of people in your classes on the first day, but it's a great day to make a new friend, so try to say hello to kids you know and new ones that you don't. Make the first move and you'll be glad you did, and so will your new friend! Seeing friends you haven't seen in a while can make the first day a good one. You can make the day feel special by wearing clothes that you really like. Maybe you got a great T-shirt on one of your vacations, or a pair of sneakers .

Growing a cover crop extends the time for AM growth into the autumn, winter, and spring. Promotion of hyphal growth creates a more extensive hyphal network. The mycorrhizal colonization increase found in cover crops systems may be largely attributed to an increase in the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop (Boswell et al. 1998). The extraradical mycelia are able to survive the winter, providing rapid spring colonization and early season symbiosis (McGonigle and Miller 1999). This early symbiosis allows plants to tap into the well-established hyphal network and be supplied with adequate phosphorus nutrition during early growth, which greatly improves the crop yield.  and the situation: Two farms were testing new methods to increase production. Timber farm used AM fungi, while Pine farm used other conventional agricultural methods.  Answer the following question: Which farm didn't provide more time for AM fungi growth into the spring?

Write some highlights for the following article: The first child in Britain known to have been screened as an embryo to ensure she did not carry a cancer gene was born Friday, a spokesman for University College London told CNN. Genetic screening allows lab-fertilized embryos to be tested for genes likely to lead to later health problems. Her embryo was screened in a lab days after conception to check for the BRCA-1 gene, linked to breast and ovarian cancer. People with the gene are known to have a 50-80 percent chance of developing breast or ovarian cancer in their lifetimes. British newspapers have dubbed the girl the \\"cancer-free\\" baby. \\"This little girl will not face the specter of developing this genetic form of breast cancer or ovarian cancer in her adult life,\\" said Paul Serhal, a consultant at University College London Hospital and Medical Director of the Assisted Conception Unit. \\"The parents will have been spared the risk of inflicting this disease on their daughter. The lasting legacy is the eradication of the transmission of this form of cancer that has blighted these families for generations.\\" Yet not everyone is thrilled with the idea of testing embryos for genes that could cause health problems later in life, a process known as preimplanatation genetic diagnosis. \\"This is not a cure for breast cancer,\\" said Josephine Quintavalle, co-founder of Comment on Reproductive Ethics, which describes itself as group that focuses on ethical dilemmas related to reproduction. What do you think about testing embryos for gene defects? \\"This is simply a mechanism for eliminating the birth of anybody (prone to) the disease,\\" she said. \\"It is basically a search-and-kill mechanism.\\" She opposes the procedure because embryos found to carry disease-causing genes often are discarded. She says that is essentially murder. \\"They will be destroyed,\\" she said. \\"They will never be allowed to live.\\" Doctors in Britain and elsewhere increasingly test embryos for genes that are certain to cause illnesses such as cystic fibrosis or Huntington's Disease. What's different about the girl born Friday is that she is the first infant known to have been tested in Britain as an embryo for a gene that is merely likely -- not certain -- to cause disease. In the United States, geneticists are free to test for any condition for which they can develop a probe -- and they're free to look for genes that are certain to cause diseases as well as genes that merely may pose problems later in life. Quintavalle opposes any form of in-vitro fertilization where embryos are \\"killed,\\" she said. But she is particularly troubled by the idea of screening an embryo for the BRCA-1 gene because carriers of the gene do not always develop the disease, and the disease is not always fatal. \\"The message we are sending is: 'Better off dead than carrying (a gene linked to) breast cancer,'\\" she said. \\"We have gone very much down the proverbial slippery slope.\\" Peter Braude, one of the top British experts on the genetic testing of embryos, said he understands the ethical objections but focuses on the benefits. \\"There has always been a vociferous group in opposition,\\" he said. But \\"there are people who can benefit and I think they should be allowed to do so.\\" In fact, he argues that the procedure actually prevents abortions because it takes place on a three-day old embryo in a lab. Only embryos that lack the defective gene are implanted. \\"I don't think you can equate eight cells in a dish to an embryo or a child,\\" said Braude, head of the department of women's health at the King's College London School of Medicine. For many couples, the alternative to testing an embryo is to conceive a child naturally and test the fetus weeks or months into a pregnancy. Some couples opt for an abortion when such testing reveals a defect. Diagnosing an embryo genetically typically involves fertilizing an egg with a sperm in a lab, testing the resulting embryo and implanting it in the mother if no defects are found. Braude agrees that testing for diseases that may not be fatal -- or may not manifest themselves for decades -- raises thorny ethical questions. \\"How serious does it have to be before you throw away an embryo?\\" he asked. \\"Are you prepared to throw away a 16-week embryo for Huntington's, which will not manifest until age 40?\\" In Britain, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority determines the conditions for which geneticists can test. It has approved testing for more than 60 conditions since it was established in 1990. The authority approved testing for the BRCA-1 gene in 2008. Dr. Mark Hughes, who founded a genetics clinic in the United States, said he likes the idea of an authority that regulates what tests can be performed -- the system in place in Britain -- but believes that parents who want to test for genetic abnormalities should be allowed to do so. At his Genesis Genetics Institute in Detroit, Michigan, Hughes carries out about two tests a month for BRCA-1 or BRCA-2, a related gene. \\"The couple is the best one to be making these decisions, because they live with these diseases,\\" he said. \\"When it hits your family over and over again, many couples are saying: 'Enough of this. Let's prune this out of our family tree forever.'\\" He rejects the notion that parents will use genetic testing to remove all imperfections from children. \\"You can get up on your high horse and say people are looking for perfect children, but let's give these families more credit,\\" he said. \\"They just want one that has a fighting chance of not having a disease.\\" Hughes said he doubts genetic screening will ever be used to test all babies. That's partly because it costs the equivalent of about 11,755 -- 8,000 British pounds -- to screen embryos. It's also because the process is very complex. \\"It's gotten easier to do now than it was 19 years ago,\\" when Hughes did his first test for cystic fibrosis, he said. \\"But it has not exploded, not burst onto the medical field like some technologies do. \\"No one would use these technologies for a trivial reason. It's too much effort,\\" he said. \\"Not just the money -- it's so many hoops to jump through for a couple that would prefer to make their baby on vacation rather than in a clinic.\\" Highlights:","output":"1. A baby girl was born in Britain who was screened as an embryo to make sure she didn't have a cancer gene. 2. The doctors checked her for the BRCA-1 gene, which is linked to breast and ovarian cancer. 3. This screening helped her parents know their baby wouldn't have a high chance of developing these cancers later in life. 4. Some people are not happy with this kind of testing because they feel it's not ethical (or right) to choose embryos based on their genes. 5. Screening for genetic issues can be helpful for families with a history of certain diseases, but it also brings up questions about how far we should go in trying to make sure our babies are \\"perfect\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While at home, Carrie is tormented by her delusional mother (Piper Laurie), who locks Carrie in a closet and forces her to pray--she believes that Carrie received her period due to sinning.Miss Collins, still livid about the incident, berates the other girls and forces them through a detention, deliberately physically exhausting them.

Next question: what disease does thomas have in the man in the high castle?","output":"In the Amazon television series, \\"The Man in the High Castle,\\" Thomas Smith (played by Quinn Lord) suffers from a disease called Landouzy-Dejerine Syndrome. This affliction is a form of muscular dystrophy, more specifically called facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). FSHD is a genetic disorder that leads to progressive weakness and atrophy of the muscles in the face, shoulders, and upper arms. The onset of FSHD symptoms typically begins during adolescence or early adulthood, although the severity and progression of the condition can vary significantly among individuals. As the disease advances, it can lead to difficulty in facial expressions, lifting objects, and even performing daily tasks. Over time, affected individuals may experience difficulty swallowing, speaking, or even breathing. Landouzy-Dejerine Syndrome is caused by a genetic mutation on chromosome 4. It is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, which means that an affected individual has a 50% chance of passing the disorder on to each of their children. In the context of \\"The Man in the High Castle,\\" the disease plays a significant role in the overall storyline and impacts the character's life in various ways. The series is set in an alternate history where the Axis Powers (Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan) won World War II, resulting in a totalitarian regime that values genetic purity above all else.  Thomas Smith, son of John Smith (an important character in the show), hides his condition from the authorities, as it is seen as a genetic defect that could lead to extermination under the eugenic policies of the Nazi regime. The struggle to conceal his illness highlights the danger associated with any deviation from the Nazi ideal of \\"perfection\\" and adds emotional depth to the story.

Two weeks ago, at a news conference, Kratz apologized for sending personal texts to a domestic abuse victim while prosecuting her former boyfriend. At the time, he said he wouldn't step down from office. Wisconsin Department of Justice officials said some of Kratz's texts \\"cross the line and can be construed as sexual harassment.\\" They cited a specific text that refers to the woman as a \\"tall, young, hot nymph,\\" and another that says, \\"You are beautiful and would make a great partner someday.\\" E-mails from November 2009 between Kratz and the Wisconsin Department of Justice show Kratz denied wrongdoing for weeks before finally saying, \\"My behavior was inappropriate.\\" Kratz also recently went on medical leave. In recent months, several local and state domestic violence organizations have called on Kratz to resign as district attorney. CNN's Chuck Johnston and Antoinette Campbell contributed to this report.

Given the answer options provided, it seems that the question is asking about the function of electrical power when it runs through a circuit. In this context, the right answer should not be \\"works properly,\\" as this does not accurately describe the role of electrical power in a circuit. Electrical power, or the rate at which energy is transferred or converted within a circuit, serves to transfer energy when it passes through a circuit. This energy can be used to run various electrical appliances, perform work, or create other forms of energy, such as light and heat. Therefore, the more accurate response to the question would be, \\"Electrical power transfers energy when it runs through the circuit.\\""},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The official told CNN foreign affairs reporter Elise Labott that the decision was made because of improved relations over the past year. Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who was elected in May, is scheduled to meet President Barack Obama at the White House on Wednesday. \\"The visit will highlight the importance and resilience of the U.S.-Pakistan relationship,\\" a White House statement said. Tensions with Pakistan escalated after the U.S. military raid that killed Osama bin Laden in 2011. Pakistan expelled some American military trainers, and some U.S. aid was halted that year. The discovery of bin Laden in a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, highlighted suspicions by American leaders that some Pakistani security forces may have collaborated with terrorists. Obama chose not to alert Pakistan's authorities before the U.S. raid. Meanwhile, popular opinion in Pakistan has been inflamed by the U.S. incursion to kill bin Laden as well as U.S. drone strikes against suspected terrorists. Sharif promised in his election campaign to try to improve relations with India, a rivalry that underlies the fears of Pakistan's security forces. He was vague about terrorism and other issues of interest to the United States, but analysts said Sharif worked well with U.S. officials as Prime Minister during the 1990s.
