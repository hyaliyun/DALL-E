They hold to the early Muslims' understanding of Islamic theology, known as Salaf al-Salih (the pious predecessors), which includes the first three generations of Muslims after the Prophet Muhammad. The term 'Athari' comes from 'athar', referring to the narrations or traditions of the Prophet and his companions. Key beliefs and principles of the Athari school include: 1. **Primacy of Texts**: Atharis give precedence to the texts of the Quran and the Hadith over human opinion and rational speculation. They reject the use of philosophical theology (kalam) to explain matters of the unseen or divine attributes, which they believe should be accepted as they have come in the texts without interpretation (ta'wil) or anthropomorphic analogies (tashbih). 2. **Understanding of God's Attributes**: Atharis affirm all of the divine attributes mentioned in the Quran and Hadith according to their 'apparent' (dhahir) meaning, but without delving into how these attributes are manifested (bi la kayf). They reject any attempt to allegorize or rationalize these attributes, emphasizing that nothing is like unto God. 3. **Adherence to the Salaf**: Atharis strive to adhere strictly to the practices and beliefs of the first generations of Muslims, arguing that these represent the purest form of Islam. 4. **Rejection of Innovation (Bid'ah)**: They strongly oppose any innovation in religion that has no basis in the Quran or Sunnah, categorizing such practices as bid'ah and considering them a deviation from the true path. 5. **Reliance on Authentic Hadith**: Atharis place a strong emphasis on the authenticity of Hadith and typically engage in meticulous scrutiny of hadith chains of narration to determine the reliability of the traditions of the Prophet. 6. **Critique of Other Legal Schools**: Atharis may critique the other Sunni schools of thought for what they see as an over-reliance on juristic reasoning (ra'y) and consensus (ijma') that is not directly tied to the texts. 7. **Eschatology**: They uphold traditional Sunni views on matters of eschatology, such as belief in the physical resurrection, the day of judgment, heaven and hell, and the signs of the hour. 8. **Unity and Community**: Atharis emphasize the importance of unity among Muslims and encourage following the community (ummah), acknowledging the authority of duly appointed leaders (as long as they are not openly unjust or un-Islamic). The Athari approach to theology has been influential in the development of various Islamic movements, particularly the contemporary Salafi movement, which often looks to Athari theology as a basis for its teachings. Despite these distinctive theological and jurisprudential stances, Atharis engage in the basic religious practices common to all Sunni Muslims, such as the five pillars of Islam, while emphasizing a strict adherence to the Prophet's example."},{"instruction":"what do asharis believe","output":"The Ash'ari school is one of the main theological schools within Sunni Islam, founded by Imam Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari in the late 9th and early 10th centuries. The Ash'ari school arose as a response to the purely literalist interpretations of the Quran and Hadith by the Atharis (traditionalists) and the rationalist doctrines of the Mu'tazila, who placed great emphasis on reason and held controversial positions, such as the creation of the Quran and the denial of God's attributes. Key beliefs and principles of the Ash'ari school include: 1. **Divine Attributes**: Ash'aris affirm all of the divine attributes mentioned in the Quran and Hadith, but they interpret these attributes in a manner that seeks to avoid anthropomorphism and likening God to creation (tashbih) while also avoiding negating (ta'til) what has been attributed to God. They maintain a balance between the literal meanings of the attributes and unfathomable transcendence. 2. **Use of Reason**: Ash'aris advocate for the use of reason (kalam) to defend the principles of Islamic belief against heretical views but always within the bounds that do not contradict the Quran and Sunnah. They argue that reason can confirm and complement the truths found in revelation. 3. **Free Will and Predestination**: Regarding the question of free will and predestination (qadar), Ash'aris adopt a middle position, affirming that God has predetermined all events but that humans have acquired (kasb) actions. Essentially, humans possess a measure of free will to choose their actions, yet God is the ultimate creator of those actions. 4. **Salvation and Intercession**: Ash'aris believe that faith (iman) consists of affirmation by the heart, expression by the tongue, and action by the limbs. This means that faith increases with good deeds and may decrease with sins. However, major sins, in their view, do not necessarily condemn a person to eternal damnation as long as they profess faith. Intercession (shafa'a) by the Prophet Muhammad and the saints is a hope held for the sinful believers. 5. **Consensus (Ijma)**: Ash'aris place a significant emphasis on the consensus of the scholars (ijma) as a source of Islamic law and belief, arguing that the Muslim community as a whole cannot agree on an error. 6. **Just Ruler and Rebellion**: They typically hold that a just ruler should be obeyed, and they generally oppose rebellion against a ruler unless he is outrightly tyrannical and impious. The Ash'ari theology has historically been widely accepted in the Sunni Muslim world, with a considerable following among Muslims, especially in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. It has been notably influential in shaping the mainstream understanding of Sunni theology, particularly during the classical and medieval periods of Islamic history. Ash'ari scholars have also been active in the other disciplines of Islamic learning, including fiqh (jurisprudence) and hadith. Despite their specific theological principles, Ash'aris practice the same fundamental tenets of Islam—the five pillars—and engage in the same religious observances as other Sunni Muslims. The differences with other schools are largely related to subtle points of creed and theology rather than the overarching principles of the Islamic faith."},{"instruction":"what do maturindi's believe","output":"The Maturidi school is one of the two main schools of Sunni Islamic theology, founded by Abu Mansur al-Maturidi in the 10th century CE, based in Samarkand. While similar to the Ash'ari school in many respects, particularly in their response to the Mu'tazilites and their use of reason in theology, the Maturidi school has its own distinct beliefs and principles: 1. **Divine Attributes**: Like the Ash'aris, Maturidis affirm the attributes of God mentioned in the Quran and the Hadith, avoiding anthropomorphic interpretations. They often emphasize God's transcendence and maintain a balance between literalism and allegorical interpretations. 2. **Human Reason & Free Will**: Maturidis place slightly more emphasis on human reason than Ash'aris, especially with regard to discerning good and bad in the absence of revelation. They also have a nuanced stance on free will; while God's omniscience and omnipotence include the creation of all actions, humans have a type of \\"acquisition\\" (iktisab) or capacity that allows them to earn the results of their actions, giving them a level of responsibility. 3. **Faith & Acts**: Maturidis generally hold that faith (iman) does not increase or decrease because of one's actions; rather, it remains constant as long as one affirms the central tenets of Islam. This contrasts with the Ash'ari view that faith can increase with good deeds and decrease with bad deeds. 4. **Role of Revelation and Reason**: Maturidis assert that reason alone is sufficient to establish basic moral and theological concepts even before receiving divine guidance. Nonetheless, revelation is essential for detailed religious knowledge and for matters that reason cannot fully grasp. 5. **Intercession & Salvation**: Similar to Ash'aris, Maturidis believe in intercession (shafa'ah) on the Day of Judgment for sinful believers. They also hold the view that major sins do not necessarily lead to eternal damnation, provided the person does not die in a state of disbelief. 6. **Society & Governance**: Maturidis typically support the idea of an established leadership and are against rebellion, similar to Ash'aris unless the ruler is oppressive and irreligious. The Maturidi school has traditionally been influential in regions where Turkic and Persian cultures have been prominent, notably in Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent, as well as in the Turkish Ottoman Empire. Today, it remains a predominant school of theology for Sunnis in Turkey, Central Asia, and parts of the Arab world. In practice, Maturidis follow the same fundamental tenets of Islam—the five pillars—and engage in the same religious observances as other Sunni Muslims. Like the Ash'aris, the main differences between Maturidis and other theological schools lie in detailed points of creed and theological reasoning rather than the broader principles of the Islamic faith."},{"instruction":"If small glass beads are wrapped in meat, is the composite considered a type of meat?","output":"The concept you're describing is not customary in food classification and could raise concerns regarding food safety.

It was a formidable day for a match between the acclaimed Malory Towers and their long-standing rivals, St Clare’s. Their fierce but friendly rivalry was the talk of the school year, and this match promised to be a legendary battle. The girls of Malory Towers huddled together, their breaths visible in the air, as Darrell Rivers, the team captain with steely determination glittering in her eyes, rallied her teammates. \\"Remember, girls,\\" she urged with urgency in her tone. \\"We know this field better than anyone. Our heart, our fight, is what makes us Malory Towers. Let's leave everything we have out on that muddy battleground!\\" The pitch was a quagmire; the recent rains had seen to that. Yet the Malory Towers girls stood undaunted. Alicia Johns, with a glint of excitement in her eye, surveyed the pitch. She loved the physicality of rugby, the way it allowed her to channel her boundless energy. She caught sight of her mother, standing on the sidelines, an expression of anticipation on her face, tinged with a hint of concern. As the whistle blew, the match commenced with a thud, the ball kicked deep into St Clare’s territory. Muddy sprays were quick to rise as the players battled it out, neither willing to concede a single inch without a fight. The game was ferociously close, with both sides displaying formidable tackling, scrappy rucks, and surging mauls. Alicia played with a fire burning within her; she drove through the muck and mire, side-stepping and ploughing through would-be tacklers. During the early skirmishes of the first half, a chance appeared like a beacon in the storm. Alicia seized the ball from a fumbled pass, heart pounding, she sprinted toward the try line, her boots sliding and churning through the sloppy terrain. Her mother gasped, unable to look away as her seemingly delicate girl transformed into a force of nature. With a graceful dive, Alicia plunged over into a tremendous mud puddle right past the try line, scoring for Malory Towers. Cheers erupted, and for a moment, the gray skies parted in the hearts of the observers. Alicia's mother stood, shocked yet bursting with pride at the sight of her spirited daughter, radiant even when draped in mud. At halftime, the winds continued to howl, the mud ever-present, an additional opponent on the field. The girls gathered together, steaming breath mixing with the chill in the air. \\"This mud is an ally, not a foe,\\" announced Mary-Lou, her face smeared with the earthy battle paint. \\"Look at St Clare's, they're not accustomed to these slippery conditions. Let's drag them into the deepest parts of the mire. They'll tire, they'll slip, and we'll be the last ones standing firmly in this slop!\\" With renewed focus, Malory Towers took to the field, implementing their strategy of attrition. They kept the play in the soupiest segments of the pitch, tackling with gusto and pushing St Clare's back with relentless zeal. Lumbering forwards such as Wilhelmina 'Bill' Robinson dominated the rucks, while agile backs like Sally Hope darted around, creating opportunities. Mud flew with each grunting scrum, with Malory Towers emerging filthy but unbowed. Spectators could barely discern the original colours of the jerseys, but they could see the fierceness of the game unfold. As the match wore on, St Clare’s began to falter, the quagmire claiming their energy, sapping their pace. Malory Towers capitalized, setting up another swift play when Irene caught the ball from a lineout and tossed it out to Darrell who faked left, then burst right, plunging through St Clare's faltering defense to score another try. The final whistle was a song of victory; the pitch, a scene of triumph and jubilation. Malory Towers had emerged victorious, prevailing in the battle of the mire. Alicia's mother raced to embrace her muddied warrior, seeing not the delicate girl she once was, but the robust athlete she'd become. They had played with the very heart of Malory Towers within them, fearless and brave, under skies ominous and terrain treacherous. The challenge had been met with mirth, and on this day, victory was theirs to claim."},{"instruction":"What did Alicia look like before and after scoring her try?

Her jersey would have been dark blue with the school crest prominently displayed, the fabric clean and crisp, her matching shorts neatly fitted. Her hair would have been tightly secured in a practical ponytail or braid to keep it out of her face during the game, and her tall, athletic frame poised and ready for action. Her skin would have been clean and her expression alight with anticipation and competitiveness, eyes scanning the field for the openings and opportunities inherent in the game of rugby. As Alicia hurtled towards the try line and executed her decisive scoring dive, the transformation would have been substantial. The formerly pristine blue of her Malory Towers jersey would now be splattered and smeared with the brown mud that coated the pitch, bearing the marks of her daring play. Streaks of mud would adorn her face, her hair possibly loosened from its binds by the force of her athletic maneuvers, with additional strands sticking to her muddied cheeks. Her appearance upon rising from her successful dive would have shown a complete embrace of the game's rough-and-tumble nature—her kit entirely changed in hue from clean blue to a mottled brown, her skin sporting patterns of mud, and her once-neat hair now a wilder version of her active self. Yet, despite the layers of grime, Alicia’s triumphant grin would have shone through, her eyes sparkling with the thrill of the score, and her entire demeanor radiating the joy and intensity of the moment. The transformation from a tidy athlete to a muddy rugby hero would have been emblematic of the spirit of Malory Towers and the tenacity of the girls who played for it."},{"instruction":"Please write an exciting, realistic story about a rugby match between Malory Towers and St Clare’s in the style of Enid Blyton’s early school stories.

It was the much-anticipated showdown between the mighty Malory Towers and their age-old rivals, St Clare's. The air buzzed with excitement as the two teams took to the field amidst cheers from their loyal supporters. The girls of Malory Towers were a sight to behold in their navy jerseys and muddy boots, their faces set with determination. Among them was Alicia, whose mother was nestled in the crowd, peering through her binoculars with a mixture of anticipation and anxiety. Mrs. Johns had only heard of her daughter's newfound love for the 'uncivilised' sport through letters, and she was now witnessing it firsthand. As the whistle blew, the match erupted into action. Balls were passed with precision despite slick fingers, and the thud of boots echoed as they kicked up clumps of earth. Alicia was in her element, her usually pristine curls now adorned with specks of mud. In a decisive moment, Alicia received the ball from Irene, darted past a St Clare's forward, and charged toward the muddiest part of the pitch. The girls heeded Alicia's earlier advice: \\"Keep the play in the worst of the mud—our boots know these bogs better than theirs!\\" The St Clare's players floundered in the slush, their unfamiliarity with such conditions clear. Alicia wove through them, her agility a sight to behold. Just ahead lay the try line, guarded by a final opponent. With a feint to the left and a swift sidestep to the right, Alicia left the St Clare's player grasping at thin air as she sprinted forward. Feet away from scoring, Alicia could almost hear her heart pounding louder than the cheers. Then, with a powerful leap, she dove, ball in hand, towards the try line. She landed with a victorious splash, in a vast puddle of mud, the ball firmly grounded. The crowd erupted, the Malory Towers supporters jumped up, screaming themselves hoarse. Mrs. Johns, mouth agape, was splashed with mud by a nearby enthusiastic fan. Shock mixed with an odd sense of pride, and her gaze softened. The delicate girl she had sent to Malory Towers was now a fierce, mud-splattered rugby player—and she was her daughter. Alicia sprang up, not a trace of her old prissiness, grinning from ear to ear, her face daubed with mud like a badge of honour as her teammates swarmed her with back-slapping congratulations. The match continued, with St Clare's mounting a solid defence. Each tackle, ruck, and maul was met with grit and vigour from both sides. The Malory girls, embracing the sludge, seemed to gain energy from it, their robustness and strategy wearing down the St Clare's team play by play. Betty, Malory Towers' scrum-half, scooped the ball from a messy ruck and spun out a slick pass to Alison, who charged through the St Clare's line like a bulldozer. The ground shook beneath the girls' tackles, their jerseys now barely distinguishable from the brown of the earth. In the dying minutes of the game, with the score perilously close, Darrell, Malory's captain, rallied her troops for one final push. \\"To the last minute, to the last second, we fight on!\\" And fight they did. With a supreme effort, Malory Towers advanced, inch by painstaking inch, closer to victory. As the final whistle blew, the scoreline was in Malory's favour. The girls of Malory Towers cheered and hugged, their laughter mingling with the rain that had begun to lightly fall, turning the pitch into an even muddier mess. Alicia, panting and elated, looked up to find her mother weaving through the crowd to her. \\"Darling, you were splendid,\\" Mrs. Johns exclaimed, her voice trembling with an emotion she herself hadn't expected. She wrapped Alicia in a towel, the two of them sharing a look that spoke of mutual admiration and an unspoken understanding—Alicia had not only found her passion but had proven her might in the gloriously muddy trenches of Malory Towers rugby."},{"instruction":"What did Alicia look like before and after scoring her try? Did her appearance change much? Was it possible to see the color of her kit, skin and hair after?","output":"Before scoring her try, Alicia likely presented the classic image of a Malory Towers girl ready for a sporting challenge. Her hair, typically well-kept with perhaps a sensible braid or ponytail to keep it out of her face during the game, would have been its natural color, with perhaps a ribbon in her school's colors as a touch of school spirit. Her kit, a navy jersey emblazoned with the school crest, would have been clean but for a few splatters that came from warming up on the muddy field, and her shorts and long socks would have matched, providing a sharp contrast to the green of the pitch. Her skin, clean and perhaps flushed with the excitement and exertion of the game, would have been visible, along with any features that distinguish her like freckles or a bright smile. After she scored her try by diving into a large mud puddle, Alicia's appearance would have changed drastically. Her hair would be matted with mud, damp strands sticking to her forehead and cheeks, the former braid or ponytail likely coming loose from the action. The ribbon might be barely visible or come off entirely, lost somewhere in the mire. Her jersey, shorts, and socks would be smeared with mud to the extent that the navy blue of her kit would be obscured, only hints of the original color peeking through the brown sludge. Her skin would be streaked with the earthy hues of the playing field, and her distinctive facial features would be camouflaged beneath the layers of mud that splashed up during her dive. Alicia might be recognizable only by her form, the number on her back if it were still visible, and her exuberant body language that would surely reflect her personality and enthusiasm. Her mother, seeing her from the sideline, would recognize her daughter more by her style of play and mannerisms than by her temporarily transformed appearance."},{"instruction":"Would Alicia have been somewhat muddy before scoring her try, given the conditions and the fact that she had been participating in the game? I see that the Malory Towers jerseys were navy, what color were the shorts and socks? What were the Malory Towers school colors?","output":"Certainly, Alicia would have already been somewhat muddy before scoring her try, as the conditions of the pitch were described as very muddy from the outset. Rugby, being a contact and ground sport, inevitably involves all players in scrums, tackles, and rucks that would get them covered in mud, especially on a wet and muddy pitch. As such, even before her spectacular dive for the try, Alicia would have been speckled with mud and splashes that came from both the ball and the field, as well as from contact with other players. In Enid Blyton's school stories, details such as the specific color of the shorts and socks might not be consistently mentioned. However, we can imagine that the Malory Towers uniform would have a coordinated appearance. Given that the jerseys were navy, the shorts and socks might also have been navy, white, or possibly another complementary color that represents the school. For the purposes of our story, let's say they were white to offer a contrast with the navy jersey, though this would mean they wouldn't have stayed white for long due to the muddy conditions. Malory Towers school colors, as described in Enid Blyton's books, are not explicitly given for sporting kits. However, it is commonly thought that the school colors are navy and red, a classic combination for a school of such distinction and tradition. With this in mind, Alicia's clean rugby kit would have likely featured these colors— a navy jersey perhaps with red trim or accents, white shorts, and socks that either matched the shorts or featured stripes or bands of the school's colors. After scoring, all elements of her kit would have been heavily streaked and splattered with mud, making the colors difficult to distinguish."},{"instruction":"","output":"It looks like your latest message may have been sent by mistake without any content.

Could the school have chosen red shorts, if the school colors were navy and red? Or would that not have been a pleasing combination of colors?","output":"In practical terms, it might indeed have been better to avoid white kit for rugby, especially considering the likelihood of getting it stained with grass and mud. However, historically, many sports uniforms have featured white prominently due to its crisp, clean appearance, and the contrast it provides against a playing field, making players easily distinguishable. The challenges of cleaning the kit were often accepted as part of the sport. Malory Towers could certainly have chosen red shorts if their school colors are navy and red. This would have been an attractive and sensible option that still aligns with the traditional school colors. Red is a darker color that would show mud and grass stains less readily than white, making it more practical for a sport like rugby. Visual appeal is subjective, but many sports teams worldwide use a combination of dark and bright colors, such as navy and red, to create a striking and identifiable uniform. The combination of navy jerseys, red shorts, and navy socks with red accents, for example, would make for a pleasing outfit that’s practical for muddy conditions and loyal to the school’s colors. In fiction, especially in school stories like those written by Enid Blyton, the uniforms typically represented the institution's colors, but they were rarely described in great detail, allowing readers to imagine them. The priority in these stories was usually on the spirit of the game and the characters' experiences rather than the specifics of their attire."},{"instruction":"Please write a fun, interesting description of what the Malory Towers players looked like at half time.

Alicia was scarcely recognizable, her hair now a wild cascade of mud-caked locks, her navy jersey bearing the illustrious badge barely visible under the layers of grime. Each girl sported their own unique pattern of muck and earth; Darrell sported an unintentional half-face of mud like a warrior’s paint, while Irene had somehow managed to get more mud on her back than her front. Sally's once-white shorts were now a patchwork of browns and greens, telling the tale of her numerous encounters with the turf. The once-crisp lines of their socks now meandered like muddy rivers down their legs, and their boots were all but indistinguishable from the squelching earth they had just left. Some players, such as Mary-Lou, seemed slightly less besmirched, having played positions that kept them out of the muddiest scuffles. Yet no girl had escaped completely; they all shared the triumphant glow of those who had truly given their all on the field, their faces lit with a fierce joy only such a romp through the mud could bestow. Even at rest, there was a kinetic energy about them, a readiness to leap back into the fray at a moment's notice. **Guidance for an Illustrator:** **Key Elements:** - Heavy, caked-on mud covering the majority of the jerseys, with the Malory Towers badge partially obscured but still identifiable on each player's chest. - Variation in the amount of mud: Some players, like Alicia, would be virtually head-to-toe covered in mud, reflecting frequent tackles and dives, while others, like Mary-Lou, would have less coverage, suggesting roles with less ground contact. - Heterogeneous patterns of mud: Emphasize that each player has a unique pattern, such as Darrell with a more concentrated amount of mud on one side of her face, resembling war paint. - Dark mud stains on shorts, possibly with small spots of white still visible in protected areas such as creases or folds. - Socks streaked with mud in downward rivulets, but school colors (likely navy and red) should still be somewhat discernible despite the muck. - Boots thickly coated in mud, to the extent that their original color is almost completely obscured. - Hair of various lengths matted with mud, some faces might be mostly clean but with splashes, particularly around the hairline and jaw from wiping mud away. - Expressions convey eagerness and satisfaction, capturing the spirit of camaraderie and delight in the game despite the messy conditions. **Background Context:** - Players are on the sidelines of a very muddy rugby pitch, some may be seated on benches, while others stand or stretch. - Water bottles, towels, and perhaps a coach or two should be visible in the background. - The atmosphere should suggest a brief respite and team strategy discussion, with a focus on the camaraderie and cheerful resilience of the team."},{"instruction":"That is good, thank you.

From head to toe, they were daubed with the battlefield's palette: the rich, dark brown of wet earth clung to every limb. Not one pair of legs escaped the splattery embrace of the pitch, each streaked with mud that clung stubbornly despite the drizzle that had begun to fall. It wasn't just their kits that bore the battle scars of the first half. Strong arms, used to tackling and propping up teammates, were smeared with layers of muck, their natural skin tones peeking through in a few untouched places. Droplets of mud adorned their cheeks and chins where they had wiped at their faces with grimy hands, unknowingly painting themselves with the mire of vigorous play. The physical exertion had sculpted their bodies with the wet earth; a forearm here outlined in mud, a calf there streaked with the mark of a slide. The muscle and movement beneath were accentuated by the lines of grime, as if their very strength and vitality were highlighted by the game’s muddied touch. **Guidance for an Illustrator:** **Body Details:** - Depict a variety of body types, all athletic and exhibiting the physical exertion of the match. - Highlight areas of muscle definition—such as biceps, forearms, thighs, and calves—with mud streaks to emphasize the physique particular to rugby players. For instance, the bulge of a bicep might have a sheen of mud outlining it, while the sides of a calf could show darker smears from a recent fall. - Illustrate smudges and splashes of mud on necks and bare arms, with some players potentially having large handprints where they've either caught a muddy ball or pushed themselves up from the ground. - Hands should be muddy on the palms and fingers, possibly with mud under the nails, signifying their extensive contact with the ball and ground. - Include details to suggest movement: one player might be wiping her brow, leaving a smear, while another could be flexing her hands to shake off excess mud. **Pose and Attire:** - Show a dynamic range of postures: some girls stretching legs or backs, some sitting and leaning forward with elbows on muddy knees, revealing the defined muscles and the caked mud on their skin. - Players' shorts should cling to them, dampened by the mud and sweat, and revealing the power in their rugby-trained legs. - Avoid uniformity in mud application—let some players have heavier mud coverage on their legs if they've been more involved in scrums or tackles. **Facial Expressions and Interaction:** - Faces should reflect a blend of fatigue, determination, and jubilance. Some girls might have furrowed brows, others wide grins despite the grime. - Perhaps one or two girls are laughing or joking, pointing at their own muddied state or a teammate's particularly artistic coverage. - Provide details like one player calmly peeling off a caked mud glove from her hand or another looking in mock despair at the state of her once-visible skin. Remember to balance the illustration with the overall energy of a break in a rigorous game – the girls should appear vigorous and very much in their element, despite the layers of mud, ready to tackle the second half with as much gusto as the first."},{"instruction":"Please write an exciting, realistic story about a rugby match between Malory Towers and St Clare’s in the style of Enid Blyton’s early school stories.

The grounds of Malory Towers lay heavy and saturated, the kind of mud-spattered earth that makes every Rugby player's heart beat with an odd mixture of dread and excitement. \\"Oh, it's going to be a proper slog today,\\" said Darrell Rivers, the stalwart captain of the Malory Towers Rugby team, as she looked out at the field where they were to meet their old rivals from St Clare's. The girls around her nodded, some with grim determination, others with grins that betrayed their love for the rough and tumble of a muddy match. \\"I say, if we keep the ball in the thickest patches, we'll sap their energy faster than ours,\\" Darrell suggested with a sly glance at her fellow teammates, each of them sturdy and robust from their morning swims and the hearty walks they often took around the cliffs. \\"We're used to the tough Cornish terrain. They aren't.\\" The team murmured their agreement, pulling on their jerseys with pride. They were a vivid crimson against the drab day, strong and fearless. The whistle blew, and the match commenced with all the ferocity expected from an old school rivalry. The girls from Malory Towers took to the field with an energy that was almost palpable, caking their boots and knees in gumboots of mud within minutes. Sally Hope, the quickest on the team, made an early break, her feet skidding in the soft earth as she dodged a St Clare's tackle. The crowd, a sea of umbrellas and raincoats, erupted in cheers. But the girls from St Clare's were no slouches; they had come all this way and weren't going to let Malory Towers walk all over them. They fought back valiantly, pushing the home team hard, causing a fumble here, a mishandle there. The ball was slippery, a hen’s egg eluding grasp after grasp. \\"Form up! Scrum down!\\" Darrell called, and her teammates moved into position with practiced ease, though their boots were now more slick with mud than leather. They leaned in, faces inches from the muck, and with a heave their shoulders collided with those of their adversaries. Then, with a sudden darting maneuver, Irene from Malory's side, known more for her music than her sport, surprised everyone by snaffling the oval ball from the scrum's unravel and hared down the pitch. The crowd was on their feet, shouting, as Irene sidestepped a tackle with the grace of a ballerina. But a St Clare’s forward was closing in, her face set and eyes alight with competitive fire. With a desperate lunge, the St Clare's forward tackled Irene just meters from the try line, both girls sliding through the mire like seals returning to the sea. The Malory supporters groaned in sympathy, hands raking hair, wishing suddenly that they could jump into the tow themselves. Such passion these school matches did stir! A ruck formed, both teams grappling for the ball. It was Alicia Johns, with her characteristic mirth even in the heat of battle, who emerged from the ruck with the ball, and with a cheeky wink to the St Clare’s scrum-half, off she sprinted. \\"Go Alicia!\\" the Malory crowd shouted, getting louder and rowdier than ever. Alicia charged for the final stretch, the St Clare’s full-back hot on her heels, her breath visible in the cold air. But luck and mud were on Alicia's side; her tackler slipped in a particularly squishy patch, and Alicia plopped the ball down for a glorious try. From the sidelines, Mary-Lou clapped her hands so hard together they turned red, her admiration for her friends shining in her eyes despite the dreary clouds. Converting the try in this muck was going to be a real challenge, but Darrell stood up to the plate, eyeing the posts with the calm focus of a general. She took her mark, gritted her teeth, and with a swift kick, sent the muddy ball flying. It sailed between the posts with inches to spare. Success! As the match continued, it became clear that the Malory Towers girls' plan was working. The match was a test of endurance, and the heavy ground was taking its toll on St Clare's. Malory Towers kept the play in the worst of the mud, working like a machine, each cog—each girl—knowing her job and doing it. The final whistle rang through the damp air, with Malory Towers narrowly in the lead. The girls lined up to shake the hands of their bowed but proud opponents from St Clare’s. They had triumphant grins stained with mud, and their hair was plastered to their foreheads, but nothing shone brighter than their eyes, alight with the thrill of victory and the simple joy of a game well played. And as they walked back to the tower, with the fading shouts of their supporters in their ears, they knew they’d remember this muddy match against St Clare's for years to come. It was more than just a game; it was Malory Towers spirit made manifest, one mucky ruck at a time."},{"instruction":"What exactly was involved when Alicia plopped the ball down for a try? Did she have so much time that she could ground the ball calmly by bending down? Or did she dive or let herself fall to the ground to ground the ball as quickly as possible?","output":"The pitch was a quagmire, and the play had been fast and frenetic. When Alicia emerged with the ball from the ruck, poised to dash for the try line, the cheer from the Malory Towers supporters rose in hope and anticipation. St Clare's, though weary from the constant battle against both their opponents and the sucking mud, were quick to give chase. The full-back, a sprightly girl with a reputation for last-minute tackles, was hot on Alicia's heels, closing in with every determined stride. As Alicia approached the try line, her breath creating puffs of white against the grey day, the air was thick with suspense. She could hear the sound of her pursuer's feet squelching in the mud and knew she had no time to waste. There was just a sliver of a gap between them, the St Clare's girl a looming shadow just a hair's breadth away. With the line just a meter in front, and the tackle imminent, Alicia made a split-second decision. She couldn't risk standing up to place the ball down calmly or bending over which might invite a tackle and a potential knock-on. No, she would have to ground the ball as swiftly as possible. Eyes wide and heart thudding, Alicia launched herself forward in a dive, her outstretched arms holding the ball securely against her chest. It was a move born of necessity, athleticism, and sheer instinct. She hit the ground, the impact lessened by the sludge, and slid along, the momentum carrying her over the line. There was a resounding squelch as Alicia's body met the mire, ensuring the ball was grounded firmly beneath her. It wasn't the most graceful of falls, but there was no denying the effectiveness – the ball was down, the try was scored, and the whistle blew to confirm it. Pulling herself up from the mud, Alicia raised her arms in triumph, her teammates rushing to celebrate with her, whooping and cheering as the mud-splattered crowd roared their approval."},{"instruction":"The story is going to have several four illustrations of Alicia, showing her appearance changing as the match goes on.

A steady drizzle the night before had ensured that the field was a challenge for any player daring enough to step onto it. Nonetheless, the girls of Malory Towers were a hearty bunch, and they looked forward to the impending match against their friendly rivals from St Clare's with a mix of enthusiasm and determination. Darrell Rivers, the intrepid captain of the Malory Towers rugby team, rallied her teammates with a grin that was as infectious as it was spirited. She knew that St Clare's would be tough opponents, but given the conditions of the pitch, she had a plan that might just tilt the scales in their favor. \\"Look here,\\" Darrell called out with the commanding voice that had won her the captaincy. \\"We know this pitch and its muddy tricks better than anyone. More than that, we relish the tussle with the earth as much as with our opponents!\\" Her teammates cheered in approval, muddy smears already decorating their kits from their warm-up. The whistle blew, and the match began with a crunch of bodies and a spray of mud. The ball was slippery, like a giant wet soap, and handling it was like trying to catch a fish with bare hands. St Clare's managed to secure the ball first, their fly-half darting through with nimble footwork. But the Malory Towers girls were no slouches. Alicia Johns, quick as a flash, managed a low tackle that sent both girls sliding across the field in a chaotic tumble. The ball squirted free, allowing Irene to scoop it up and pass it on to the intrepid Sally Hope. Sally charged forward, her boots squelching heavily in the mud, the weight of it pulling her down but her resolve lifting her spirits. The game was a maelstrom of motion, as both teams fought tooth and nail for every inch of ground. The St Clare's girls were indeed adept with the ball and quick with their feet, but they hadn't counted on the mud being an adversary as formidable as the Malory Towers team. \\"It's like wading through treacle!\\" gasped one St Clare's girl, as she tried to break through the Malory defense. \\"Use the mud!\\" Darrell yelled to her teammates, and they understood instantly. Each time St Clare's neared the drier patches of turf, the Malory girls steered them back into the morass, tiring the visitors and regaining control of the game. A particularly fierce ruck erupted near the St Clare's try-line. The ball emerged on the Malory side, and before the St Clare's girls could regroup, Darrell had snapped it up and dove for the line, landing with a splat that sent mud flying high into the air. \\"Try for Malory Towers!\\" The ref's voice cut through the cheers of the crowd as Darrell emerged, beaming, her face streaked with the muddy badge of honor. Mary-Lou, usually so timid, stepped up for the conversion, her eyes squinting in concentration. With a precise kick, she launched the ball between the posts despite the drag of the mud on her boot, adding the extra points. With each scrum, it was clear that the St Clare's girls were flagging, their energy sapped by both the relentless opponents and the energy-sucking mud. Malory Towers pressed this advantage, showing a unity and vigor in their forward packs and a surprising agility in their backs, given the terrain. The game reached its final minutes with Malory Towers maintaining a slender lead. St Clare's mounted one last attack, their desperation lending them a burst of energy. They edged towards the try-line, but an astounding tackle by June Johns saved the day just as the whistle blew for full-time. The Malory Towers girls erupted with joy, muddy arms thrown around each other, their camaraderie shining through the grime. They had won, not just through their skill and strength, but through strategy and an indomitable spirit that not even a sea of mud could quench. Slipping and sliding their way back to the changing rooms, laughter bubbled among the team. Draped in their victory and cloaked in mud, they never felt more at home than on the rugby field with their teammates.

Center on the team captain, a determined teenage girl with brown hair, raising her hand enthusiastically while addressing her teammates. Ensure the team is wearing ruby red and gold rugby kits, which are splattered with mud. Show each player's visible excitement, focus, and camaraderie, and include a muddy pitch underfoot with rugby boots half-submerged in thick, brown mud. Negative Prompt: - Avoid adult characters or male players, as this is a girls' school rugby team. Do not depict a clean and dry environment, as the setting should be muddy and wet to reflect the story's atmosphere. Exclude bright and sunny skies, as the scene should convey anticipation before a match rather than a concluded event. **Illustration 2: The Determination in the Tackle** Positive Prompt: - Illustrate an action-packed moment featuring two teenage girls mid-tackle on a muddy rugby field. The attacker from the opposing team should appear surprised, with a muddy ball in hand, and the defender should look extremely determined with her eyes set on her target. Capture the muddy spray in an arc around them, with detailed stains and marks on their rugby kits, arms, and legs. Negative Prompt: - Do not show any harmful or violent imagery; keep the tackle within the bounds of sporty playfulness and athleticism. Refrain from including background distractions, keeping the focus on the two central players in action. Do not create a clean and pristine uniform or field, as the illustration should emphasize mud and the harsh condition of the playing field. **Illustration 3: The Mid-Game Battle** Positive Prompt: - Artfully capture the chaos of a muddy ruck with multiple teenage girls from two different rugby teams entangled in a fierce competition for a ball on an extremely muddy field. The players' kits should be darkened from the mud, with energy and concentration etched on their faces. The central character, identifiable by her particular jersey number, reaches out amidst the struggle, with her expression a mixture of intensity and determination. Negative Prompt: - Avoid a static or orderly scene; the image needs to convey intense motion and struggle. Do not depict clean, visible jersey colors as the players should be caked with mud and barely distinguishable from the muddy ground. Eliminate any sense of tranquility or clarity and instead focus on the messy, gritty nature of the ruck. **Illustration 4: The Soggy Triumph** Positive Prompt: - Illustrate a triumphant teenage girl as she dives face-first into the mud, streaking it across her cheeks while grounding a rugby ball at a try-line. Her face should beam with happiness and success, despite being covered in mud, with a background of exuberant, cheering crowd figures. Ensure to depict her teammates rushing toward her, all equally muddy and ecstatic, against a backdrop of a gloomy sky. Negative Prompt: - Do not portray feelings of defeat or calm, as this is a moment of victory. Avoid depicting clean uniforms and clear skies; the game conditions are exceedingly muddy and overcast. Exclude solitary or peaceful expressions; the atmosphere should be one of collective and frenetic celebration. **Illustration 5: The Final Whistle** Positive Prompt: - Visualize a joyful group of teenage rugby players celebrating the end of a muddy match, with each completely coated in mud except for the kicker, whose face is still relatively clean. Focus on the kicker as she executes a pivotal kick, ball mid-air, symbolizing a key moment against a dark and heavy sky. Surround her with her teammates, their faces are uplifting, muddy, and expressive of victory, as they cheer and raise their fists. Negative Prompt: - Do not show a sense of defeat, sadness, or pristine conditions. This is a celebratory scene that should be filled with expressions of joy and victory despite, or because of, the adversity presented by the mud. Avoid making the scene look too clean or orderly, as the celebration is raucous and wild."},{"instruction":"Can you please clarify the (clean) appearance of the team kit? What color are the shirts, shorts and socks? Are they solid color or patterned?","output":"Certainly! Let's imagine a classic and clean appearance for the Malory Towers rugby team kit, adhering to a design that would befit a traditional school team: Shirts: The rugby shirts are primarily a deep ruby red color, which symbolizes the school's colors. The shirts are solid in color, but feature broad horizontal gold bands around the midriff and cuffs, adding a contrasting yet harmonious detail to the design. The school crest is embroidered on the left chest, proudly displaying the school's emblem. Shorts: Complementing the shirts, the shorts are a solid, clean white providing a stark contrast to the ruby red shirts. This makes the players' upper halves stand out on the field. The shorts are practical and robust, designed to withstand the tough tackles and muddy conditions of a rugby match. Socks: The socks mirror the color scheme of the shirts - they are mostly the same ruby red, with one or two gold bands at the top, just below the knee. The socks rise high and are designed to be pulled up to the knee, offering additional support and contributing to the overall athletic aesthetic of the kit. Before the game and the ensuing muddy conditions, the Malory Towers rugby team's kit stands out sharply against the green of a well-tended rugby pitch. However, as we know from the story, they don't stay clean for long once the match begins in the muddy conditions."},{"instruction":"No ChatGPT o Que É Temperatura E Top-p Núcleos Sampling","output":"No contexto de modelos de linguagem como o ChatGPT, que sou baseado, \\"temperatura\\" e \\"top-p núcleos sampling\\" (também conhecido como \\"nucleus sampling\\") são métodos usados para gerar texto de maneira mais diversificada e imprevisível. 1. Temperatura: A temperatura é um hiperparâmetro que afeta a aleatoriedade das previsões geradas pelo modelo. Quando você ajusta a temperatura, está basicamente ajustando a probabilidade de distribuição das palavras que serão geradas. Uma temperatura mais alta resulta em maior diversidade e criatividade, pois o modelo tem mais probabilidade de escolher palavras menos prováveis, levando a resultados potencialmente mais surpreendentes ou inusitados. Por outro lado, uma temperatura baixa faz com que o modelo favoreça as palavras mais prováveis, resultando em texto mais previsível e conservador. Com uma temperatura de zero, o modelo sempre escolherá a palavra mais provável a seguir. 2. Top-p (nucleus sampling): O nucleus sampling é uma alternativa ao método de amostragem clássico, que é muitas vezes chamado de top-k sampling, onde \\"k\\" é o número de possíveis próximas palavras que o modelo considerará. Em vez de selecionar as \\"k\\" palavras mais prováveis, o nucleus sampling seleciona a partir de um conjunto dinâmico de palavras que têm uma probabilidade cumulativa \\"p\\". Basicamente, ele olha para a lista de palavras possíveis, classificadas por sua probabilidade, e soma essas probabilidades até que o total alcance o valor \\"p\\" (um número entre 0 e 1). A partir daí, uma palavra é selecionada aleatoriamente desse subconjunto de palavras. Isso permite que o modelo gere texto que é ao mesmo tempo surpreendente e contextualmente coerente, mantendo-se dentro de um determinado \\"núcleo\\" de opções plausíveis. Ambos os métodos são maneiras de trazer equilíbrio entre aleatoriedade e previsibilidade para a geração de texto pelos modelos de linguagem. Esses métodos são importantes especialmente em aplicações criativas, como a escrita de histórias ou a geração de ideias, onde você deseja que o modelo tenha a capacidade de surpreender e inovar, em vez de apenas seguir padrões linguísticos comuns."},{"instruction":"Seja muitíssimo simples","output":"Desculpe pela complexidade anterior.

A habilidade de voo do Titã Mandíbula de Falco é uma ocorrência única e não é uma característica típica do Titã Mandíbula. A razão pela qual o Titã Mandíbula de Falco pode voar está relacionada a uma combinação de fatores específicos do enredo: 1. **Injeção de Zeke**: Antes de se tornar um Titã, Falco foi injetado com o fluido espinhal de Zeke Yeager, que é o portador do Titã Fera. O Titã Fera de Zeke tem características únicas devido à sua linhagem real e à sua própria natureza como um Titã. 2. **Memórias e Vontade**: No universo de \\"Shingeki no Kyojin\\", as memórias e a vontade dos Titãs anteriores podem influenciar os novos portadores. Acredita-se que a combinação do fluido espinhal de Zeke e as circunstâncias únicas de Falco permitiram que ele acessasse uma habilidade latente ou mutação que resultou na capacidade de voo. 3. **Narrativa e Simbolismo**: Do ponto de vista da narrativa, a habilidade de voo do Titã Mandíbula de Falco serve a propósitos específicos na história, oferecendo novas dinâmicas de batalha e simbolizando a esperança e a liberdade em um mundo cheio de desespero e restrições. A habilidade de voo de Falco é, portanto, uma exceção e não uma regra para os portadores do Titã Mandíbula. É um exemplo de como os poderes dos Titãs em \\"Shingeki no Kyojin\\" podem variar e evoluir de maneiras inesperadas, dependendo de uma série de fatores únicos dentro do universo da série."},{"instruction":"SHINGEKI NO KYOJIN:Por Q","output":"Parece que su pregunta sobre \\"Shingeki no Kyojin\\" (también conocido como \\"Attack on Titan\\") no está completa.

Eren posee la habilidad de transformarse en un Titán, y junto con sus amigos se unen al ejército para luchar contra los Titanes. A medida que avanza la historia, se revelan secretos sobre la naturaleza de los Titanes, el origen de la habilidad de Eren y la historia de su mundo. El manga y el anime son conocidos por su narrativa intensa, giros argumentales y representación gráfica de la lucha por la supervivencia de la humanidad contra una amenaza descomunal, así como por su crítica social y sus múltiples capas de misterio.

Falco Grice, que herda o poder do Titã Mandíbula, eventualmente desenvolve a capacidade de voar, algo que nenhum outro portador do Mandíbula exibiu antes. Essa habilidade inédita é explicada pelo enredo da história e envolve alguns fatores-chave: 1. **Influência do Titã Fera:** Falco ganhou a habilidade de voar devido à ingestão acidental do fluido espinhal do Titã Fera de Zeke Yeager. Antes de se tornar um Titã, Falco foi uma das vítimas de Zeke durante a batalha em Shiganshina, onde Zeke transformou Eldianos em Titãs usando seu fluido espinhal. Quando Falco foi transformado em um Titã Puro, ele já havia ingerido esse fluido, o que alterou sua biologia. 2. **Aspecto Genético:** Existem linhas genéticas entre os Titãs que podem expressar características únicas, sugerindo que a linhagem do Titã Fera de Zeke poderia ter algum tipo de conexão ancestral com animais voadores, o que influenciou a manifestação dessa habilidade inusitada em Falco após ele se tornar o portador do Titã Mandíbula. 3. **Mutação ou Evolução:** A série também explora temas de mutação e evolução. A repentina capacidade de voo de Falco pode ser interpretada como uma mutação causada pela combinação de fluidos espinhais distintos, ou até mesmo uma evolução das capacidades inherentes do Titã Mandíbula, desencadeada pelas circunstâncias únicas do seu caso. 4. **Narrativa e Simbolismo:** Do ponto de vista da narrativa, a capacidade de Falco voar adiciona um novo elemento dinâmico ao enredo, e também ressoa com o tema recorrente de liberdade que percorre toda a série. Os Titãs, que anteriormente estavam confinados a andar ou correr no solo, agora têm a habilidade de ir além, voando pelos céus, o que pode ser visto como um símbolo de superação de limites e alcançar a liberdade através de meios inesperados. Vale ressaltar que, como \\"Shingeki no Kyojin\\" é uma obra de ficção com elementos sobrenaturais, nem todas as explicações têm base em lógica científica real do nosso mundo; muitas vezes, elas se encaixam na lógica interna criada pelo autor Hajime Isayama para a história. Assim, algumas das peculiaridades sobre os Titãs e suas habilidades são explicadas dentro do contexto fictício da série e contribuem para a riqueza e unicidade do universo de \\"Attack on Titan\\"."},{"instruction":"SHINGEKI NO KYOJIN:Por Q o Titã do Falco Grice voa","output":"Em \\"Shingeki no Kyojin\\" ou \\"Attack on Titan\\", o personagem Falco Grice ganha a habilidade de voar em sua forma de Titã devido a uma circunstância única relacionada à sua herança de poderes de Titã. **Alerta de Spoiler para quem não acompanhou até as temporadas finais:** Falco faz parte dos Guerreiros, um grupo de Eldianos treinados pela Nação de Marley para herdar os poderes dos Nove Titãs Originais. Ele consegue o poder do Titã Mandíbula, que originalmente pertencia a Porco Galliard, depois de Galliard ser fatalmente ferido durante uma batalha. Falco, contudo, foi previamente injetado com o fluido espinhal de Zeke Jaeger, o Portador do Titã Bestial, para ser usado na estratégia de Marley de transformar Eldianos em Titãs irracionais controlados por Zeke. Devido a essa exposição ao fluido espinhal do Titã Bestial, que teoricamente poderia representar algum tipo de traço genético ou habilidade do Titã, Falco acaba adquirindo uma forma única de Titã Mandíbula que possui características aviárias, incluindo asas, permitindo-lhe voar. Isso é uma exceção aos típicos Titãs Mandíbula, que não têm essa capacidade. Esse desenvolvimento não foi apenas uma surpresa para os personagens, mas também para os leitores e espectadores, pois introduziu um novo aspecto das habilidades dos Titãs que não havia sido explorado anteriormente na história. A habilidade de Falco voar se torna crucial para a estratégia dos personagens principais na luta final contra os Marleyanos e na tentativa de deter Eren Jaeger e sua marcha dos Colossais."},{"instruction":"SHINGEKI NO KYOJIN: COMO E POR QUE A MIKASA ERA A PESSOA WUE QUE LIBERTARIA YMIR FRITZ","output":"\\"Shingeki no Kyojin\\" (Attack on Titan) é uma série de mangá escrita e ilustrada por Hajime Isayama que também foi adaptada para um anime de enorme sucesso. A história gira em torno de Eren Jaeger e seus amigos Mikasa Ackerman e Armin Arlert, que vivem em um mundo onde a humanidade reside dentro de enormes muralhas para se proteger dos Titãs, criaturas gigantes que comem humanos. Ao longo da série, é revelado que a progenitora de todos os Titãs é Ymir Fritz, uma figura histórica lendária que viveu há cerca de 2.000 anos antes dos eventos principais da série e que fez um pacto com o \\"Diabo da Terra\\" recebendo o poder dos Titãs. Este poder foi dividido em nove Titãs com habilidades especiais, que passaram de pessoa para pessoa através dos séculos. Na mitologia da série, Ymir é mostrada como uma escrava e uma pessoa atormentada, tanto em vida quanto após a sua morte, onde foi condenada a servir seus descendentes no \\"Caminho\\" (uma dimensão onde o tempo é irrelevante e onde todas as almas dos Eldianos estão conectadas) por toda a eternidade. O papel de Mikasa na libertação de Ymir Fritz é um aspecto crucial e simbólico no clímax da série. Mikasa era próxima de Eren Jaeger, que ao longo da série, acaba herdando o poder do Titã Fundador, que originalmente pertencia a Ymir. Eren usa esse poder para iniciar o \\"Rumbling\\", um evento catastrófico no qual os Colossais Titãs que compõem as muralhas são liberados para destruir o mundo além da ilha de Paradis como forma de proteger sua gente dos inimigos externos. Por que Mikasa era a pessoa que libertaria Ymir? Isso é em parte porque Mikasa toma uma decisão extremamente difícil que representa a liberdade das amarras do amor e do destino. Ymir se identifica com Mikasa por causa do amor que ambas têm (Ymir por seu rei Fritz, e Mikasa por Eren) — um amor que muitas vezes as levou a fazer sacrifícios pessoais significativos. Em um momento crucial, Mikasa escolhe matar Eren, mostrando assim sua força para superar seu próprio coração e escolher o que ela acredita ser o caminho certo, mesmo que isso signifique uma enorme perda pessoal. Através deste ato, Ymir percebe que também pode se libertar de seu amor cego e da escravidão eterna, finalizando o ciclo de reencarnação dos Titãs. Sua libertação simboliza o fim do poder dos Titãs e a possibilidade de um novo começo para a humanidade. Portanto, a libertação de Ymir Fritz por Mikasa não é uma questão técnica ou mágica, mas sim um ato que tem muito a ver com superação pessoal, a quebra de grilhões emocionais e o poder dos indivíduos de fazerem escolhas que podem mudar o curso da história, temas centrais em \\"Shingeki no Kyojin\\"."},{"instruction":"Seja mais curto e simples","output":"Mikasa era a pessoa que libertaria Ymir Fritz porque, no clímax de \\"Shingeki no Kyojin\\", ela supera seu amor por Eren ao tomar a difícil decisão de matá-lo para impedir seus planos destrutivos. Esta escolha mostra que Mikasa pode escolher o caminho certo acima de seus próprios sentimentos. Através desse ato corajoso, Ymir Fritz, que estava presa em um ciclo de servidão devido ao seu próprio amor pelo rei Fritz, se identifica com o sacrifício de Mikasa e encontra a força para se libertar de suas próprias correntes emocionais. Esse ato simboliza a liberdade de escolha e o fim do ciclo dos Titãs."},{"instruction":"Please write an exciting, realistic story about a rugby match between Malory Towers and St Clare’s in the style of Enid Blyton’s early school stories. At both schools the main winter sport is rugby and the girls are all keen players. Write as if Malory Towers is the focus of our story. It is very muddy but none of the girls mind - they love getting to roll around in the mud. The match is close fought. Include some exciting, dramatic descriptions of key events in the match - tackles (successful or otherwise), rucks, mauls, tries, conversions - whatever you think will add to the fun and drama of the story.","output":"The piercing whistle sounded as the two teams huddled together, their breath streaming like dragon smoke in the nippy air. The fields of Malory Towers had donned a cloak of mud—a result of the recent rains—that would now serve as the battleground for the fierce competition between Malory Towers and their arch-rivals, St Clare's. Not a soul at Malory Towers was unexcited about the match that afternoon. The anticipation had been brewing ever since the fixture was announced, and a restless energy hung about the school like the last note of a song. Felicity, the captain of Malory Towers' team, stood with her teammates, her face smeared with mud; her eyes, fierce and determined. \\"Alright, girls,\\" Felicity urged with confidence that only a captain could muster, \\"let's play hard, play fair, and show St Clare's what Malory Towers' spirit truly means.\\" The Malory Towers girls shouted their assent, a rousing cheer that echoed across the field and was answered by the determined faces of the St Clare's team lined up opposite them. The match began with a kick-off from Malory Towers that sliced through the cold air, arcing towards the muddied battlefield. The St Clare's girls caught it deftly, charging back in a solid formation. The first tackles were ferocious; arms and legs entangled as girl after girl fought to gain possession of the oval ball. Alicia, Malory Towers' quickest player, darted through a gap in the line like an eel slipping through rocks. She evaded two tackles, her boots splattering mud in all directions. But just as she was within a hair's breadth of the try-line, a St Clare's girl wrapped her arms around Alicia's waist and down they both went in a tumble that send shockwaves of cheer through both teams’ supporters. From the muddy scrum that ensued, Irene, the scrappiest forward on the team, managed to wrestle the ball free and passed it out to the waiting hands of Janet. The slippery sphere was nearly squandered, but Janet, with a display of surprising agility, caught it against her chest and charged towards the try line. The St Clare's girls swarmed her like a flock of starlings turning in flight, but Janet's determination was unwavering. She reached out just as she was brought to the ground, scoring the first try for Malory Towers, her fingers brushing the chalky line. The conversion was taken by Darrell, her eyes set, brow furrowed in concentration. The ball soared between the posts with an authority that raised another triumphant roar from the Malory Towers supporters. The team beamed with pride, their lead now 7-0. St Clare's did not let this dampen their spirits. In retaliation, they charged back with a ferocity that saw them making ground into Malory Towers' half. A maul formed, a wall of bodies pushing and heaving under the intricate rules of rugby. Back and forth the battle raged, as neither team was willing to yield an inch without a fierce contest. Amid grunts and cries, another darting run by a St Clare’s wing was thumped into the mud by a colossal tackle from Malory Towers' vice-captain, Sally, whose determination in defense was as admirable as it was fearsome. However, the tenacity of St Clare's paid off. A moment of quick thinking led to a cleverly executed side step, and in slipped a lean figure from St Clare’s, avoiding tackle after tackle to answer with a try. The conversion curved wide in the muddied wind, leaving the score a biting close 7-5. The final minutes stretched like an unending saga, with St Clare’s scoring another unconverted try, putting them ahead 10-7. The Malory girls, muddied and panting, faced the final moments with unshakable resolve. It was now or never. In the last play, as if from the pages of an epic, Darrell broke through St Clare's defensive line, jinking and swerving, her eyes set on the prize. She twisted past the last defender, lunged, and grounded the ball with mere seconds left on the clock. Cheers erupted from both the onlookers and the players of Malory Towers, muffled by the muck but bright as day in their hearts. The conversion, in the hands of Darrell once more, decided the fate of the game. With the same concentration as before, she became deaf to the suspense around her. She struck—and the ball sailed true. 12-10 to Malory Towers! As the final whistle signaled the end of the muddy skirmish, the girls of Malory Towers jubilantly embraced each other, laughter and triumph painted on their faces as vividly as the mud. The St Clare’s girls too, downhearted but sportsmanlike, came over to congratulate them. \\"What a match, eh?\\" Felicity beamed, shaking hands with the St Clare's captain. \\"One for the school annals.\\" \\"There'll be a next time,\\" promised the St Clare's captain, with a grin that revealed no trace of her disappointment. The spirits of Malory Towers couldn't have been higher as the girls made their way to the showers, leaving a battlefield of memories behind them, their hearts as warm as the roaring fire awaited them in the common room. They had won, and done so playing the game they loved, through mud and mirth alike, as any true Malory Towers girl would."},{"instruction":"The story is going to have four or five illustrations.

Alicia, grinning from ear to ear as she wrestled with her rugby boots, turned to Irene. \\"That tackle must have sent you halfway to China, Irene!\\" she jested. Irene, who was trying with all her might to scrub the mud off her elbows, retorted with a laugh, \\"Well, if it did, I'd make sure to send you a postcard—or at least what's left of me after that maul!\\" Sally dropped her now unrecognizable socks onto the floor with a wet plop and boasted, “I reckon those St Clare’s girls will think twice before challenging our wing again. Did you see her face when you popped out of nowhere, Janet?” Janet chuckled, finally free of her boots, “More like popped out of the mud, I’d say. I was practically a mole the way I had to tunnel through them!” “Darrell’s last-minute try was a sight, though,” Felicity chimed in, wiping a streak of mud from her face with a towel that was just as grimy. “Straight through their defenses like a knife through butter!” Darrell laughed modestly, “More like a hippo through the reeds with all that mud. I felt like I was wading, not running!” Amidst their banter, the girls cleaned up as best they could and changed into fresh clothes for the light meal with the St Clare's team. They troted down to the common room where tables had been pushed together and adorned with platters of sandwiches, biscuits, cakes, and jugs of lemonade. The St Clare's girls, also freshened up and free of the earlier battle’s grime, were already there. As the Malory Towers' team entered, a cheer went up from both teams, a salute to the camaraderie between them. \\"Here come the mud warriors of Malory Towers!\\" called out the St Clare's captain, her voice laced with humor. \\"Only the finest mud for us,\\" Felicity responded with a grin, \\"We thought we’d bring some of the field with us as souvenirs.\\" The girls laughed, gathering around the food, their spirits still high, tucking into the sandwiches and cakes with gusto. The conversation flowed easily, filled with lighthearted teasing. \\"I still can't believe you managed to fish that ball from the bottom of the ruck,\\" a St Clare's vice-captain said to Irene, shaking her head in amazement. \\"It’s all about having the right bait!\\" Irene quipped, and the girls around her erupted with laughter. \\"And what about that conversion kick,\\"said a St. Clare's forward, nodding towards Darrell, \\"Through the wind and mud—the stuff of legends!\\" Darrell shrugged with a smile, \\"Nothing that a bath and a cake can't cure!\\" As the evening wore on, the initial rivalry gave way to a warm, sportsmanlike atmosphere. Stories were shared, and respect grew between the teams. They were rivals on the field, but off it, they were united by their love of the game—and today, by their adventures in the mud. As the light outside began to dim, and the common room became alight with the golden glow of lamps, the girls from both schools knew they had built memories that would last a lifetime. They parted with promises of rematches and jokes of who would host the next 'mud-fest', as they now fondly called the day. The Malory Towers team watched their opponents leave before clearing up the common room, their hearts full of triumph and newfound friendships."},{"instruction":"Copia del título archivado Nro. 2012-00687623 de la partida electrónica 03016138 del Registro de Personas Jurídicas de Lima correspondiente a la inscripción de los partes notariales relativos a los siguientes documentos: a) Escritura pública Nro. 402, de fecha 26 de julio de 2012 - Kardex 30046 del Notario Público Walter Ramón Pinedo Orillo, sobre adecuación a la Ley General de Sociedades que otorga Grupo Overseas S.A.

Em \\"Shingeki no Kyojin\\" (Ataque dos Titãs), obra criada por Hajime Isayama, encontramos aspectos que são semelhantes à ideia central do paradoxo de Bootstrap, particularmente no uso das memórias e poderes do Titã de Ataque. Um exemplo disso é o conhecimento e as memórias que Eren Jaeger recebe de futuros herdeiros do Titã de Ataque. Essas memórias lhe permitem acessar informações que ainda não ocorreram em sua linha do tempo. Quando Eren utiliza essas informações para tomar decisões no presente, ele, em essência, está influenciando os eventos futuros dos quais ele já possui conhecimento. Esse conhecimento tem origem no futuro, mas é enviado ao passado e usado para moldar os eventos que levarão àquele mesmo futuro, criando um loop causal. Isso gera perguntas como: \\"Como essas memórias começaram?\\" e \\"Se as memórias influenciam o presente para que ocorra um futuro específico, então quem realmente iniciou a cadeia de eventos?\\" Os poderes e eventos associados ao Titã de Ataque nesta narrativa criam uma complexa rede de causa e efeito entre passado, presente e futuro, similar ao que ocorre com o Paradoxo de Bootstrap. Contudo, deve-se ressaltar que \\"Shingeki no Kyojin\\" possui sua própria mitologia e regras, portanto, enquanto a série pode evocar o conceito do Paradoxo de Bootstrap, ela o faz dentro da lógica própria do universo criado por Isayama."},{"instruction":"Como O Paradoxo De Bootstrap Se Relaciona Com Shingeki no kyojin","output":"O paradoxo de Bootstrap, também conhecido como paradoxo da causalidade ou ciclo de tempo fechado, é um conceito teórico frequentemente utilizado em histórias de ficção científica e envolve a ideia de que um objeto ou informação pode existir sem um ponto de origem. Em essência, algo é enviado de volta no tempo e se torna a causa de si mesmo em um ciclo contínuo, sem um começo claro. Em \\"Shingeki no Kyojin\\" (conhecido em inglês como \\"Attack on Titan\\"), o paradoxo de Bootstrap pode ser relacionado à história, mais especificamente ao uso das memórias e poderes dos Titãs. Na narrativa, os indivíduos com a capacidade de se transformar em Titãs têm acesso às memórias de seus antecessores, e essas memórias podem atravessar o tempo, influenciando eventos passados e futuros. Um dos aspectos da história que sugere um ciclo de tempo fechado é a maneira como o protagonista Eren Jaeger recebe informações e influências do futuro. Ele vê visões e tem experiências que parecem transcender sua linha do tempo atual, sugerindo que as ações futuras podem já estar influenciando seu presente ou passado, criando um loop temporal. O poder do Titã de Ataque, que Eren possui, permite que ele veja não apenas as memórias de portadores anteriores, mas também de futuros portadores. Isso significa que ele pode ser influenciado por decisões que ele mesmo tomou no futuro, e essas decisões podem, por sua vez, desencadear os eventos que as levaram a acontecer no primeiro lugar. Essa troca de influência entre passado e futuro sem um ponto de partida ou fim claro se alinha com a ideia do paradoxo de Bootstrap. Outro exemplo claro é quando um personagem recebe um livro com informações vitais de um personagem futuro, que só conseguiu este livro porque no passado havia recebido dele mesmo. \\"Shingeki no Kyojin\\" é complexo e rico em temas de destino, livre arbítrio e o impacto das ações dos personagens através do tempo, o que pode ser interpretado através de uma lente que inclui o paradoxo de Bootstrap. No entanto, a série não se concentra em viajar no tempo no sentido tradicional, mas brinca com a transmissão de memórias e vontades através das gerações de titulares dos Titãs, o que resulta em uma complexa rede de causalidade."},{"instruction":"Como O Paradoxo De Bootstrap Se Relaciona Com Shingeki no kyojin","output":"O Paradoxo de Bootstrap é um conceito teórico geralmente relacionado a histórias envolvendo viagem no tempo. É um loop causal em que um evento é a causa de outro evento, que por sua vez é a causa do primeiro evento. Em outras palavras, algo é trazido à existência através de viagens no tempo para causar sua própria existência, sem um ponto de origem claro. Em \\"Shingeki no Kyojin\\" (Attack on Titan), embora não haja viagem no tempo no sentido tradicional, elementos da narrativa podem flertar com a ideia do paradoxo de bootstrap, especialmente em torno do uso e transferência de memórias e influências através da linhagem dos Titãs. Um dos elementos-chave para entender essa conexão é o poder do Titã de Ataque que permite ao seu possuidor ter vislumbres das memórias de usuários passados e futuros. Essas memórias podem influenciar as ações dos personagens no presente, criando uma linha de eventos que parece pré-destinada, e em alguns casos, esses eventos podem ser considerados como um loop causal. Por exemplo, Eren Jaeger recebe visões e influências de portadores futuros do Titã de Ataque, o que afeta suas decisões e ações no presente. As consequências dessas ações acabam sendo parte dos eventos que ele viu nas suas visões, criando um laço de causalidade onde se poderia argumentar que as ações têm tanto o efeito quanto a causa em eventos passados, mesmo que não haja uma viagem temporal tradicional envolvida. Além disso, o poder de influenciar e ser influenciado através das gerações pelos possuidores do Titã de Ataque cria uma interconectividade onde as causas e efeitos se entrelaçam de forma complexa. Essas complexidades narrativas e loops causais são centrais para a trama de muitas histórias que lidam com a percepção do tempo, ciclos históricos e a ideia de destino versus livre arbítrio, que são temas explorados em \\"Shingeki no Kyojin\\". Portanto, enquanto o Paradoxo de Bootstrap envolve viagem no tempo e a formação de loops temporais sem origem clara, \\"Shingeki no Kyojin\\" aborda conceitos similarmente complexos envolvendo memórias e destinos cruzados entre seus personagens através das gerações."},{"instruction":"Please write an exciting, realistic story about a rugby match between Malory Towers and St Clare’s in the style of Angela Brazil’s early school stories. At both schools the main winter sport is rugby and the girls are all keen players. Write as if Malory Towers is the focus of our story. It is very muddy but none of the girls mind - they love getting to roll around in the mud. The match is close fought. Include some exciting, dramatic descriptions of key events in the match - tackles (successful or otherwise), rucks, mauls, tries, conversions - whatever you think will add to the fun and drama of the story.","output":"The brisk winter air was filled with the effervescent cries of schoolgirls as the day for the great rugby match between Malory Towers and St Clare's had arrived. From their lofty cliff-top perch, the girls of Malory Towers peered out onto the playing field below, which had devolved into a veritable quagmire after a morning of unremitting drizzle. It mattered not a jot to these hearty enthusiasts; mud was merely a friend that made today’s sporting encounter all the more delightful. Gwendoline Mary, usually so preoccupied with keeping her tresses impeccable, had even forsaken vanity for the sake of the sport. She was to play in the scrum-half position, a role that demanded agility and tactical wit, much to her own disbelief and that of her classmates. Darrell Rivers, the team's captain and fly-half, greeted her and the rest of the squad with a vigorous warmth and an infectious grin that could instill courage in the most timorous of hearts. The girls donned their jerseys, the proud navy and red of Malory Towers clashing with the emerald and white of St Clare's. They surged out onto the field in a cavalcade of determination, muddy terrain squelching benevolently beneath their cleated boots. As the whistle blew, the match stormed to life with an energy that sparked excitement in the chests of all present. Girls from both schools dashed hither and thither, passing and tackling with a gusto that would have even the old boys raising their brows in respect. There was Alicia Johns, fierce and nimble, performing a sidestep that sent her St Clare's marker sprawling before her, her maroon and blue sock a vivid beacon in the sea of green. Alicia tucked the oval treasure under her arm and charged with purpose. Through the mud, she wove, until at last, she was taken down in a glorious tackle that saw both her and the opposition’s flanker skidding several yards, ensconced in mud. A ruck ensued—girls from both teams threw themselves into the fray, heaving and striving for the ball with relentless determination. To all the onlookers, it was a maelstrom of shifting, wriggling schoolgirl limbs, from which Sally Hope suddenly emerged, ball in hand, passing it out quickly to Irene, noted for her sprightliness and less so for her attention to the game—yet today, she was entirely focused. Irene powered up the field, only to be caught in a maul that threatened to stifle her progress. The Malory crowd held their breath as Irene, grappling against the force, managed to pop the ball out to Darrell, who shook off her tackler with a gutsy twist and lunged for the line to score a breathtaking try. The sides exchanged lead as imperceptibly and frequently as light through leaves on a breezy day. A conversion here, a crafty dummy there, each school leaving a piece of their spirit stitched into the fabric of the game. Though spirited best efforts were made, no girl could maintain cleanliness—splattered jerseys and muddied faces did little to hinder their elation; if anything, it was relished as a badge of honor. As the clock waned, the game stood tantalizingly level. Malory Towers found themselves in possession once more, their eyes fixed upon the St Clare’s try line, mere metres away, yet every inch felt as unwieldy as a mile through this treacherous mud. Suddenly, Mary-Lou, the most unlikely of heroines, made a darting run. Heart in her throat and ball against her chest, she crossed into the in-goal area, pressing the ball down with such force one might have thought she was saving the world from peril. The kick that followed, taken by Darrell, was true and sweet, sauced with skill and followed by an uproarious cheer that would jest with the gulls and chase shivers down the spines of past alumni. The goal sealed a victory for Malory Towers, a win not of mere points, but of camaraderie, fervor, and the pure, unadulterated love for the game. As the girls of Malory Towers embraced, mirthful and mucky, they shared not just the glory of victory but the delight of a match played with heart, chums shoulder to shoulder, dauntlessly ready for whatever match would come next on their beloved rugby field. And though St Clare’s walked away defeated, their spirit remained undimmed; they knew that in the world of schoolgirl rugby, today’s rival was but tomorrow’s ally in the marvellous melee of the sport."},{"instruction":"","output":"It appears your message was empty. How may I assist you further?"},{"instruction":"Please write a follow on part of the story. The Malory Towers players banter with each other about exciting events in the match and how muddy it was as they get changed. They then share a light meal with their opponents in the common room and there is further good-natured banter and chaffing.","output":"Amidst the raucous exuberance of victory and as the last whistle echoed into memory, the girls of Malory Towers trudged back to the changing rooms, leaving a trail of sodden footprints and drips of mud in their wake. \\"By the stars, Gwendoline,\\" chortled Irene, wringing out a clump of mud from her hair, \\"I never pegged you as one to dive into a ruck headfirst. Weren't you worried about your precious complexion?\\" Gwendoline, peeling off her muddied jersey, allowed herself a small, proud smile. \\"Oh, hush! I'll have you all know that ruby mud packs are quite the fashion in Paris. I was merely ahead of the trend—besides, how could I let the team down at such a crucial point?\\" Darrell laughed heartily, her voice echoing off the walls as she struggled out of her boots. \\"Well, you've certainly started a new beauty trend at Malory Towers. I've never seen a more fearsome scrum-half covered in mud!\\" \\"Did you see Alicia's sidestep? I'd swear the ground shook with the force of her dodge!\\" exclaimed Sally Hope as she attempted to clean the mud from her ears. \\"That was nothing compared to Mary-Lou's try!\\" piped up Felicity, Darrell's younger sister, who'd watched the match keenly from the sidelines. \\"I thought she’d turned into a hare the way she sprinted through the St Clare’s defence!\\" All the girls joined in laughter, shaking their heads at the memory. Despite the mud-splattered faces and grass-stained knees, they helped each other with straps and laces, camaraderie shining through every action. After peeling away the layers of their muddy armor and donning fresh uniforms, the girls filed into the common room where a light meal awaited. St Clare's team had already arrived, looking just as much a patchwork of the pitch as Malory Towers' girls had before. \\"Welcome, St Clare’s!\\" Darrell called, as the girls from both teams mingled together. \\"Come to see how Malory Towers celebrates a win?\\" Patricia, the captain of St Clare’s, inclined her head with a wry grin. \\"More like to see whether you serve better sandwiches than you play rugby!\\" Her jest was met with good-natured laughter from all sides as the bench-banter flowed naturally into the common room. \\"You lot didn't think Irene's focus would last all match, did you?\\" teased Hilary, passing a plate of sandwiches to St Clare's wing. \\"We were taking bets on what minute she'd daydream and trot off the pitch!\\" Irene rolled her eyes playfully, retorting with, \\"Let it never be said that I'm easily distracted! Why, I didn’t even notice Felicity signalling wildly from the sidelines about… whatever it was.\\" More laughter followed, warming the room, as the serving of steaming hot cocoa and buttered scones continued to fortify the players from the inside out. Betty, St Clare’s scrum-half, aided by a mug of cocoa, remarked, \\"I thought we had you at that last scrum. Your lot could barely stand in the mud!\\" \\"Well, standing is quite beside the point in a scrum, isn’t it?\\" replied Jean, winking conspicuously. \\"It's all about pushing, and push we did—right into your half!\\" The light-hearted chaffing gave way to an easy companionship that seemed to stitch the friendly rivals closer together. Over shared stories and laughter, the remnants of rivalry were buried beneath budding friendships and mutual respect. As the evening advanced, the tired but elated warriors made their way to comfortable dorm beds, their hearts warm from the joy of the game and the unexpected connections made across teams. The girls of Malory Towers drifted off to sleep with dreams of muddy pitches, victorious tries, and the prospect of rematches yet to come, all the while knowing that the finest victories weren’t merely scored on the field but woven into the fabric of their treasured boarding school life."},{"instruction":"Guru Randhawa tells Mera kya hai main na.Main khud bhi apne aap ko jaanna chahta hoon na.Main khud apne aap ko karna chahta hoon.

Ensure the controller is located in the correct namespace and module to respond to \`api/v1\`. Here's an example of how you might configure the routes and controller: # 1. Configuring the routes: \`\`\`ruby # config/routes.rb Rails.application.routes.draw do namespace :api do namespace :v1 do get 'departure/destination', to: 'schedules#index' end end end \`\`\` With this configuration, HTTP GET requests to \`/api/v1/departure/destination\` will be routed to the \`index\` action of \`Api::V1::SchedulesController\`. # 2. Adjust your controller: You need to make sure your \`Api::V1::SchedulesController\` is designed to handle the required parameters (\`departure\`, \`destination\`, \`time\`, and \`restrict\`) from the URL query parameters. Your \`index\` method inside the controller seems to already include the logic to parse \`departure\`, \`destination\`, \`time\`, and \`restrict\`. # 3. Testing your endpoint: To query this endpoint, an external system or user would send a GET request structured like this: \`\`\` GET /api/v1/departure/destination?departure=stationName&destination=anotherStationName&time=12:00&restrict=true \`\`\` Make sure to validate that the \`departure\` and \`destination\` query parameters are present and follow whatever formats you expect (for example, underscores for spaces as your code suggests). # Final notes: The controller code could be more RESTful and/or embrace more Ruby on Rails conventions, but for the simplicity of this task, this setup should suffice.

Configuring the routes: Modify your \`routes.rb\` file to include a nested resource that captures \`departure\` and \`destination\` as part of the path (URL) rather than as GET parameters. \`\`\`ruby # config/routes.rb Rails.application.routes.draw do namespace :api do namespace :v1 do # Define route with departure and destination as URL segments get 'schedule/:departure/:destination', to: 'schedules#index' end end end \`\`\` This route now expects URL segments for \`:departure\` and \`:destination\`. # 2. Update your controller: With the new URL structure, the controller should be updated to use params directly from the URL segments instead of query parameters. \`\`\`ruby # app/controllers/api/v1/schedules_controller.rb class Api::V1::SchedulesController < ApplicationController def index # convert the dep and des station names to uppercase and replace underscores with spaces departure_station = params[:departure]&.upcase&.gsub('_', ' ') destination_station = params[:destination]&.upcase&.gsub('_', ' ') time = params[:time].present? ? Time.parse(params[:time]) : nil exclude = params[:restrict]&.downcase == 'true' # ... The rest of your logic as-is, since it's already using params end end \`\`\` Remember that \`params[:time]\` and \`params[:restrict]\` are still expected to be GET query parameters. This is because they are optional, and in many RESTful designs, filter-like parameters are often passed as GET query parameters. # 3. Testing your endpoint: To access schedules for a given departure and destination, now the URL format will be: \`\`\` GET /api/v1/schedule/DEPARTURE_STATION_NAME/DESTINATION_STATION_NAME?time=12:00&restrict=true \`\`\` You should replace \`DEPARTURE_STATION_NAME\` and \`DESTINATION_STATION_NAME\` with the actual station identifiers. The \`time\` and \`restrict\` query parameters should be added according to the desired search filters. # 4. Variable Name Adjustments: Since you now have \`departure\` and \`destination\` as part of the path, you shouldn't use \`gsub\` on them to replace underscore with space unless underscores are the actual symbols you expect in the URL for spaces. If spaces in station names are encoded as \`%20\` in URLs, there would be no need to adjust for underscores in your controller logic. Example URL with space encoded as \`%20\`: \`\`\` GET /api/v1/schedule/PALA%20STATION/KOTTAYAM%20STATION?time=12:00&restrict=true \`\`\` Ensure that any system that consumes this API encodes the URLs properly."},{"instruction":"Как включить на сервере HP Proliant DL380p Gen8 поддержку видеокарт с памятью более 16 ГБ?","output":"Серверы HP Proliant DL380p Gen8 по умолчанию не разрабатывались с учетом использования мощных графических карт, особенно с большим объемом видеопамяти. Поддержка видеокарт ограничивается несколькими ключевыми факторами, включая возможности системной платы, наличие соответствующих слотов расширения (PCIe), мощность и распределение энергии, а также тепловыделение. Если вы хотите установить видеокарту с большим объемом памяти (более 16 ГБ), вам необходимо выполнить ряд действий: 1. **Проверьте совместимость:** Убедитесь, что ваша видеокарта физически может быть установлена в сервер. это включает проверку размеров (форм-фактора), необходимости дополнительного питания и типа разъема PCIe. 2. **Обновите BIOS/UEFI:** Производитель сервера, HP, может предоставить обновления BIOS/UEFI, которые улучшат совместимость с новым оборудованием. Посетите официальный сайт поддержки HP, найдите модель вашего сервера и проверьте наличие более новых версий BIOS/UEFI. 3. **Проверьте настройки BIOS/UEFI:** Перейдите в настройки BIOS/UEFI и убедитесь, что все настройки, относящиеся к слотам PCIe, оптимизированы для поддержки вашей видеокарты. В некоторых случаях может потребоваться включение специальных режимов для расширенных графических возможностей. 4. **Питание:** Убедитесь, что у вашего сервера достаточно мощности для видеокарты, а также что блок питания имеет необходимые коннекторы для подключения видеокарты. Некоторые видеокарты требуют дополнительного питания через 6-пиновые или 8-пиновые PCIe power connectors. 5. **Охлаждение:** Проверьте систему охлаждения сервера.

A receita não está só ligada ou intimamente ligada à quantidade de negócios que você dá Isso a quantidade de negócios influencia Mas no caso da EFF, o câmbio influencia 5, o ano que vem for para 4,5 Com a mesma quantidade de negócioscios a receita vai cair 90% da receita é dólar, ou yendo, que não seja o real o campo é os prédios, oferta e demanda os prédios, para você ter uma ideia, hoje em dezembro está até pra cá, está 2 mil dólares. Em começo de janeiro já está 60% a mais disso. E dependendo do que acontecer até fevereiro, vai ser 4 mil, 5 mil dólares. Automaticamente isso, a receita dispara, mas não necessariamente significa que o lucro dispara na proporcionalidade. E vice-versa. Então, é um exercício de... Eu não gosto de dizer exercício de tecnologia. Tem que ter alguma ciência. Mas é bem difícil, principalmente pelo efeito câmera. Se nem os economistas sabem o que vai acontecer... Então, talvez a gente conversasse pro... Você entende mesmo, né? Eu... Eu vou... Olhar isso... Também. Acho que na verdade o lucro dele, com o Antônio Crescente, é o valor em cenário em reais. Então, é boa a situação. Não, entendi, mas é o que é que você ent reais. É o valor de exportação. Não, repetindo, mas é o percentual. É o percentual. Pode ser uma de volta para o valor adicionado. Então o valor adicionado em reais é o lucro dê. Se o lucro custa em dólar, 50 dólares, isso é dobro. Então, o lucro dê é sempre. É a exportação, portanto, o único poder que é valor adicionado em casa se você... custou... acho que são 2 mil dólares um dólar você tem que dividir tem uma lógica que se vai ser um dólar de 2 mil dólares 5% é 100 dólares então você faz parte é 100 dólares. O preço, você pode ficar com 100 dólares. 100 dólares pode ser 500 reais ou pode ser 400 reais. Independente do cargo do dado. Não, depende do cargo. Não, depende do efeito, né? Tem efeito no cargo, mas é sobre o custo dele em reais. É quase porque você forta um equipamento por 2 mil dólares. Mas você tem custo, por exemplo, de coisa importada. Uma produção, mil dólares, que você tem importado. E o outro é a parte de reais. Então o lucro dele da balança em reais, é o câmbio sobre essa parte de reais. Geralmente é o melhor. De qualquer maneira, a minha mensagem é assim, se você reparar ali, Sales Revenue e GOP, com exceção dos dois, a saudaria, o Sales Revenue sempre tem uma discrepância grande, mas o GOP não. Quando a gente olhar a EFS, a receita é menos importante do que o Gross Profit. Esse é o real número que a gente analisa muito mais. Qual é a segunda linha? Não, não, o DOP é a segunda linha. Se você for ver, 19 é a discrepância entre o ex-profit. Espeta, né? Pequena. 20 também. 21, 22. Eu vou colocar 9 reais, né, pessoal? Esse é mais fácil de você prever. Tá. Essa é a minha de você prever. Mas isso tem que ser refeito, porque esse plano da 2029 foi feito há 5 anos atrás, sem uma série de variáveis que aconteceram. A gente nem sabia que ia ter pandemia. Na verdade, o área dele, o grupo que eu fiz A variação do câmbio inferiça a variação do custo de renda. Se a variação do câmbio for maior do que a variação do dinheiro, ele vai ter um aumento de levamentação. É uma explicação. não está aqui, mas se olhar, é volumina. Assim, a conversão do câmbio, ela afeta a receita. Mas a... falou do FET, eu vi, talvez afete mais. O FET, em 2012, foi para 3,5, foi para 4,000. Não sei se é muito bom para ele, que eu provavelmente investi na semana nunca, o dólar deve acabar em 4,5 para baixo. Isso. Isso é muito bom. Mas aqui também que a gente tem que manter que a gente pode ver que o Brasil vai ganhar pelo investimento também. Se antecipar a partir do meio do ano, o dólar começa a bater para baixo. E pode vir assim, pode vir o dólar baixo, o dólar começa a baixar, vai para baixo, e quando o índice baixa, o dólar vai para baixo. O dólar baixa dólar, e o câmbio é mais ativado e quando o índice cai, o dólar cai. A área da... É, eu acho que também. Aumenta o volume de importação. Mas assim, acho que relacionando com a coisa que você falou da última vez, né, isso tem a ver com o impacto da importância da... da tua contratação, né, do... compras, etc, contratação de f última vez, né? Isso tem a ver com o impacto, a importância da sua contratação, né? Do compras, etc, contratação de fretes, né? É onde você consegue atuar e é bom separar esses efeitos, né? Que é o que você falou. Ah, vamos olhar volume, meio assim, câmbio, ok. Tá fora de controle, sei lá, exceto por se tivesse possibilidade de algum red de mais operacional e tal, mas esquece. Volumes, contratos a ser colocados, quanto mais separa, mais claro fica o que está acontecendo. Isso é um ótimo, porque a organização só olha o operário. Se cresceu, se não cresceu, mas... A resposta de um momento, acho que é irresponsável. O CN, por exemplo, sabe? Pode voltar a qualquer momento o seu time o pulo entre o Epshow 2022 e o Epshow 2023 você vê no passado não é um crescimento muito grande agora realmente você vê que ele está presentando um crescimento e assim está muito maior que o expected o budget de 2024 é de 110 milhões e falando de expected, o rooted já foi feito há 5 anos atrás então acho que precisa de uma revisão da receita de um código de uma forma mais simples por outro lado se eu olhar a linha de OP2 a linha de OP2 a página do arquivo, eu lembro eu abri com a pessoa do web é 4.1, 3.1, 3.8 5.5, 5.7 5.4 muito bom, muito bom acima da média, uma organização que quer dar os 3% do potencial que o mundo é, 3% como referência, muito bom. Em 2022 baixou e em 2019 também baixou, em conservação de e reresentação de projetos, cursos de representação, etc. O FlaC, em 2024, é que vem um bom momento. Mais? Comentário, Edson. Vai subir 1,5 milhão, nota 1, já subiu. Então, em 2024, vai atingir os 12 de apelo e os 3 de apelo, conforme a população. 23? 24. Ah, 24?osta. 23? 24. Ah, 24? É, 23. 24 a gente agora revisou o quanto? É, já está revisado um milhão e meio a mais. Por causa de novos contratos? A gente reduziu o custo do CDE Angoera, que é o mais impactante, achamos um plano de saúde que nos reajustou 50% este ano, a gente vai mudar de plano plano e aí vai ter uma... Pré-test. Vamos pra... Meu, vai ser vendido agora. Meu, vai ser vendido agora. Joga... Aqui, bro. A real... Vai ser vendido agora em... Em dezembro. Aqui, no Brasil. Aqui no Americano. Aqui, no Brasil. Aqui, no Brasil. Aqui, no Brasil. Aqui, no Brasil. que Eu não entendi a andalha. Chaco aqui, a gente vai prosfóriar. Bom, nessa mesma lista. Você conseguia baixar um pouco? Eu acho que sim. Tem que ter uma alegria, sempre tem negociação de diálogo real, tem negociação de médico, então esse 2.8 pode até não estar validado. É 3.2. É um desafio aqui porque os planos de losses previam ser 0.5% ou 0.2% Vamos crescer sem investir um pouquinho. A gente tem que pesar um leito. Esse é o maior desafio que é preso. Porque a área, a gente já anunciou de novo,ito, né? esse é o maior desafio que é preso nesse ponto, porque a área a gente abre no CDNOC, muito mais barato muito melhor, a tendência até se na Ianguera continuar difícil, a gente move tudo pra lá mas pessoas realmente é o desafio porque hoje a gente tem um custo por FT de 2.2 a meta é chegar em 1.8 mas é difícil. também, aquele é 50% do nosso, da nossa instituição de custos, 50% da nossa instituição de custos é gente, os outros 40% é aluguel, então 50% é gente, 40% aluguel e outros 10% energia elétrica, equipamento de movimentação, 1,5% e eu acho que a gente não dá importância estratégica em todo o processo nosso interno e o hospital Gente, como eu disse, eu tenho esse problema problema hospitalar o hospital é a mesma coisa um hospital, a área de saúde tem esse mesmo problema o único que está melhor e nem que, não é médico mas sem a agência não passa o problema é o custo mesmo, é tem um problema de qualificação a vida é nova então, não, mas você tem que entender a saúde se vale a pena você pagar mais caro, por exemplo, ela toma muito de valor, porque tem um professor que sabe que você não consegue pagar de curso, ou você não consegue, porque tem que pagar financiamento, tecnologia, então os salários são muito mais. Então, é uma discussão, você tem que valer a pena, porque é uma questão de produtividade maior. Você não vai sair de curso, então às vezes a gente paga um salário muito mais baixo, porque tem esses problemas de tamanho, de processo, né, a hora que você for a empresa. Mas não vale a pena, talvez você faça mais caro, como a gente dá uma oferta melhor, né, uma oferta de algo maior, né. Uma discussão que talvez não tem de dormir, né? a pessoa sentou-se assim, por sobre por... ah, é sobre a bróscola, né? o curso ao meio, né? as passadeiras assim, de seu domingão se esse curso ao meio tá morre do cano, isso af que o câmbio, isso é até de piada preventiva. Mais do que os contratos que todo mundo... Ah, bom, eu estou descontando o custo de frete. Ah, tá, tá. Ou seja, limpo disso e... O cross-profit, que é o lucro bruto, tudo que gasta, ou gasta com pessoas, ou com aluguéis, etc. Isso é R 75,5% Tá, tá entendido Então, eu acho que o nosso é melhor Ah, o Brad clarinha bastante É Isso, assim, é só um tema pra gente discutir seriamente quando a gente tá foco nesse assunto No mesmo ponto, primeiro qualidade qualidade, identidade e a tradição é muito mais profunda do que a gente vai entender qualidade, valor agregado que o funcionário coloca na operação isso não tem mais produtividade, porque estava discutindo a droga, no caso escrevemos uma operação de desembaração da língua, geramos perda, os funcionários saíram, perdemos histórico é assim, é interessante que como tema de RH, qualquer tema de RH, a gente acha um milhão de reais a gente aqui, no ano passado, nós gastamos A gente aqui, no ano passado, nós gastamos… # Transcrição 01 já tá perdida, se hoje já não tem emprego, daquela pessoa que foi a primeira, que não tem, que já desempregou, eu sou muito preocupado, então como é que a gente faz isso? Pra profitabilizar o negócio com o dobro dos funcionários e desabis a qualidade dos profissionais que a gente tem, concordo que tem essa tipo de treinamento, mas a gente é muito simples, a gente faz. E o pior é o seguinte, quando você faz, depois o cara vai. A gente treina, investe, procura e ganha. O que a gente faz? Pra contribuir socialmente e economicamente, o que é o principal? Por exemplo, o Internet, nós estamos garantidos, quantos temos, afinal, o principal é o nosso nosso nosso nosso garantido Eu vou entrar, eu falo, fala. Você pode. Eu acho que você tem que. Você pode. Eu vou entrar, eu falo, fala. Você pode. Eu vou entrar, eu falo, fala. Você pode. Eu vou entrar, eu falo, fala. Você pode. Eu vou entrar, eu falo, falo. Você pode. Eu vou entrar, eu falo, falo.

Você pode. calça eletrônica ou whatsapp ou já se deu por que eu não entendi isso né? eu ainda acredito que o ser humano é necessário pra fazer a pandemia por exemplo, mas a pandemia, a gente não tem uma recepcionista importante é o meu telefone então, isso é um contrato vou perguntar o que é o contrato talvez e são muito grandes. Então, é precário que a unidade de amplidade... Então, o risco... O risco não precisa ser assim, mas é uma opção. Então, você pode fazer ou só crescer também. Você cresce, e faz. E para crescer, tem que ser I tak jest ten temat, który mówił, modelo de gestão, e de ciência profissional você usa negócio, modelo de gestão, e ciência profissional tem coisa de ciência profissional, você pode fazer o que quer você pode fazer o que quer, você pode fazer o que quer você pode fazer o que quer, você pode fazer o que quer você pode fazer o que quer, você pode fazer o que quer você pode, nesse caso, comprar a você não compreende isso Então... Eu... Eu uso o Core, né? Eu uso o que o Zé me pede, que é emblemático A gente tá empregando bastante gente Foram 180, 180, 180 Mas o tipo de negócio de um dos escopos são quatro É insano até ergonômico a pessoa carrega a caixa de oito, nove quilos a minha ideia é transcrever esse 120, por exemplo pra atividade de armazenagem mesmo, aí é diferente eu vou crer sem outro business da dentro tirar o componente que tá lá que é a minha empresa eu pego outro escopo e esse é o automativo e se eu não automatizo, vai vir alguém que vai fazer, né? porque é insano que tá no alto cerimônio esse é um exemplo... e aí também a gente pensar esse negócio foi novo aqui pro Sudeste, lá em Manaus já existia de operar desse jeito dentro da planta mas o tipo de atividade eu não acho que seja o que a gente deve replicar, né? Mas sim, eu acho que a gente tem condição de afiliar, mas um estou vendo assim, né, o emprego assim, né, o Brasil, historicamente, se tornou um emprego, o que é que eu posso suvar, né? Desde o século XX, quando começou a industrializar, em que você pode saber, muito no Brasil, mas com a evolução da economia, quando a gente fala em indústrias, que são muito efetivas, né, então a gente vê que a indústria, realmente, ela começa a entregar cada vez menos, menos pessoas. Agora, o Brasil, a gente fala que é umaústria, finalmente, ela começa a entregar cada vez menos pessoas. Os agrobírios, as agrobírias, eles falcam do objetivo, né? O Brasil não paga imposto e não impede a ninguém. Mas ele imita a tecnologia, né? Mas a cadeia dela emprega muito. Isso é curioso, né? Então você vê que, mesmo assim, a gente vê muito esse afaraná, quando a gente fala de produção de produtos de serviços automóveis. Afaná mudou muito quando a produção pública de Charlaró. Então, ver a produção musical é muito interessante. O japonês, por exemplo, é muito interessante. Por exemplo, o Samba, por exemplo, foi falado em uma música muito recente. E o japonês vem de agora, em 1515. As plantas japonesas, em comparação com as que tem aqui, não sei se vocês viram uma bolsa aqui, mas é enorme, as plantas japonesas são pequenininhas, muito robotizadas, é tudo muito automatizado e já é um pouco em prego em relação às plantaduras americanas e europeias. Mas você pega a fibra e RGN e elas crescem muito porque a partir de ver essa indústria muito especializada elas vão ter emprego direto, né? mas ela cria uma série de empregos em volta é de serenismo, né? mas aí é uma maneira mais comunicada de dar tempo então assim, tem um verbo, né? se você, uma indústriaria começa a se sofisticar muito, o seu primeiro efeito é você contratando diretamente nela, mas você começa a gerar uma série de empregos em volta, de serviços de apoio a essa indústria. E ao mesmo tempo, como ela é mais recrutada, uma produção de aluno melhor, ela é mais produtiva. Então o PIB da região dependepende do subímetro. Tem esse dois e três também. Eu concordo com você, mas, no geral, você me deixou cair. Você só nos deu coisas, mas eu... Só isso que é estranho, viu? A gente é... Desde quando a... A gente vem sozinho, não faz a mesma coisa no Brasil. Não tem efeito de... o Brasil, a Inglaterra foi o primeiro país que se industrializou no século XIX, quando no século XX ela já não era uma indústria, ela era uma empresa, então ela virou um país de capitalismo norte-americano, mas em termos de ela aumentou no tempo, mas o emprego dela aumentou. No geral, vocês vão fazer mais. Qual você, amiga, pretende aumentar o seu emprego? Tem jeito, tem que ter um certo plano. Mas aí é focar em outros negócios, não dá. Mas eu já vou dizer isso, depende muito da quantificação geral. A gente não funciona muito isso. do que o que eu estou fazendo. sempre isso, ou qualquer coisa, muito sempre, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, muito, mu Eu acho que as duas palavras-chave que eu achei sai disso primeiro é a questão da produtividade. Quando a gente fala de pessoas, produtividade, o grupo que vai fazer o seu aposentado. Liga o custo, onde é o empréstimo, e a utilidade. É variável. A outra falta fechada, e eu acho que é sempre isso a clima, aí bato um pouquinho a cabeça dura, de que eu acredito que a automação vai até um ponto onde o ser humano gosta de ser atendido por pessoas. Ele quer ser atendido. Efectivamente, tem gente que não gosta de ser atendido por pessoas. Até os que compram o internet. Entendeu? Eles não falam das pessoas. Mas quando tem um problema... É loucura! Aí derruba a onda! Aí derruba a onda! Não tem jeito! e não é só as pessoas. Mas quando tem um problema, não dá problema. Não existe. Quando tem um problema, tem um número de solução, tem que fazer. A opção tem que fazer. Eu ainda acredito que tem direito a competir. Pode ser uma diferença, e tem essa diferença, mas pode ser um diferencial e tem que ser um diferencial, vai ser um diferencial que a gente tem que apostar. E nesse sentido, vamos lá outra vez, a questão de pessoas, né? Treinamento é uma opção, você treina as pessoas, eu faço um bem. Por exemplo, a moça aqui do Caixa da Pararia que toca o Café da Manhã, existe uma moça de pessoas que sabem atender bem. Eu acho que a gente conseguiu trazer isso para o mundo de cientistas pode ser uma solução estratégica. Produtividade? Eu faço isso bastante. Geralmente em aulas daqui, eu... Ou isso, mas... Só que pode ter tempo, talvez, e mesmo assim, mais gente não... Ou isso, eu posso ter em aulas, eu tenho nada de... Eu não quero ter muito controle, eu só quero que você faça a roda de câmbio Eu acho que ali é maior a gente fazer o que a gente quer A gente tá treinando todo lado, e a empresa tá aí É só provocação pra pensar, Edson, assim, eu acho que tem espaço Até eu não gosto de comprar online sempre, eu era do varejo eu adoro comprar online do mesmo jeito mas é acho que o Alexandre que mencionou da última vez que é como combinar as duas coisas porque de repente para aquelas coisas de baixo valor agregado que são transacionais simplesmente ter automação ter um que uma interface você consiga pedir para diminuir o seu estresse, melhor coisa do mundo. Agora, quando é uma interação de mau valor agregado, uma coisa mais consultiva, ou você quer resolver um problema, ou está reduzindo a attrition com o cliente depois, aí o contato pessoal faz diferença. Com o Customer Service você acaba sendo a combinação das duas coisas, né? Assim, você tirar, automatizar o máximo possível as coisas que... que é transacional, o cara não quer ter interação, não quer gastar um tempo conversando com o cara e... não. Mas na hora que eu tenho um problema ou na hora que eu vou fazer o projeto, tal, como que isso aqui pode ser o melhor possível? Como que junta as duas coisas, né? Acho que aí que tá tá um pouco segredo eu acho que vai ter que ser uma máquina de uma coisa né por outro lado levantou aquela questão se me correr se eu tiver errado alexandre dos da automação na hora de pedido de contratos tal que a gente a gente fala que a gente tem o digital mas ele é ele é um uma replica replica o manual né e tal mas é uma pessoa tá atrás e se vai esconder. Isso ainda não existe na nossa, assim como existe em outros tipos de varejo. Varejos todos nós compramos coisas. Realizativamente por o cara que falou com o bastidor de baixo do chão, o cara se lembra muito disso, era um pesadelo grande, aquele negócio muito grande, né? durante a pandemia ele usava muita luzinha, né? durante a pandemia ele tinha uma casa, e você não achava, ele tinha um casinho, e foi para a China, né? e o que ele comprou para ele, a empresa de luzinha da China, né? ele foi lá para o diretor da empresa, do ABAB, que está lá, o representante, contratou uma feita, aqui, a feita de cor, e comprou um passinho muito alto, quase toneladas, e foi lá no porto né, tirou a foto, mandou a foto, não foi? Ele chegou atrás, na alma livre, aí ele falou que vai lá de mês. Eu volto, até a primeira. Tá, peraí. Eu tenho algumas perguntas, só pra entender um pouquinho do número aqui. Quando você fala que as margens caíram por causa de maiores investimentos, isso é para entrar em segmentos novos ou é investimento mesmo? Na verdade, vamos falar de 23, né, de 2023. A gente fez os 7 novos negócios, então 7 novas operações. Duas completamente de escopos novos. Então a gente teve um prejuízo na PG de um milhão ao longo do ano Porque a gente estava aprendendo, não deixa de ser um investimento Não é que eu coloquei lá um elevador supersônico E não é que esse contrato, esse cliente por natureza é um cliente de menor margem Porque... Ele era uma margem justa para levar o negócio, não teve problema Mas assim, às vezes a gente tem que tomar alguns riscos para crescer, porque esse crescimento aqui serve um preço Não é assim, vou crescer com as melhores margens, né? Obviamente daqui, aí a gente mudou a volta no meio do caminho A gente renegociou tudo, mudou tudo, apontou para explicação, entendeu o business E a parceria é isso Então ao longo de dez meses a gente já mudou muito, já rentabilizou o contrato Mas teve um sangro no começo Isso é um exemplo Pode ser... Agora o investimento, por exemplo Como os projetos são aprovados individualmente, back to back. O risco de eu baixar margem por conta de investimento tecnológico é zero. A causa é essa entrada para um transelevador redondinho, uma baita margem, a depreciação toda calculada, o cliente vai pagar isso ao longo de cinco anos. Agora as adversidades, principalmente ligadas a pessoas, como a Edson Flores gastou um milhão em demissão e isso mais um milhão de problemas no P&G. A gente teve muita dificuldade em trazer pessoas, o que um homem faz a gente colocou duas mulheres, então aí você dobra, porque lá é força física. Então teve uma série de acontecimentos não previsíveis em projeto e aí é quando o plano dá errado. Acontece. Então aqui esse ano foi mais isso. Eletroluxo não foi a mesma coisa. Algumas imprevistos que a gente não... Mas são operações criadas puramente por pessoas. é muito mais possível utilizar o controle da parte traseira e o controle do controle do contrato porque o problema na margem, não é só o plano, todos os projetos que eu vi, eles são mecautrados sempre é um bom rendê-los, entende? se você tem um controle que vai com o problema no jogo, só a gente consegue fazer o último grau, manter as margens e tentar ver o quanto você consegue parceria com o cliente também, né? a gente tem que ter parceria, né? exatamente, quando ocorre esse problema, tem que chegar até a informação contábil do objetivo Exato, foi o que fizeram Foi o que foi feito Você consegue agrupar, clasifizar seus tipos de projetos de clientes? De contratos, perdão? Você consegue agrupar e... que é o projeto de clientes de contrato, perdão? Você consegue agrupar e tal? Basicamente hoje dividido em operações em house que aí é muito gente e os CDs individualizados que aí mistura e eu tenho outras linhas de custo que é aluguel, equipamento, pessoas, e CDs de clientes. Mas, por exemplo, tentando também uma coisa que o Saulo tinha falado outra vez, isso é olhando a dimensão produto ou serviço, né? Agora tem a outra, tem, sei lá, clientes mais complicados ou menos complicados, estou chutando alguma coisa aqui, e tem outra coisa que é a escala, que até você mencionou no outro momento, será que segmentando um pouco melhor isso, dá para saber bem onde que a gente deveria estar indo ou discutir isso, né? A gente tem plena clareza, e uma outra linha é o que a gente quer crescer, que é o 4, né, que eu falo, e o LNP a gente tá bem no comecinho, então o problema agora é de sistema mas eu acho que é um produto plug and play, tem boas margens como que é o nome disso? 4PL 4PL, é o LNP, é você fazer gestão da cadeia do cliente começa sempre fazendo a gestão de transporte sem fazer o transporte propriamente onde eu quero entrar, e você traz o conhecimento da cadeia do cliente para dentro Nós temos hoje um cliente que a gente faz a margenária, não faz o transporte, mas eu faço a gestão de tudo E pode estender para a área do internacional também. Eu acho que é uma boa sugestão. Eu acho que vai me envolver, eu estou oriente, a impressão minha é que eu estou a impressão, eu estou a impressão hoje, entendeu? Na verdade, são dois negócios que tem. A gente tem a habilidade, eu não tenho dúvida que são dois, mas não vai ser difícil. E o que é a sua geração? Eu sou o ex-jogador de um do outro. o ou ele pode se dividir É bem diferente. São dois tipos de materiais sanitários. Então são dois tipos diferentes. Bom, e... E o mesmo... A média, o caso de ter esse negócio... O exchange rate, a flacidão do exchange rate, o pessoal não vai mais saber. E o seu, é um negócio que pode sofrer alguma variação no projeto. Mas, naquele projeto só teria essa dificuldade você normalmente no início do projeto, nos primeiros 3 a 6 meses é ruim, até porque você não tem bolso de caixa já disse, aqui ó, o investimento, então acho que depende muito da empresa não por nada, a empresa, né o que seria interessante talvez era a área dele gerar caixa para publicidade e fazer o investimento dela. Talvez você fosse colocar um antigo na trilha de fala CG? Hoje a gente assume, a CL é a Ospicentro. Hoje a organização e a gente olha um pouquinho do contrário. Por causa de... ... ... ... ... ... ... Agora, quer que ligue a Garcinha. Preciso importar uma máquina do Japão que a Garcinha se manegue bem. Agora, frete, compra, venda, exporte. E deu, PIC. Então é o seguinte, olha, a Toyota, eu saí nos últimos dias, no decorrer dos próximos seis meses, pretende importar 20 contêineres por mês de Nascam, Shabani, Capri, Winged Beans, de Ranoia pra cá, e de São Paulo e Araleia, então, oito. Porque aí você fechou, você tem seis meses pra aventura. É mais ainda, né? Porque a rádio, eu solto e pra fechar. Mas quando fecha, tem cinco anos. Quatro anos. Tem uma lança para a Ana Lopez mas ela deve ter um período de tempo aqui é não se encaixa quando você falou que você conseguiu um dia de dinheiro então não se encaixa é, eu gostava que ela disse mais assim 6 anos mas é curto, é bem curto é 2 meses normalmente é uma garota tão grande se a gente realiza o projeto do jeito que foi implementado, já viu? desde o primeiro dia, é escorregado. Mas é assim, o ponto correto é assim, a partir do momento que você faz o clima, faz a prospecção, você pode pedir de investimento, você tem caixa ativando, né? Caixa? É, caixa ativando. Você fecha a conta, a caixaixa não dá pra vender, mas você deve vender, porque se ela vender, você tem que ter um modo de se manter. Quando dá pra conversar com o cliente, né? Quando você falou de polícia, eu perguntei qual o termo do contrato. É. Negócio de imóvel. É, serem no mínimo três. Principalmente quando envolve pessoas de área. Área então são cinco. Você precisa ver, talvez, o gelo do respeito, a metade do lugar, quanto... ou se como se eu erro a área. A partir do momento que você falha, por exemplo, pode ser que tenha um tipo de... de são de bem, de porém, na metade do quadrado. Eu chutei ali pra vir da metade do quadrado. em todos os que fazem essas análises inclusive regional e global nos cobra todo o NPV por cada um dos projetos tudo até o peito tudo se não tiver bonito não fazça O teselo de vocês, quando fecha o contrato, começa a começar o clínico? Começa a pagar Quando começa o clínico? A gente tem algumas... A gente fez muito uma jogada de caixa financeira, inclusive, com carências diárias Então a gente acaba utilizando essa carência para pagar os investimentos A gente minimizar esse impacto e o cliente já está nem pagando o aluguel para o cliente. Então tem algumas jogadas que a gente faz nesse começo para minimizar, mas... Então depois de vista do quanto o cliente se preserve pelo mundo, eu acho legal que o cliente se minimize. Porque você pode, por exemplo, fechar o contrato com o príncipe. Vou deixar um contrato com o príncipe por volta de seis meses. No mínimo, na minha área, seis meses. Chega a ser um ano. Então, pode ser que seja um ano de caixa negativa para cada projeto. Tudo bem, que depois o conjunto deve ser positivo para as máscaras que estão mostrando aqui. Então, principalmente, o ideal seria nesse período de seis meses, a área da chave, ele estar com o príncipeosto ideal seria nisso que ele disse, mesmo, ele está ali, ele está coprando. Você é imprensa. Sim, durante a conferição de presente de uma negociação, não tem caixa. Não, não, mas na verdade, você não está pensando. Não, não, não. Então, na verdade, é algo que é de investimento, a gente compra isso, né? Comprou, entendeu? O que acontece é, você começa a pagar algum investimento. Na gente conta isso, né? contra o... entende? o que acontece é, quando você começa a... a ver investimento, na verdade, você não... não tá fazendo nada, não sei... mas você tá com essa do pessoal, né? você tá com essa do sistema interno, né? pra fazer a prospecção, é investimento, né? a gente comentou aqui no outro webinar... acho que já tá lá... o hit rate... é importante pra você... também o tamanho do seu CAC, né, o seu cacho é muito alto, o cacho, a visualização no clipe, né. Ah, sim, alto. Esses ligadouros de telecompra ali, são bem interessantes, né, mas isso também é bastante indizante. E a linguagem também, talvez o pessoal vou nessas direções, né. Mas tem que fazer só por causa da conta, porque quando você começa a falar com cliente, ela vai deixar você com a pirada, não parece, mas você vai ficar. Tem salário, tem estrutura, né? Você fala pra ela que é normal, que ela precisa fazer isso, não tem jeito. Eu arrisco a dizer que hoje nós somos a área que eu faço gestão mais eficiente porque eu tenho um BD praticamente e em Solution Design agora eu vou para três pessoas mas eu vim até aqui com duas, com três pessoas há um salário médio de 12 mil reais, é muito eficiente Eu não sei se você precisa de contribuições para adversários com finanças, ou o que é, você faz solução assim Então, de certa forma eu tenho... Tem um backup para mim, né? Não, eu não faço um projeto para frente. Eu não faço, isso não é por mim. Mas é o business, gente, o set, né? Logicamente, o ideal era nessa estrutura, esporte, por exemplo, cobrir. O interagir para mim não é um problema. Isso certo. E você não conseguiu partilhar Você gastou a técnica e todos os recursos, né? Você não consegue investir no projeto de arte A importância é o fórum Então, o fórum, o custo pro BNP é o que a gente atinge, o fenômeno Hoje em dia a gente atinge uma maturidade que a gente só traga esses projetos, só aceita fazer bids Que físico é isso? Então tem 10 abordagens e a gente faz uma Então, é o olho que está achando o que que não vai se emocionar Exato Exato também Porque eu te falo, o olho do lado contrário Quem sabe comprar, você até o até o final, no final, te dá uma porrada Porque você já gastou tanto para desenvolver aquilo Que se você não conseguir aquele projeto, você vai começar de novo Não é sunk, não é sunk, porque aquele tempo está perdido Mas a gente já tem essa... essa... a vínceria que às vezes na segunda revisão a gente coloca é isso mesmo você vai ficar sofrendo nesse período que você já gastou parte né? então as pessoas não fazem ninguém e isso tem um jeito, elas fazem isso mesmo enrolam você até... trocas com o barco, depois você vai encontrar porque o cara falou, não tem que ir de qualquerxar de qualquer jeito, né? Então, sabe? Tempo pra sempre contra você Por isso que depois de tudo, não foi um barco, foi uma empresa, né? É, não sei se... Mas a gente hoje aqui, ou até pela maturidade do time, a gente tem um pouco de malícia já pra parar, às vezes, na segunda revisão Ah, gente, tá caindo a marcada, vamos pular fora Então, esse feeling, dá pra ver, né? Mas já fizemos e assim, todos os nossos concorrentes, inclusive, tem a pessoa batida, só que com estruturas muito maiores, mas desastre. Como tem duas estruturas, a estrutura da empresa, esse mercado de esporte dele, não tem suporte. Se o presidente derrubar esse mercado de esporte, ele não tem suporte. Se o presidente derrubar esse mercado de bloco, ele não vai ter empresa. Para tudo isso, tem que ter investimentos. A questão da extremidade... ... ... ... ... ... ... A gente olha o total, mas gente olha o total, a gente olha quebrar. É, então, por isso que eu falei, a gente tem que achar uma simples gente das áreas. Só que quando a gente tem uma empresa, a gente tem que ver como ela tem esse tipo de investimento, a gente mostra e a gente faz isso. A gente tem que fazer isso por dois anos. Mas eu tenho uma dúvida aqui, que é o seguinte, quer dizer, do ponto de vista do negócio concordo com você, que tem aí um ciclo de caixa e tal, como você pode utilizar, mas das coisas que a gente discutiu até agora não me parece que tem uma questão grave ou relevante de caixa, você tem que otimizar um pouco. Por outro lado, vocês colocaram uma expectativa aqui de uma rentabilidade, que é mais do que o dúvida que está sendo atingido até agora. Foi sonho? Qual que é a validez? Eu sei que não tem resposta pronta, né? O que a gente está discutindo. Mas foi sonho ou ainda tem coisa, oportunidade de melhorar? Quando que vocês enfermam isso? A gente está crescendo recente e os custos na mesma proporção. Você tinha que fazer isso ou isso o ganho de escala você não tá conseguindo na minha leitura é isso mas assim o DESC é o que tá aí, deixou de ser o objetivo da INVES tava mais conservador, isso aqui é o worst case e a pressão principalmente pro CER de alavancar mais para poder suportar o AFR aí a gente trouxe a receita, a gente vai crescer 20 milhões, é bastante empolga aí estamos ajustando a rota para abrir um pouco a boca do Jocarete, o CUL de Receita e Custo diminuir custo e manter esse crescimento de AFR e aí a última linha, tem uma lógica. Ou seja, as alavancas que a gente tá mexendo agora, e aí que eu pensaria, mas são questões mais relacionadas à rentabilidade, o tipo de negócio que a gente tá entrando, como o professor falou, é mais... Não sei lá. Tá. Não, mas é isso que eu tô falando, se nesse período, eu tô falandoanco de jeito se perdoa pela tentando ficar é negativo pode cortar essa parada, mas se tu usar o clonagem inteiro na mão do plano ele não consiga aumentar não consiga me fazer um spot em tempo, não consegue fazer uma coisa assim não consegue fazer um stack de risco não pode fazer isso, não pode fazer isso não pode fazer isso acho que a gente podia usar o velho conceitozinho de um cache-cable matrix para fazer isso para fazer esse efeito porque ali ele é o patrimônio, você tentar colocar os o que a gente tem um estudo corporativo de marcas do mercado. Então, tem a emergência de ser um dos nossos concorrentes japoneses, e os nossos concorrentes globais. Os próprios, os nomes. As marcas a gente tem que dizer que são, historicamente, as menores do mercado. E a gente tem o mundo. Ex-Fedidals, que é o Best in Class, 8%. Qualquer concorrente nosso japonês tem esse número. # Transcrição 02 não tá dentro das BUs e eu acho que nem deve estar, né? Se eu pensar em precisar os facentais, eu buscaria a forma de utilizar os recursos. Cada um tem um... A gente paga sobre... Tem esporte, então, né? Tem esporte... É demanda. Não, mas a gente paga por utilização. Então, tem carinho... Precisa contratar... Aí pode olhar... Mas que tipo de... Eu não tenho esse valor aqui, preciso levantar. Mas que tipo de advogado você contrata? Você contrata? Alguém é multabalista? Tributarista? Papodrato? Não dá Depende, mas eu queria voltar um pouquinho ao serviço O nosso custo de overhead, por que a gente precisa estruturar? Está claro, nós temos interna e impógnitas Hoje uma empresa de emprego deto atrás já fez um turning point. A gente não tem uma série de informações infernalizadas que a gente talvez tenha investido. Porque a gente é índio. Né? Só que o índio não sabe das coisas. Isso tribula a nossa área de investimentos e inversões. Isso é uma coisa. Esse é um ponto de investimento que ele é. Né? inerente. Agora tem uma outra parte que é a questão da produtividade. E se eu gostaria de fazer um tip da Juniors, porque ele conversa hoje, e eu vou do que eu escolhi. em muita atividade nós conseguimos a gente ainda não tem eu tenho certeza que a aquela Eu digo que... ... ... ... ... ... não só do operacional, mas geralmente. Porque produtividade é assim, uma coisa é você receber uma caixa, uma fita, descarregar, e quando falta a parte, você inclui o atalho do sistema. E essa é mensurável, né? É mensurável. Agora, o processo do Alexandre, você encontrou, ele vai lá, ele conversa, ele vai falar, depois ele faz o invite, ele vai falar o que ele quer, ele vai descrever o pagamento, vai lá, vai lá e assim, cambiar o registrado. que a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao público, a gente falou ao é impressionante como isso tem a ver com acordo de forma o fluxo com sim não exemplo que como estivemos passando embarque de eu contei, porque fui copiar. Foram 160 mensagens. Cadeia de 160 mensagens. Resultado? O cliente não embarcou com a gente e nós pagamos 95 mil dólares. Então foram 160 mensagens, eu não imagino quanto tempo a gente escreveu. Qual que era o termo? Por que 160 mensagens? Porque era uma questão de licença de exportação, porque era um produto refrigerado, e afinando se era refrigerado ou não, o que tinha que fazer no refrigerado, e não foi refrigerado, então o cliente recebeu e não quis pagar. Isso é um pouco de cultura, como o Deus diz, você podia pegar o telefone e botar tudo no ar, em 5 minutos resolvia tudo, né? Entendeu? Essa cultura de que escrever e ler e-mail vai trabalhar. Isso é um problema. Tem que tomar cuidado. Nós usamos o PADO para ele escrever e ler, nós usamos o PADO para ele resolver. Já tem uma cultura de que o e-mail... Mas o e-mail fez a função, fez o trabalho. Eu mandei o e-mail. Esse tudo eu acho que resume na accountability individual Então, o cara que tá fazendo 30 e meia, você vai tá perdendo tempo, você não perde o custo e não tá contribuindo pro resultado da empresa E assim, todo o mindset da empresa tem que ser voltado pra produtividade, pro resultado Eu sou uma analista de RH. Qual que é a minha produtividade diária para ajudar as B1s a ter o melhor resultado? Eu sou analista financeiro, analista de qualidade, pureidade. Então, acho que falta um pouco essa accountability geral. A gente começou a ter fóruns de discussão pesados em nosso resultado CL, que envololve todas as áreas, e aí vem o menino de H1 de aprendizagem, vamos mudar o modelo de carro para esses dois aqui, aluguei a gente economiza 10 mil reais, pronto, é isso, é esse o mindset. E a gente precisa pressionar ainda para que as pessoas pensem dessa forma, isso ainda não é natural. Acho que esse é o ponto de desenvolvimento de todo o dia. Mais uma pergunta aí, sem dúvida nenhuma, cultura, mindset é importante normalmente também tem um pequeno sistema de processo aí, né? quer dizer, como que é trocado, qual que é o processo de aprovação por quanto as pessoas tem que passar um embarque antes de colocar quanto que as informações são segmentadas não sei se é o caso essa é a pergunta, não sei. É a pessoa que... as pessoas têm alguns vícios de comunicação, a gente está trabalhando nessa parte cultural. Eu prefiro também, Fabiana, em logística, embora o modelo ideal seja comóbido, o que me importa é a quantidade de entrevistas do modelo é muito grande, impressionante. E eu acho que a gente patina. Mudou uma vírgula, E aí eu concordo que o processo... Até para ser justo, eu não deixaria só no momento cético. Às vezes tem coisa que... A forma... Sei lá, por exemplo, para mim soa... Eu entendi, mas não tem nada a ver com o que a gente está falando. Todo processo de aprovação, projeto a projeto, passar... Estou dizendo que seja uma coisa que dê para mudar. Chama atenção, não é? A atenção é isso que nos onera. Eu acho que tem outras questões. Eu volto nesse ponto. A grande mudança cultural que a gente está passando, no meu ponto de vista, é essa questão do comprometimento. Todo mundo... Quando eu comecei a saber, o família me fez ser vista, o hospital, por exemplo, não era o nosso, o nosso era usar RPA, por exemplo, né, fazer a recepção de RPA, né, todos os que usavam, né, porque, por exemplo, você vai pra anteninha, você é um público, não dá, né, para a gente ir melhorar, né, e não dá, ficou a mesma onda. Tô contando por carinho. Tem todos que fazem, todos que fizeram em São Paulo, por exemplo. Por exemplo, eu comprei um brebis, eu comprei um brebis, não tem jeito. O cara chega lá, às vezes o cara tinha um passaportal mal, uma cadeira, tem que alguém resolver lá. Às vezes a carteirinha tá com um número diferente, não passa, o cara tem que chegar, ligar e resolver. Isso depende do mundo, depende da pessoa que tá na hora. A gente resolve rápido. A gente fica bem doido resolvendo. Aí um assunto que é gravado, não sei se eu vou abrir, mas tem uma coisa que eu acho que é interessante, eu não sei se eu vou abrir, mas eu acho que eu vou abrir a conversação. Assim, faz um... não sei se existe o site, se não existe, eu vou abrir aqui. fazer um... não sei se existe o site... o senhor me sentiu bem intimado aqui a gente sabe... é, bem barato você tem que ter vontade de... assim... com todo respeito eu conseguia conversar com as pessoas quando a gente for de própria mídia, você dá um... você conversa, e é gostoso mercado de logística, em geral, é um mercado... você conversa, e é gostoso, né? Mercado de logística, em geral, é um mercado em que a mão de obra é lá o cara não conseguiu ir pra HP, não conseguiu ir pra Apple, não conseguiu ir pra AI Logística é um perfil de gente que era transportadora então, perfil de um hackeado, deixado, sei lá, errado, errado. E isso é uma questão estratégica pra pensar, porque eu vou treinar, mas eu não vou trazer, mas eu não valho o suficiente pra isso. Eu sei se dá pra fazer um diagnóstico. Nem todos... Não sei, não existe jeito. Mais uma maneira assim, sim, dá para fazer, mas eu acho que... Essa é uma das alavancas. Essa aqui a gente fala, ok, produtividade, mindset, etc. Tem algumas questões de negócio. Tem que juntar todos os pedaços para conseguir priorizar quais que atacam primeiro. Mas dá, mas dá, tem para fazer. Só acho isso, assim, só tem que tomar cuidado porque normalmente mistura as duas coisas. Às vezes, sim, tem questão de cultura, questão de perfil das pessoas, mas às vezes a gente também não ajuda com os processos que a gente tem. Eu não estou falando nada da IUS, porque eu não conheço, eu não sei como que é, mas muitas vezes você não favorece que a pessoa ajude, que ela aja de uma maneira mais ligada. Falando genericamente, tá? Não sei, vocês conhecem. Perfil próprio para o negócio. Porque a gente tem um progresso central, não necessariamente quem atende o área védica vai ser eficiente em atender o CR e BCV. E como são áreas comuns, é muito nítido. Tem gente que tem mais perfil para uma e tem gente que tem mais perfil para outra. Mas essa questão do ponto dos e-mails, ela é algo maior, eu acho que é comportamental e mesmo não é só comportamental, o modelo de gestão também é difícil porque a gente não vai copiar, quando alguém faz, sempre a gente está copiando esse tipo de coisa, então continua de ter que eu pago, vamos estar dando um mundo aqui para conversar e vamos resolver isso sim, pode ser também pode, pode. Também. Você não concorda com isso? Não é processo. De um outro nível, é. Eu queria, de fato, tentar esse doutorado, o Edifério, porque achei uma marra, mas não dá pra saber. Não vai ser professor, é assim que vai. Eu ajudo. Não importa, eu ajudo a mim mesmo. Não, só assim. É mais... Ouvir antes. E para... Bom, vou deixar isso aqui por aí. Antes de fazer uma entrevista, queria fechar a explicação e mostrar um pouquinho. Então... Mas foi boa a conversa, porque levantou bastante coisa aqui que para a gente deixar na lista né o radar e é só um álbum total Então no total aqui é a coluna de ID, Sales, Revenue, 98%, 110% Em EPSJO 2022 a gente foi para 184% EPSJO 2022, 184% Isso aqui é bruto, então, nós... A gente deve ter 3200 milhões de reais E a gente sempre teve o sonho de ser um empresa de 6 milhões de reais. Só que os férias falam que são falsas empresas. Então o ex-jogo de 2023 deve ficar em 5.650 milhões. O pódio em 2024 já vai ser em 797. E o expected, que é o déc, ele já estava, ele já estava, ele já estava, ele já estava em fase de passagem, o 10 é o, o 10 é o, isso é, é o plano de negócios, eu chamo ele de 10 porque a gente chama ele de 10 porque é o plano de negócios que foi aprovado quase fazendo mês. Mas ele ficou aprovado em qual ano? Em 2019. mas eu estou provando como melhor a gente aprovou o tempo e aí 157 em 2024 as sempre já vai, refaz aqui então bota uma visão né, pra gente ver essa pulguinha crescendo 10% ao ano, em 2027 a gente faz 210 milhões. Então, se a gente considerar que em 2026 a gente volta a fazer 200 milhões se continuar bem, se fizer aqueles 5 ou 10 postos no topo e aí a margem é 2,5 anos, não é? mas a gente quer aquela visão de 5% sabe a ágita do maçã, do sapato? o que que é 5%? é oi, é pica, isso a gente precisa definir mas a gente conjuntamente trabalhar com essa visão isso é mais interno nosso, talvez a gente não defenda antes mas é o que a gente quer chegar e aí sim a gente vai ver que mudar o nosso plano dinâmico vou fazer um negócio no campo assim vai vir embora o SIS com o SIS, nós vamos chegar no número o que é que eu precisei fazer no tipo? se você fica em 150 esse ano vou querer, tá bom, isso eu entendo. Você não vai ter crescimento nenhum em relação à inflação, e a inflação é do bom. Mas a inflação é muito complicada, Tiago. Mas... Mas eu concordo com você, financeiramente o investidor é pesadíssimo e reais quantos que você ganha? é, mas tem que ser em volume é lógico, é difícil, pelo menos eu não vou dividir não pode faltar, eu já estou dividindo tudo o cara vai ter pelo menos 20%. Deve que, deve que, possivelmente. Pode ir, só que isso não é o volume. Então a gente tem que abrir a receita e o volume para isso aqui, senão a gente vai ficar sempre em forma... Porque eu tenho muito problema com indicador, que francamente a gente coloca um número, mas a gente já vai sinalizar isso, o que significa o número. Se eu escrever uma matemária, o que significa, senão eu também vou ter que... É por serta que isso foi... É por isso que eu acho que a economia não está projetando em 0,5%. Eu acho que vai ter que ver. Então eu acho que a NQ vem ter uma oportunidade de conseguir volume. Agora, além das oportunidades também, e aí é uma impressão, eu tinha que fazer os números aqui, mas mesmo que a gente mantivesse esse crescimento daqui para frente, para os próximos cinco anos, será que isso aqui significa que a gente está no mesmo lugar ou está perdendo o market share, ou está ganhando? A impressão que dá, mas é por impressão, pelo menos para os próximos cinco anos a partir do que está aqui em 2024. Se juntar as expectativas de crescimento e tal, talvez esteja perdendo até. Não muda nada, é só um incentivo a mais para que dê. Tem que procurar algumas... não podemos nos contar, tem que voltar ao sonho, né? Dos 200 ou 200 e alguma coisa. Puts, que eu gostaria que a gente tirasse um minuto da nossa conversa. Onde queremos estar? Ou, não, onde queremos? Onde faz sentido estar? que é o que eu sou o diretor, né? e é mesmo, não sei, quem sou eu, o contrôlogo? e ele falou uma coisa, que foi um presente que eu me ensinei, né? no Brasil, em São Paulo, no Brasil e ele falou, é, eu não sei, eu não sei, eu não sei, eu não sei, eu não sei, eu não sei, eu não sei, eu não sei, eu não sei, eu não sei, eu não sei, eu não sei, eu não sei, eu não sei, eu não sei, eu não sei, eu não sei, eu não sei, eu não sei, eu não sei, eu não sei, eu não sei, eu não sei, eu não sei, eu não sei, eu não sei, eu não sei, eu não sei, é 3,5% né, mas ela é de família, agora a Mitsui comprou uma parte dela, só teve uma noite, passada assim, tinha o budget né, e ficava uns 15% abaixo, e sim, aí ele falou o instinto dele né, como se consiga, os investiam os motivos, na hora que eu consegui me apresentar, para não que o mercado caia, eu ia, eu ia tirar o preço, não sei o que, apresentava para o dono. A reação do dono, com o que ele falou, foi diferente. Ele falou, a gente é uma empresa, mas a gente tem 20% do mercado, eu tenho mais 80% para a gente tem 20% do mercado, temos 80% pra gente em si então começa a ser diferente né, aí eu vou com isso aqui né, aí fica bem diferente como eu vejo o cotidiano inteiro, é a cabeça de um empresário né que é tudo um negócio, né, tem que vender, né talvez você pode estar pensando no meu tempo, mas eu se dane desse jeito, como eu sei que é, né? Mas talvez, simplesmente, né, vocês... uma coisa, óbvio, ou então, não sejam muito grandes Uma coisa boa é que vocês possam crescer, né? Eu acho que, assim, francamente, eu gosto de colocar planos de curto prazo acessíveis, executáveis, esequíveis, eu gosto de colocar para os de bom prazo, bem ambiciosos você tem que buscar a resposta no meio do caminho, como é que você vai fazer diferente igual o modelo de negócio, eu não tenho nada disso, por isso que eu ainda vou ali para jogar o jogo não tem mudança no modelo de negócio, não tem aquisição no emprego eu acho que se a gente ficar aqui, nós não vamos ter efeito no nosso trabalho. A gente ia ter que achar um jeito disso pra 300, 400 milhões. Mas o que você está falando, com a gente? A gente conversou isso. A gente não vai ser dono mesmo. Um dono quer pensar em 400, 500 milhões? Talvez ele tenha que presumir se é coisa da outra jornada. Eu acho que esse é o plano que a gente conversou sempre. A gente foi falar que talvez a gente chegar deu sucesso, é a gente foi só lá, talvez a gente chegasse, fez um bocânico muito agressivo, 200, 200 e pouco, aí a gente não se convença, não tem como fazer uma aquisição aqui, porque tem um nível também daqui, né? Mas sim, pode ir para mais praia, praia chegada, pode ser renda, mas como a aquisição é muito grande, a gente não tem como fazer. Mas para isso, tem que ser 150, talvez para 200, e o que eu vou colocar é o tamanho da tabata. Maior que esse. Aí eu jogo com 4 horas aqui. Eu não sei como é que a gente tem que ganhar, é isso, né? Mas o que eu gosto da turma, da conversa, porque, assim, eu acho que nós como executivos a gente é exatamente responsável executivo qualquer doente do meia-raio qualquer doente do meio-estruturado, então vamos fazer, né? e se eu mostro qualquer doente direitinho até tal mês, né? deixa o seu povo, tudo bem já é difícil, né? Crear o poeta é tão difícil. Acho que a gente dá um pouquinho mais de crédito que isso. A gente dá um pouquinho mais de mérito que isso. E algumas vezes, sim, nós ficamos com família mal de volta. Mas, pessoal, o chá pôr, o pessoal é muito fraco. Se o poeta não consegue ter mérito, não é? Não conseguem ter informações. Eu, particularmente, acho que essa é a maneira pra gente se puxar dessa linha. Se a gente vai fazendo, vai fazer. Se não, a discussão... Acho que a gente tem que se desafiar. Então, se eu encosto em caixa de 150 a Buju é simples, né? teórico agressivo, então, acho que tem que dar uns 150, alguns 200 mil empresas. Quanto? 150. O quê? 150 milhões pra 200 milhões de empresas, né? Mas é 10% por ano. Eu acho que... Não, o teórico agressivo, mesmo, tem que dizer que é como se a inflação... Inflação, que é 6%. Inflação... you say. # Transcrição 03 onde agora é mais qualificada, treinamento, então assim, tem um verbal, se você é uma indústria que começa a se sofisticar muito, você é o primeiro efeito, você corta emprego diretamente nela, mas você começa a gerar uma série de empregos em volta, de serviços de apoio a essa indústria, e é uma indústria, como ela é mais, então não pode ser uma coleção de alimentos, ela é mais produtiva, né? Então o PIB da região tem que subir. Então tem esses dois efeitos também, né? Concordo com você. No cômpito geral, os empregos vão cair. Você soma as duas coisas, que o alimento é... A gente não tá vendo isso. Só isso estranha, viu? A gente é... desde quando a... Mas tem que ver isso no mundo, não basta ver isso no Brasil, porque tem efeitos de... A Inglaterra foi primeiro o país que se industrializou, no século XIX, né? Quando passou para o século XX, ela já não era mais uma cidade industrial, a Alemanha foi industrial. Só que ela virou um país de reclagem de capitais na Inglaterra, mas o emprego ainda aumentou. No geral. Aconteceu na Alemanha depois também. Aconteceu no Japão também. Quando você me representa muito a cliente, não tem jeito, tem que ter o touch man. Mas aí é focar em outros negócios, outros artes. Mas acho que eu concordo com você, isso depende muito da qualificação geral da mão de obra. A gente conversou muito isso, né? A Praça Itacapará, a gente usa muito exemplo aqui, a China, né? Um país puro, né? A China pura, não falando de ser um país puro, qual é o Japão? Eu acho que nessa variável, nessa equação, você ainda não colocou inteligência artificial para serviços. Procuram muitos empregos para ser contratados, muitos, muitos, muitos. Contadora, advogado, cara... Estou disposto, isso é uma boa conversa para um serviço. Mas esses países investiram 20 anos, não é? Chegaram hoje, no IBTEC que tem a Polistina mesmo, investiu 20 anos em educação forte, eu acho, investiu. Então, duas palavras chaves que eu acho que saem disso, primeiro é a questão da produtividade. Quando a gente fala de pessoas, produtividade eu acho que é uma palavra chave. Como é que, né? Tem gente na área de pessoas que tem muita mão de, é basicamente a área dele, a área dela, a gente é a área dele, né? Que o que a gente está falando, que é o lucro da gente, de ligar a custa de mão de obra em reais, é produtividade, é a variável que você faz. Isso é uma palavra chave. A outra palavra chave, eu acho que é serviço a cliente. Aí bato um pouquinho a cabeça dura minha de que eu acredito que a automação vai até um ponto, mas o ser humano gosta de ser atendido por uma pessoa. Ele quer ser atendido. Eventualmente tem gente que não gosta de ser atendido por pessoas. Raquel diz que compra muito pela internet. Na internet você não fala com as pessoas, mas quando tem um problema... Quando dá o problema... E dá o problema... A questão de ser atendido. Em números passos, você não tem o que fazer. Ou você não tem o que fazer. Então, eu ainda acredito que atendimento à cliente pode ser ser um diferencial e tem que ser um diferencial, eu acho que é um diferencial que a gente tem que apostar. E, nesse sentido, vamos lá outra vez a questão de pessoas. Treinamento é uma opção, você treinar as pessoas a fazerem um bom atendimento, mas também acredito que existe uma população de pessoas que sabem atender bem. Por exemplo, a moça aqui do caixa da padaria, que eu tomo café da manhã, existe uma massa de pessoas que sabem atender bem, e eu acho que a gente conseguir trazer isso pra dentro da IUC Logistics pode ser uma diferença estratégica. Produtividade, preocupação com o cliente. O treinamento em house aqui, problemas de forma menos? Muitos. Talvez valhesse a pena, talvez. Ou isso eu possa ter em house, treinado, eu suponho que as pessoas... É, é isso, né? Eu não quero ter âmbito de conclusão, mas quando a gente começar a falar de campus, eu acho que aí é uma área de fundamento que a gente peca, não é? A gente tá treinando por um lado, e a empresa tá indo pra um outro lado, uma direção não, por outro lado. Mas só uma provocação pra pensar, Edson, assim, é... eu acho que tem espaço, é... até o negócio de comprar online sempre, É só provocação pra pensar, Edson. Assim, eu acho que tem espaço... Até o negócio de comprar online sempre. Eu era do varejo e eu adoro comprar online do mesmo jeito. Mas eu quero por um exemplo. Acho que foi o Alexandre que mencionou da última vez, que é... Como combinar as duas coisas? Porque, de repente, pra aquelas coisas de baixo valor agregado, que são transacionais, simplesmente, ter automação, ter um interface que você consiga pedir para diminuir o teu stress, melhor coisa do mundo. Agora, quando é uma interação assim de mau valor agregado, uma coisa mais consultiva, ou você quer resolver um problema, ou você está reduzindo o attrition com o cliente depois, aí o contato pessoal faz diferença. O customer service acaba sendo a combinação das duas coisas, você tirar, automatizar o máximo possível as coisas que... quer transacionar, o cara não quer ter interação, não quer gastar um tempo conversando com o cara, e não, mas na hora que eu tenho um problema, ou na hora que eu vou fazer o projeto, como que isso aqui pode ser o melhor possível? Como que junta as duas coisas? Acho que aí que tá um pouco o segredo. Eu acho que isso... na era dele, você tá muito aqui, muito pessoal ainda, né? Quando dá um problema na era dele, também tem que falar pessoalmente, não dá pra ser uma máquina, alguma coisa, né? Você tá gruda aí com dois, né? Por outro lado, você levantou aquela questão, se me corri, se eu tiver errado, Alexandre, da automação na hora de pedido de contratos que a gente fala que a gente tem o digital, mas ele é uma replica manual Não existe ainda um digital na nossa indústria, existe o interface digital, não é interface digital, mas é uma pessoa que está atrás se respondendo. Isso ainda não existe na nossa, assim como existe em outros tipos de varejo. Em varejos, todos nós compramos coisas efetivamente por e-commerce. Em nossa indústria ainda não. Tem pessoas ainda, só que rápido, deixa eu ter que sair, né? Agora, estava em Brasília lá, um cara queria falar com o embaixador, falou com o embaixador tinha ido para o Brasil. Era um caso que não sabia, a empresa é grande aqui no Brasil, muito grande. Durante a pandemia eles usavam muito alumínio. Durante a pandemia o alumínio sumiu aqui, não tinha. Você não achava aqui no Brasil, não achava em Norte. Ele foi para a China, uma empresa... Alguém indicou para ele, uma empresa grande da China. Ele foi lá com os diretores, visitou a empresa, viu a fábrica lá, foi o representante, contratou uma trilha chinesa pra comprar aqui, a empresa indicou, e comprou assim, muita valoria, umas toneladas. De onde embarca, que foi lá no Porto, né? Chegou a foto, a foto, nos contei, né? Chegou a crassa. Não era aluguinha. Aí caiu a legenda, lá embaixo, que eu falei chinês, moleque. Eu volto daqui a meia hora. Tá, obrigado. Eu tenho algumas perguntas aqui, Raquel, só para entender um pouquinho do número aqui. Quando você fala que as margens caíram por causa de maiores investimentos, isso é para entrar em segmentos novos ou é investimento mesmo? Na verdade, vamos falar de 23, né? 22 e 23, a gente fechou 7 novos negócios. Então, 7 novas operações. Duas, polaramente, escope novos negócios. Então, sete novas operações. Duas com claramente escopos novos. Então, a gente teve um prejuízo na P&G de um milhão ao longo do ano. Porque a gente tava aprendendo da P&G. Não deixa de ser um investimento. Não é que eu coloquei lá um elevador supersonico. E não é que esse contrato, esse cliente, por natureza é um cliente de menor margem, porque... É, ele era uma margem justa para levar o negócio, não sei o que o problema. Mas assim, às vezes a gente tem que tomar alguns riscos para crescer, porque esse crescimento aqui teve um preço. Não é assim, vou crescer com as melhores margens, obviamente daqui, aí a gente mudou a rota no meio do caminho, a gente renegociou tudo, mudou tudo, mudou precificação, entendeu business e a parceria é isso. Então, ao longo de dez meses a gente já mudou muita coisa, já rentabilizou o contrato, mas teve umas... sangrou no começo. Esse é um exemplo, pode ser... Agora, o investimento, por exemplo, como os projetos são aprovados individualmente, back to back, o risco de eu baixar a margem por conta de investimento tecnológico é zero. A Causais vai entrar com um transelevador redondinho, com uma baixa margem. A depreciação toda calculada, quem que vai pagar isso ao longo de cinco anos? Agora, as adversidades, principalmente ligadas a pessoas, como o Edson Flores gastou 1 milhão em demissão e isso, mais 1 milhão de problemas na TG. A gente teve muita dificuldade de trazer pessoas, o que um homem faz, a gente colocou duas mulheres, então aí você dobra, porque lá é força física. Então teve uma série de acontecimentos não previsíveis em projeto. E aí é quando o programa, o plano dá errado. Acontece. Então aqui, esse ano foi mais isso. Eletroluxo no sul é a mesma coisa. Algumas imprevistos que a gente não... Mas são operações que é puramente pessoas. Isso que a gente comentou, né? Por isso que precisava... Aprendi da parte parte financeira de controladoria de contrato. Porque o problema na margem não é só com ela, todos os projetos que eu vi é na execução do contrato. Sempre ocorre imprejuízo, não tem jeito. Se você tem uma controladoria que vai acompanhando e junto com a área dela, consegue mitigar, manter as margens dentro do projeto. Você consegue... Tem muita parceria com o cliente também, né? A gente tem que ter parceiro. Então, porque quando acontece isso, exatamente quando ocorre esse problema, tem que chegar e reanimação do contrato, não tem jeito. Exato, foi o que fizeram. Tem que reanimação do contrato, não tem jeito. Foi o que foi feito. Você consegue agrupar ou clasterizar seus tipos de... de projeto de clientes, de... de contrato, perdão? Você consegue agrupar em... Sim, basicamente hoje dividido em operações em house, que aí é muito gente, e os CDs individualizados, que aí mistura, e eu tenho outras linhas de custo, que é aluguel, equipamento, pessoas e CDs multiclientes. Mas, por exemplo, tentando também uma coisa que o Saldo tinha falado outra vez, isso é olhando a dimensão produto ou serviço, né? Agora tem outra, tem, sei lá, clientes mais complicados ou menos complicados, tô chutando alguma coisa aqui, e tem outra coisa que é a escala, que até você mencionou no outro momento. Será que segmentando um pouco melhor isso, dá para saber bem onde que a gente deveria estar indo ou não? Ou discutir isso, né? A gente tem plena clareza. E uma outra linha, é o que a gente quer crescer, que é o 4PL, né? E o LLP. A gente tá bem no comecinho, tá com problema agora de sistema, mas eu acho que é um produto pro V&P, tem boas margens. Como que é o nome, desculpa? 4PL. É o 4PL, é o LLP. Você faz a gestão da cadeia do cliente, começa sem fazer a gestão de transporte, sem fazer o transporte propriamente, que é o grupo que você se quer entrar. E você traz o conhecimento da cadeia do cliente para dentro. A gente faz a armazenagem, não faz o transporte, mas eu faço a gestão de tudo. Então, e pode estender para a área do internacional também. Acho que é uma sugestão. Uma coisa só, agora, deixando de voltar, a gente pode... A impressão minha é que a gente tem uma impressão, a gente tem uma impressão no último modelo, né? Na verdade, são dois negócios diferentes, né? Não deixando de dar aquela impressão. A minha impressão é que são dois negócios aqui dentro, né? Alexandre e Dar, que pelo meu impressionamento são dois personagens diferentes. Talvez seja mais de dois. É, mas por exemplo... O trabalho dela é mais de consultoria que a gente está vendo, né? E o dele é mais de treino, né? Isso, isso. Então talvez nesse canvas aqui, né... Ou ele possa dividir. Ou dividir, né? Porque aí trabalha em sinergia, porque o Della normalmente tem esse problema, que tem um período que é... o Della tem um período de investimento de maturação, pode dar prejuízo a algum período, né, mas tem que dar uma coisa de inversão. A Adelia não, a Adelia é mais direto, né, porque a Adelia é trade, com mote, né. Então acho que são dois negócios diferentes, acho que talvez, com dois negócios, com dois tipos de maturações diferentes, e dois tipos de donos diferentes. Bom, e o dele a médio prazo deveria ser um negócio, agora, regardless the exchange rate, ou seja, afastando o exchange rate, isso é um negócio mais fácil. E o seu é um negócio que pode sofrer algumas variações por projeto. Mas, naquele projeto, sua tendência é ficar... Normalmente, no início do projeto, os primeiros três a seis meses, é ruim. Até porque você tem um desembolso de caixa. É, que é o investimento. Então, acho que talvez, quando a gente dá empresa, não foi um das áreas, da empresa, né empresa. O que seria interessante talvez era a área dele gerar caixa para a polícia, que não fosse pelo investimento dela. Talvez você fosse a antiga matriz do ICG, é o cash cow. Hoje a gente é super, a CL é a Oficina. Hoje a organização e a gente olha um pouquinho o contrário. Por causa da dificuldade do Alexandre com o Cinemática, aí tem uma outra discussão, depois a gente pode entrar em mais detalhes. No Alexandre existem dois tipos de negócio. O spot, que é aquele cara que diz, preciso importar uma máquina do Japão para o Brasil semana que vem. Agora, frete, compra, venda, Spot. E tem o PID. O PID. Que é o seguinte, olha, a Toyota, mil semelhantes desses, no decorrer dos próximos seis meses, pretende importar 20 contêinas por mês de Lamshabang, na Tailândia, para cá, e mais 20 de Hanoi para cá. Por favor, me apresenta uma proposta. Então, é o 20. Porque aí, se você fechou, você tem seis meses garantido. No caso da Raquel, é mais ainda, porque a Raquel sofre para fechar, mas quando fecha, tem cinco anos. Quatro anos, três anos, 3 anos... Mas ela deve ter um período que nega que o projeto dela. É... Mas é caixa. Não, não, mas aí você... você... o investimento, né? É... Esse caixa que você tá falando. É... Ah, é... eu acho que a Raquel disse, mas assim... Ah, você que seja o Learning Curve, quer dizer... É curto, é bem curto. É curto, é curto. É dois meses. É cur curva de aprendizado. É bem curta. É curta. É dois meses. Normalmente... E mais uma vez, normalmente isso acontece porque a gente peca na qualidade dos profissionais que a gente regere. Esse ano foi um exemplo. Se a gente realiza o projeto do jeito que foi planejado, desde o primeiro dia... Não, exatamente. É escorregado. Mas a conta correta é assim, a partir do momento que você faz o cliente, faz a prospecção, aí você perde o investimento e você tem caixa negativa aí. Caixa? Caixa! Negativa aí, né? Você fecha o contrato, fecha o contrato até, né? Mas você tem um período aqui, você deve ficar um ano, um ano, tentando conversar com o cliente, né? Mas, Odissey, por isso eu perguntei qual o tempo do contrato. É. Não é um negócio de um ano. É. Não, séria no mínimo três, principalmente quando envolve pessoas de área. Área então, só cinco. O que você precisa ver, talvez, olhando na perspectiva de caixa, tem que olhar quanto... como eu sou ROI. ROI, né? Isso, isso, isso. A partir do momento que você faz, eu posso fazer um... Qual o seu tempo de payback? Ela tá em dois anos e meio, por aí, metade do contrato. Eu chutaria que deve dar metade do contrato. Em todos os que a gente passa essas análises, inclusive, a Jornal e Global nos cobra todo o NPV por cada um dos projetos. Tudo. Até o... Tudo, tudo, tudo. Não passa. Se não tiver bonito, não passa. O T0 de vocês é quando fecha o contrato ou quando começa a conversa com o cliente? Quando começa a falar com o cliente. A gente fez uma jogada de caixa financeira, inclusive, com carências diárias. Então a gente acaba utilizando essa carência para pagar os investimentos. Então, a gente minimiza esse impacto e o cliente já está nem pagando o aluguel, por exemplo. Então, tem algumas logadas que a gente faz nesse começo para minimizar, mas... Então, do ponto de vista do quão guia a empresa, esse TESERV, então, um... O caixa negativo, não tem jeito, é todo investimento assim, né? Caixa negativo. É. Não sei quanto é esse... Qual com o cliente, médio, para fechar um contrato com o cliente, se for conversado com o condomínio. Seis meses. Seis meses? No mínimo, no mínimo, na minha área, seis meses. Tá, tudo bem. A gente vai dar cerca de um ano. Então, pode ter seis a um ano de caixa negativa, no caso da projeta, né? Tudo bem, que depois, no conjunto, deve ser positivo, pelas máscaras que estão mostrando aqui, né? Então, principalmente, o ideal seria, nesse período período de seis meses a área da Exxandria ele estar cobrindo, no ponto de vista da empresa. Assim, durante a construção de projeto de negociação não tem caixa. Não, não, mas na verdade ela está gastando. Então, na verdade, é o tempo de investimento, a gente conta isso no playback. Porque o T-Zero, quando você começa a fazer investimento, na verdade, você não está fazendo nada. Mas você está gastando pessoal, você está gastando estudo interno para fazer a prospecção, é investimento. A gente comentou aqui na outra reunião, acho que detalhado, o hit ratio, que é um indicador importante para você, está a ver com o tamanho do seu CAC, o seu CAC é muito alto, o custo de aquisição do cliente. Acho que esses indicadores de telecom para a gente aqui são bem interessantes. Você está pedindo isso. E aí o ARPU, para a gente pensar um pouco nessas dimensões. Pode ser essa conta, porque quando você começa a falar com o cliente, até você fechar o contrato, não parece, mas você tem esse bote de caixa. Tem salário, tem estrutura. É um investimento que você faz, mas é normal, porque a área dela precisa fazer isso, não tem jeito. Mas eu acho que hoje nós somos, é a área que eu faço gestão mais eficiente. Porque eu tenho um BD praticamente, e em Solution Design agora eu vou para três pessoas. Mas eu vim até aqui com duas. Com três pessoas. O salário mege de 12 mil reais. É muito... Eu não sei se você também precisa de contribuições transversais. Finanças, não sei o que, você faz tudo sozinho. Então, de certa forma, tem uma... É, tem um back office também, né? Não, eu não faço um projeto pra frente. Tem um hidden cost aí na estrutura. É, tem esse... Mas é a luz, né, gente? Claro. Não, não precisa falar, porque como você falou, acho que o ideal era nessa estrutura, a esporte da Alexandre, cobrir. O hit ratio pra mim não é o problema do custo. É o problema do insucesso. E você não conseguiu o projeto. Por isso que a estatutéia é que todos os recursos, não tem problema com recursos, o problema é que você não consegue, se você investir no projeto errado. Portanto, você deve... É verdade. ...comprar o total. Isso pode ir pra gente. Total? O custo propria de um para um cliente é enorme. Mas eu só trago hoje, a gente já tinha uma maturidade, que a gente só traz projetos, só aceita fazer vídeos que fitem com isso. Então entra, tem 10 abordagens, a gente faz uma. Então, é o order detection do que que não vai funcionar. Exatamente. Porque eu te falo, agora do lado comprador, quem sabe comprar, arrasta você até o final e no final chega uma porrada. Porque você gastou tanto pra desenvolver aquilo, que se você não conseguir aquele projeto, você vai começar de novo um, não é sunk. Não é sunk. Porque aquele tempo tá perdido. É louco o negócio. Entendeu? e as vezes elas fazem isso mesmo, enrolam você até pra jogar o brinquedo lá embaixo depois pra fechar, né? Porque o cara fala, não tem que fechar de qualquer jeito, né? A gente não sabe... O tempo tá sempre contra você. Por isso que depois de tudo, não foi a empresa da empresa, né? Você seria possível. Mas a gente hoje aqui, ou até pela maturidade do time, a gente tem um pouco de malícia já pra parar, às vezes, na segunda revisão. Ah, gente, tá carregando a carga está largada, vamos pular fora. Então, esse feeling já dá para ter, né? Mas já fizemos, e assim, todos os nossos concorrentes, inclusive, tem a mesma batida, só que com estruturas muito maiores, mais pesadas. Bom, conta isso, como tem duas estruturas, o ideal seria o ponto de vista da empresa, esse mercado de esporte dele, que não tem esse custo de investimento da Alexandra. Se pudesse desenvolver esse mercado de esporte dele, que não tem esse custo de investimento. Se a empresa desenvolver esse mercado de esporte, vem da empresa para cobrir esse período de investimento. Aí entra na questão do Alexandre, entra a função do UFPM, que é o cara financeiro, isso a gente vai discutir no Canvas também. Isso é uma coisa que a gente tem que passar a olhar melhor. A gente olha o total aqui, a gente olha o total, mas a gente não olha quebrado. Então, por isso que eu falei, interessante era achar uma simergente das áreas. Isso é uma produção que faz renda, a gente já percebeu isso. Como ela tem esperto investimento, a gente mostrou que a gente passa isso. A gente olha as vezes né, a saúde. Tem cara que fala as vezes dois anos a saúde. A gente tem cara que rola a gente há dois anos. Tem que recorrer a isso. Eu tenho uma dúvida aqui que é o seguinte, quer dizer, do ponto de vista do negócio concordo com você, que você tem aí um ciclo de caixa, tal, com o que você pode utilizar. Mas das coisas que a gente discutiu até agora, não me parece que tem uma questão grave ou relevante de caixa. Você que deve protinizar um pouco. Por outro lado, vocês colocaram uma expectativa aqui de uma rentabilidade é mais do que o dobro da que está sendo atingido até agora foi sonho que qualquer vale se você que não tem resposta pronta né o que a gente está discutindo mas foi sonho ou ainda tem coisa oportunidade de melhorar como vocês enxergam isso? A gente está crescendo receita e os custos na mesma proporção eu tinha que fazer isso ou isso o ganho de escala você não está conseguindo na minha leitura é isso mas assim o 10 que é o que está aí deixou de ser o objetivo da empresa ela é mais conservadora, isso aqui é o worst case, né? E a pressão principalmente pro CL de alavancar mais pra poder suportar o IFE, aí a gente trouxe a receita, a gente vai crescer 20 milhões, é bastante coisa. Aí tamo ajustando a rota pra abrir boca a boca do Jacaré de receita e custo, diminuir custo e manter esse crescimento de receita. E aí a última linha. Tem uma lógica. Ou seja, as alavancas que a gente tá mexendo agora, e aí que eu pensaria, mas são questões mais relacionadas a rentabilidade, o tipo de negócio que a gente tá entrando, como que eu tô... É mais... As custos. Exato. Tá. Não, mas é isso que eu tô falando. Se nesse período, eu não está otimizando, estou falando de um monte de obra aqui no Brasil, a gente sabe, mas nesse período, que entra no balanço, não tem jeito, nesse período que ela tem entrando aqui, que fica, é negativo, isso entra no balanço, não tem jeito, entra aqui. Agora, se esse período for otimizado com a área dele, não precisa ser nem isso, a gente pode pensar dessa parada, mas vamos usar o global dentro dele. Fazer um plano, que ele consiga aumentar os seus mercados de esporte dele, ou alguma coisa assim no mercado dele, pra cobrir esse período. Obviamente vai aparecer um valor, não vai sair da venda, vai aumentar no final. É. Acho que a gente podia usar o velho conceitozinho, que a gente não tá perd perdido do cash cow matrix da matriz da BCG, acho que ali é bacaninha pra você tentar colocar os diversos. E o IFF não é cash cow, infelizmente, nesse momento. Só complementar um ponto do Fabiano, sonho, objetivo, etc. E se a gente tem um estudo corporativo de margens do mercado. Então, tem a Yusuke Logistics, que são os nossos concorrentes japoneses e os nossos concorrentes globais. Não é o japonês global, mas os globais. As margens da Yusuke Logistics são, historicamente, as menores do mercado. E a gente tem um número, né? Então, por exemplo, Expeditors, que é o best in class no mundo, tem 8%. 8%. Qualquer concorrente nosso japonês tem 5%. Qualquer concorrente japonês. Os japoneses, né? E se eu tivesse que falar alguma coisa, explica isso. Qual que você vê? Acho que a escada também, até porque eu tô com a escada. É, assim, eu... Não tenho resposta. Porque depende de pensar globalmente, né? Globalmente. E pensar como... Você já fez esse trabalho, né? Eu não tenho resposta. E não sei se a escada. Porque nós temos os componentes menores que trazem mais. Esse é o problema que a gente comenta todos, né? Agora, porque a... Como você trabalha com a... Ele saiu recentemente, né? Mas não é um sombrado japonês, né? O seu agora é argentino, né? Esquisito. Aqui no Brasil, é um colombiano, né? Só se você comentar um pouco da... Do outro, né? É, agora... Isso é bobagem, deixa eu. Hã? Ah, eu só... Não, eu quero... Senão, vai... Tá caindo tudo, precisa chamar o médico. Ah, tá. Já ouviu, já ouviu. Desculpa. Não, não é essa, não vai... Acho que foi culpa minha, Marcelo, tinha que botar errado. Tinha que botar pro meu pouch. Saiu o cartão. Eles não conhecem o Ayuso. Que Ayuso que é? A Nissan. Eu ia comentar, eles fazem com a Nipro muito, né? A Nipro que é da mais antiga, né? Acho que a Nipro foi desde os anos 70 aqui no Brasil, né? Nitsu? É Nitsu. Nippon é da década 70 aqui no Brasil, né? Nippo Express, né? Nippo Express, né? Eles conhecem muito a Nipson, né? Mas aí vocês não conheciam a colega que a gente conversou, né? Será que não vai valer a pena fazer mais de... Acho que isso vai discutir também. Assim... Eu vou dar uma desculpa. Eu só pergunto talvez, estou tentando lembrar da primeira reunião nossa, acho que eu lembro que a gente discutiu quando, primeiro os números que você mandou, aquela evolução histórica, etc. Tinha uma coisa que chamava a atenção ali, volta que você falou, acho que à medida que a receita crescia, as margens não necessariamente estavam crescendo juntos e era muito ainda o overhead que estava crescendo, se bem me lembro. Quer dizer, não é nem tanto o custo da operação, o overhead talvez seja uma questão de uma estruturação mínima que não aconteceu ainda. É aí, né? Você lembra desse... É, é. Isso é um bom ponto, você também comentou, né? E a Raquel bate bastante nesse ponto. A gente pega por ter deficiência. Tem duas coisas, né? A gente cresceu overhead porque funções que nós tínhamos passamos a ter, por exemplo, a gente não tinha uma área de compras, a gente não tinha uma área de marketing, de comunicação, a área de TI também era muito pequena, cyber-ataque, tem que estruturar. Então tem um crescimento do overhead por causa de funções, Por exemplo, a gente não tem uma área jurídica, a gente terceiriza toda a nossa relação com os escritórios. A gente separa de uma área, a gente tem que internalizar. Então, existe uma estrutura mínima que a gente tem que construir, correto? Por exemplo, políticas. Falar mais básico, por todo respeito, há 10 anos atrás a gente não tinha a mínima condição de contratar pessoas como a Raquel ou a Alexandra. Contratava o Edson, mas não contratava a Raquel ou a Alexandra. Desculpa, mas o meu grande custo de vocês deve ser trabalhista, né? Jurídico assim é um grande custo, é muito trabalhista, deve ser, né? Tem gosto. Tem gosto. Vocês estão a voto para o escritório de jogo? Às vezes vale a pena. Às vezes internalizar algumas coisas e deixar e deixar como externa só para consultoria, para casos assim, mais complicados. Um ligopinho... É, a demanda de contratos é muito grande. Mas depende da área. Jurídico, porque é muito diverso. A gente tem seis escritórios, um trabalhista, um tributário que é o viseiro. Isso não vai mudar. Então a gente precisa pensar bem que tipo de recurso interno teria, porque é double-cost. E todos os outros é assim, né? Agora, tem uma coisa que eu penso que é um pouco arrojado, que é a terceirização da folha. Acho que o Edson e a Fabiola não concordam tanto. Mas hoje eu faço tudo caseiro, eu faço aqui dentro. Então, eu tenho aí 10 pessoas fazendo folha. E à medida que eu vou crescendo... Ah, é um paradigma, porque talvez na ponta do lápis hoje é mais caro, mas e isso no longo prazo? E aí eu aloco esses recursos de RH pra... então assim... Você defende o CN House ou você... Não, defendo o terceirizado. Porque eu sei que custa mais caro hoje, mas isso pode trazer benefício na frente, e eu usar os recursos de RH de uma forma mais inteligente. É um exemplo, tem vários exemplos, só que assim, a gestão de BP não tá dentro das BUS e eu acho que nem deve estar, né? Antes de eu pensar em terceirizar ou de fazer em pausa, eu buscaria a forma de otimizar essas... Os recursos. É, porque com a forma mais automática do fechamento de foro. Isso, mas vocês são seis secretários de democracia? Pra assunto, a gente tem seis. Diferentes, cada um tem um assunto. Mas é muito caro, hein? Não sei se você... Mas é esporte. É esporte. É esporte. Não tem fixo. Esporte. Não, mas aí... É melhor. Contrata mais caro, eu acho, gente. Não, mas a gente paga por utilização. Então, quem é um carinha não precisa comprar... Eu não acho que é... A gente pode olhar, tem... Qual é o valor? Qual é o valor? Mas que tipo de... Eu não tenho esse valor aqui. Então, vou contar. Mas que tipo de... Eu não tenho esse valor aqui. Mas que tipo de... Se você dá duro no escritório, é capaz que fique mais curado. É, mas eu queria voltar um pouquinho ao Sander, que o nosso custo de overhead cresceu porque a gente precisa estruturar. Está, tá claro, né? Nós estamos em turning points, uma coisa é uma empresa de um bilhão de reais, já tem estruturado, a gente não tem uma série de funções internalizadas que a gente talvez tenha investimento, inclusive, em TI, né? Sofremos um cyber atalho, isso trigou uma série de investimentos em pessoas, Isso é uma coisa. Isso é um tipo de crescimento que ele é inerente, ele faz parte. Agora, tem uma outra parte que é a questão da produtividade. Isso eu gostaria de fazer um deep dive junto com os senhores, porque, assim, a gente conversa hoje, com todo o respeito, é muito fraco, é muito fraco. Mas conseguimos, bom, eu e eu, né, mas a gente ainda não tem, eu tenho certeza que a Raquel e os best-sellingers são os melhores fits, tanto em termos de custo de retorno e de cultura de trabalho. A gente precisa dar conta da diversidade básica aqui? É, então, essas coisas tem que fazer. Não, sabe o que é? É básica assim, é sempre promocionável. A diversidade de mão de obra. É básica. Você senta ou marcha, né? Marcha, sabe por quê? Porque, assim, isso é uma questão um pouquinho operacional, mas acho que já chegou a ser estratégico, já chega a ser estratégico. Sabe, a nossa mão de obra é muito ruim, é muito ruim. E aí você não está falando não só da operacional, falando geral. Geral, não é. Não é, não é, não é todo mundo, tá? Pra onde eu estou falando. Não, não, mas ok, é a percepção. A produtividade, porque a produtividade é assim, uma coisa é você receber uma caixa no armazém, descarregar, colocar no porta-papel e botar no sistema. E essa é mensurável, né? Essa é mensurável. Agora, o processo do Alexander, por exemplo, o vendedor vai lá, ele conversa, ele pega a ordem, ele puxa, ele faz o embarque, tem que fazer o forró, tem que fazer o embarque, depois tem que fazer o pagamento, tem que calcular a variável cambial, registrar tudo isso. É incrível. Isso não ajuda que eu preciso dos processos operacionais de vocês. Por quê? Eu acho que a gente é muito ruim, é muito ruim. Isso porque a gente ainda é melhor do que o mercado em termos de atendimento. É impressionante como... Isso tem a ver com o acordo de Foz, que depois a gente vai entrar um pouquinho mais. Tem a ver com o fluxo... Vou dar um exemplo típico. Nós tivemos, a mês passada, um embarque, tinha um cliente, eu contei, porque eu fui encopiado, foram... 160 mensagens. Uma cadeia de 160 mensagens. Resultado, o cliente não embarcou com a gente, nós pagamos uma multa de 5 mil dólares. Então foram 160 mensagens, eu não imagino quanto tempo cada um escreveu. E qual que era o tema? Qual que era o... Era o embarque. Não, não, mas por que 160 mensagens? O que que era? Alguma coisa pegou. É, porque era uma questão de licença de exportação, porque era um produto refrigerado, e patinamos se era refrigerado ou não era refrigerado, o que tinha que fazer no refrigerado, e não foi refrigerado, então o cliente recebeu, mas não quis pagar. Isso é um pouco de cultura e modelo de gestão, que você podia pegar o telefone e botar todo mundo no ar. 5 minutos, resolvia tudo, né? Entendeu? Então, essa cultura de que escrever e ler e-mail é trabalhar. Isso é, você precisa tomar cuidado. Nós não somos pagos para ler e escrever e-mail, nós somos pagos para resolver, só que já tem uma cultura de que o e-mail... Eu já vi pra fazer o e-mail, fez a função, fez o trabalho dele. Eu mandei e-mail, a função fez o trabalho dele. Eu mandei ele, eu já fiz o trabalho dele. Isso tudo eu acho que resume na accountability individual. Então, o cara que tá fazendo 30 e-mails, tá tendo uma baita perda de tempo, tá tendo perda de custo, não tá contribuindo pro resultado da emprega. E assim, todo o mindset da empresa tem que ser para a produtividade, para o resultado. Eu sou uma analista de RH. Qual que é a minha produtividade diária para ajudar as B1s a ter um melhor resultado? Eu sou uma analista financeira, sou uma analista de qualidade, pura idade. Então, acho que falta um pouco essa accountability geral. A gente começou a ter fóruns de discussão pesados em relação ao resultado de CL que envolve todas as áreas. Aí veio o menino de H1 de administração. Ok, vamos mudar o modelo de carro para esses dois aqui alugados e economizamos 10 mil reais. Pronto, é isso. É isso, mais sério. E a gente precisa pressionar ainda para que as pessoas pensem dessa forma. Isso ainda não é natural. Acho que esse é o ponto de desenvolvimento de todo dia. Mais uma pergunta aí, sem dúvida nenhuma, cultura, mindset é importante, mas normalmente também tem uma questãozinha de processo aí, né? Quer dizer, como que é trocado, qual que é o processo de aprovação, por quanto as pessoas têm que passar um embarque antes de colocar, quanto que as informações são segmentadas. Essa é a pergunta, não sei. É a pessoa que tem alguns serviços, né, de comunicação, a gente está trabalhando nessa parte cultural. E creio também, Fabiana, que em logística, embora o modelo ideal seja commodity, compra vindo e embarca, a quantidade de imprevistos no meio do processo é muito grande, é muito grande, é impressionante. E eu acho que a gente patina, mudou uma vírgula, o pessoal se desinverte, então. E aí, eu concordo que o processo, não sei, eu acho que processos, processos, eu vou pensar um pouquinho. Assim, até pra ser justo, eu não deixaria só no mindset, que às vezes tem coisa que... É... A forma... É... Sei lá, por exemplo, pra mim soa... Eu entendi, mas não tem nada a ver com o que a gente tá falando. Todo processo de aprovação, projeto a projeto, passar... Não tô dizendo que seja uma coisa que dê pra mudar. Chama atenção, né? Mas não é isso que nos onera, eu acho que tem outras questões. Eu volto nesse ponto, acho que a grande mudança cultural pra passar no meu ponto de vista é essa questão do comprometimento. Todo mundo... Não é força pessoa. Exatamente, essa área, Fabián, que a gente serviça, o hospital, por exemplo, não é do nosso. Começaram a usar RPA, por exemplo, para fazer a recepção de IPA. Todos utilizaram. E pra gente receber carteirinho, você oou lá, né? Aparentemente, ia melhorar, né? E não dá, ficou a mesma porcaria em todos os hospitais, em todos os hospitais de São Paulo, no Brasil, né? Porque fica um imprevisto, fica um imprevisto, não tem jeito, o cara chega lá, às vezes o cara tá passando mal, vai na cadeira, tem que alguém resolver lá. Às vezes a carteirinha tá com número diferente, não passa, o cara tem que chegar e resolver. Isso depende muito, não tem jeito, depende muito da pessoa que está na hora lá. Tem gente que resolve rápido, agora tem gente que fica 10 horas para resolver. E aí, é um assunto de RH, não sei se o Fabiano, você tem um certo fantástico de organização. Assim, fazer um, não sei se existe diagnóstico, se não existe benchmark, a gente sabe, veio da HP, se vende telecom também, com todo respeito, na HP eu conseguia conversar com as pessoas, já faz 20 anos, então eu também era... Você conversa e é gostoso. Mercado de logística, em geral, é um mercado em que a mão de obra, o cara não conseguiu ir para HP, não conseguiu ir para Apple, não conseguiu ir para... Logística tem um perfil de gente que era transportadora, então, perfil como Raquel, Alexandre, sei lá, é raro, é raro. E isso é uma questão estratégica para pensar, porque... não vou treinar, mas de onde vou trazer? Mas eu não pago o suficiente pra isso, não sei se dá pra fazer um diagnóstico de todos os níveis, tudo, não sei, deve existir alguma coisa pra gente fazer esse trabalho. Mas, Manoel, assim, sim dá pra fazer, mas eu acho que é, é só a gente tomar cuidado, essa é uma das alavancas, né, essa aqui a gente fala, ok, produtividade, mindset, etc. Tem algumas questões de negócio. Tem que juntar todos os pedaços pra conseguir priorizar quais que atacam primeiro, né? Mas dá, tem pra fazer. Só acho isso, assim, só tem que tomar cuidado porque normalmente mistura as duas coisas. Às vezes, sim, tem questão de cultura, tem questão de perfil das pessoas, mas às vezes a gente também não ajuda com os processos que a gente tem. Eu não tô falando nada da IU, sempre que eu não conheço. Eu não sei como que é, mas muitas vezes você não favorece que a pessoa ajude, aja de uma maneira mais ligada. Falando genericamente, tá? Não sei, não sei se conhece. A gente tem o próprio perfil, o próprio negócio. Porque a gente tem um problema, a que sempre falo para o Edson, não necessariamente quem atende o IFL vai ser eficiente em atender o CL e vice-versa. E como são áreas comuns, é muito inítilo isso. Tem gente que tem mais perfil para um, tem gente que tem mais perfil para outro. Mas essa questão com a despontorização dos e-mailsmails é algo maior, eu acho que é comportamental. E mesmo que não seja só comportamental, é modelo de gestão também de vocês. Porque alguém estava lá copiado, alguém mais cem, estava copiado nesses e-mails e não tomou atitude, entendeu? Para, vamos botar todo mundo aqui pra conversar e vamos resolver isso. Sim, pode ser. É verdade. Também. Você é concordante. Não é processo. De um outro nível. É, de um outro nível, mas é... Você tá excedendo o caminho do RP, do Piaxima, uma hora que a pessoa vai ter que resolver. Não vai ser processo, não vai... Eu ajudo a processar, tipo, a única coisa. Mas uma hora que mas tem que resolver. É que o e-mail também, o e-mail vem de regra, é mais para over arrest do que para resolver. Vou registrar aqui por e-mail. Antes de a gente fazer uma intervalinha, eu queria fechar a explicação e mostrar um pouquinho para onde a gente vem então a EFF... mas foi boa a conversa que levantou bastante coisa para a gente deixar na lista é muito bom queria só olhar o total agora só para a gente... total para dar um cheirinho para onde a gente gostaria de ir então no total aqui é a planilha lá embaixo, Sales Revenue, 98, 110. Em Actual 2022, a gente foi para 184. Actual 2022, 184. Isso aqui é bruto, então, grossa, a gente deve ter feito 200 milhões. E a gente sempre teve o sonho de ser uma empresa de 200 milhões de reais. É um turning point. Só que isso está inflado por causa do FED. Então, o Actual 2023 deve ficar em 142, 150 milhões. 150 milhões. O Budget 2024 já está em 157. E o expected, que é o 10, ele já está... O 10 é o Debit Equity Swap, é o plano de negócios, eu chamo de 10, a gente chama de 10 porque é o plano de negócios que foi aprovado para se fazer o 10. Mas isso foi aprovado quando, Midaldo? 2019. Quando a gente aprovou o... Era o budget em 2019. Isso, isso. E aí 157 em 2024. As margens com o OP2 de 2,5%, né? E aí tem o expected aqui que isso já está defasado. com um OP2 de 2,5%, né? E aí tem o expected aqui que isso já está defasado. Então, qual que é uma visão, né? Pra gente deixar essa pulguinha. Crescendo 10% ao ano, crescendo 10% ao ano, em 2027 a gente faz 210 milhões net líquido então, se a gente considerar bruto, em 2026 a gente volta a fazer 200 milhões, se continuar crescendo, se fizer crescimento de 10% ao ano. E aí, a margem é 2,5% o ano que vem, mas a gente tem aquela visão de fazer 5%, né? Isso é uma ajuda do Marçal, o Marçal fala, né? O que é 5%? O que é ROE, é OP2, é EBITDA? Isso a gente precisa definir. Mas, a gente conjuntamente trabalhar com essa visão, e isso é mais interno nosso, né? Talvez antes não referiria em budget budget, mas onde a gente quer chegar. E aí sim a gente quer ver, revisar o nosso plano de negócios, o modelo de negócios do Canvas, a gente olha o S&S, com o S&S, com o S&S nós vamos chegar no que a gente precisa fazer no to be pra... Se você ficar em 150 este ano... Ano que vem. Ah, bom, esse ano, tá. Você não vai ter crescimento nenhum neto de inflação, né? Então, esse é outro ponto. Um ponto. Mas a inflação é muito complicada de... Claro. É. Mas, mas eu concordo com você que financeiramente, investidor, ele quer saber isso. Ele quer saber em reais quanto você... É, vai ter que ser em volume, porque... Eu acho que adivinhar é difícil, porque eu não penso ensino para adivinhar, mas como eu já estou na idade, eu estou adivinhando tudo. Na minha opinião, o caminho bacana é pelo menos os 20% do que é. Deve que 10% é o caminho bacana. Mas tem que ser no volume. É, então a gente tem que abrir receita em volume e preço aqui, senão a gente vai ficar sempre falando... Porque eu tenho muito problema com indicador, que francamente, que a gente coloca o número, o número é indicador, mas a gente já começa a dizer, não, mas isso pra mim não significa muito. Se não significa muito, eu tenho que olhar o que significa, senão eu perco totalmente a referência. E aí não serve. Isso, isso. é justamente a referência. É inocente. A compensação da economia é que não está projetando em mil por cento. Eu acho que vai aparecer em 2,5. Vai chegar até 3 ano que vem. Fim. Então eu acho que ano que vem tem oportunidade de conseguir volume. Tem votação. Agora, além das oportunidades também, aí é uma impressão, eu tinha que fazer os números aqui, mas mesmo que a gente mantivesse esse crescimento daqui pra frente, para os próximos cinco anos, será que isso aqui significa que a gente está no mesmo lugar ou está perdendo o market share ou está ganhando? A impressão que dá, mas é por impressãoão, pelo menos para esses próximos 5 anos a partir do que tá aqui em 2024. Se juntar as expectativas de crescimento e tal, talvez eu esteja perdendo até. Acho que é outro... Não muda nada, é só um incentivo a mais para o que vem. Tem que procurar algumas... Não podemos nos contar, tem que voltar ao sonho, né? Dos 200 ou 200 e alguma coisa. Hum, hum. É. É, isso é um ótimo ponto, assim, hum... E, e, e, isso é uma, um dos grandes outputs que eu gostaria que a gente tirasse dessa nossa discussão. Onde queremos estar? Não é possível, é possível, é agressivo, mas é, eu fico assim, em búrgula, porque vai ter esse negócio em cima de Mark Shea, né? Que é a conversa de coisas, né? Aquela vez eu, a conversa que eu fiz também, né, tem uma empresa aqui, que o Mitsutia é consult consultor, é meu amigo, é meu conselho, que a Mitsui comprou ela. E ele falou uma coisa, porque ele foi presidente da Mitsui, no Brasil, nos EUA, e ele falou a diferença de empregado, de executivo e de empresário. É, porque é uma empresa grande aqui, dentro de São Paulo, fatura 3,5 bilhões, mas ela tem um dono, é de família. Agora a Mitsui comprou uma parte dela. Então, teve um ano antes que foi ano passado, tinha o budget e eles ficaram acho que 15, 10% abaixo, receitas. Aí ele falou, o instinto dele, como executivo, o executivo, na hora do conselho, ele apresentar, ele falou que o mercado caiu, teve pandemia, teve um problema de quantidade de preço, não sei o que, e apresentava lá pro dono. A reação do dono com a empresa dele foi diferente. Ele falou, a gente é empresa grande, mas a gente tem 20% do mercado. Ele falou, tem mais 80% pra gente em cima. A cabeça dele é diferente, né? Aí ele falou, aí eu vi bem a diferença entre o meu, que eu executivo a vida inteira, e a cabeça de um empresário, né? Que é dono do meu negócio, né? Que o dinheiro é dele. Então, talvez assim, você pode estar pensando meio-termo, pelo menos que você está agressivo como sujeito, mas talvez a mente, uma coisa ruim, talvez você não seja muito grande, mas uma coisa boa, talvez você tenha espaço para crescer. Eu acho que, assim, francamente, eu gosto de colocar planos de curto prazo acessíveis, executáveis, execuíveis. Eu gosto de colocar planos de longo prazo bem ambiciosos. Você tem que buscar a resposta no meio do caminho, como é que você vai fazer diferente. Um modelo de negócio, que nada disso, tudo isso que a gente está falando aqui, pra gente entender melhor, é tudo incremental. Não tem mudança no modelo de negócio, não tem aquisição de uma empresa. Eu acho que se a gente ficar aqui, nós, a gente não vai ter feito o nosso trabalho. A gente tinha que achar um jeito disso para 300, 400 milhões. Então, esse é o plano que eu falei para a gente. Grande. Se a gente fosse dono mesmo, dono quer pensar em 400, 500 milhões, para vender a empresa um dia, se aposentar ou deixar para o filho dele. Eu acho que é o plano que a gente conversou sempre, talvez a gente vai chegar num preço orgânico muito agressivo, 200, 200 e pouco, aí você compensa a toa que fazer uma aquisição aqui, porque tem muita empresa venda aqui também. Aí sim, a gente pode ir para o próximo, para chegar com as 500, mas só com uma aquisição aqui, mas para isso tem que sair de R150,00 para talvez para R200,00, um pouco aumentando a margem, talvez chegando a uma margem um pouco maior. Aí hoje eu acomodo com outro óleo isso aqui. Eu não sei como é que a Alexandre e a Raquel pensam, por que que eu gosto da conversa? Porque, assim, eu acho que nós, como executivos, a gente é exatamente isso, sabe? Como executivo, qual que é o budget do... tá bom, então, o Camuto, qual que é o budget? Tá, o cara não enche o saco, tudo bem. Já é difícil, entregar o pote é uma tarefa muito difícil. Mas acho que a gente é um pouquinho mais do que isso, e a gente é um pouquinho mais management do que isso, e algumas pessoas ficavam falando mal de Tote, mas é só puxar pouco e o pessoal é muito fraco. Esse tipo de discussão a gente não consegue ter com o nosso management, infelizmente. Eu, particularmente, acho que essa é uma reunião que a gente se puxar, sair do fundo da zona de conforto. Se a gente vai fazer, não vai fazer, isso é uma discussão do bordo. Mas acho que a gente tem que se desafiar. Você não acreditou que a chegada de 150 a 200 em 3 anos... O que? De 150 milhões para 200 milhões em 3 anos... Mas é 10% por ano de taxa. Eu acho factível. Não, não tem nada agressivo nisso. E 200 considerando a inflação, que é 6%. A inflação não reflete imediato. Mas vai ter que crescer em quantidade 5%. E eu acho que é exatamente esse o objetivo desse processo. A gente se desafia a saber. Mas alguma coisa que tenha sentido também. Não é um chute. Você pode fazer um orgânico e um inorgânico Pode ter um objetivo inorgânico Você pode levar lá pro... Cara, eles vão gostar muito de ver, sabe por quê? Tem uma coisa também aí que eu vou... Vocês três são os líderes da empresa, né? Eu acho que é assim A mesma coisa que às vezes vocês tem com as pessoas daqui Eu também tenho relação com vocês também. Assim, ó... Os caras também vêm aqui, acham... Também não me propõem nada de diferente. É, é isso. Verdade. Porque eles não estão lá longe. Quem tem que olhar pra mim, vocês são os donos do negócio local. Eles estão esperando, talvez. Você tem que receber 10 não, aí você fala, pô, é mesmo, não tem jeito aqui. Mas até, por enquanto, você tá no meu... Cara, cadê as empresas que vocês compraram? Pra multiplicar o teu processo, pra aumentar, pra ficar mais... Você não pode falar, mas eu e Ticoco, uma agência de CNT, não posso falar. Você tá superestimando o japonês, mas tudo bem. Quero pouquinho, quero pouquinho, quero pouquinho. Tô superesperando. Ele não está esperando nada? Quando você fala de uma cultura como a nossa, é um pouquinho diferente. Eu entendo o teu ponto, mas isso vai muito na empresa americana, não vai. O japonês, ele é santo neve, é ver pra crer. Se a gente não reverter nossa ação financeira, os Estados Unidos acabaram de fazer um baita M&A. Mas o que que é? Os Estados Unidos estavam maravilhosos por 5 anos, estavam. Por causa do CEL, né, a gente sabe, mas tá. Então foram lá comprar uma empresa do CEL. Agora, eu mirar hoje na situação que a gente está, pelo Japão, a Edson me conhece de verdade. Falaram, vamos comprar uma empresa, eu falei, filho, resolve isso aqui comigo. Posso, posso, posso... Você veio falar de complicadas posso fazer um big phone? um pouco realista eu não sei se eu concordo, é tudo a forma como você como você mostra se você fizesse a clastrização e a segregação, diversos negócios e mostrar pra ele, eu tenho 6 negócios ou tipos de negócios dois andam muito bem exemplo, eu estou quebrando, segmentando, quatro, ó, é o negócio que eu quero sair, tá vendo aqui que eu quero avançar pra isso, pra Forpiel, por exemplo, Forpiel tá dando dinheiro, o meu dá dinheiro, eu sei fazer Forpiel, então vou comprar uma empresa de Forpiel, talvez seja um discurso conveniente, entendeu? Um discurso conveniente de sair em dinheiro. >>[AF]: Não, porque assim, por exemplo, segmentaral que é, pra alavancar, é comprar uma empresa. A não ser que a gente vá pegando os pequenininhos, cada ano... — Então, você pega um pequenininho e mostra que é bom. Ó, o healthcare no Brasil é bom, tá vendo? Pega dois bons, ó... — Eu acho que eles vão olhar e não dizer nada assim, você acha? — É... é difícil. E, principalmente, o ponto que o Marcelo é importante. Baseado no nosso histórico, a gente normalmente não entrega o que promete. Exato. E tem o problema também, que acho que você sempre fala, o problema de... porque o Japonês é uma ilha, você entendesse, né? O Japonês é prazer semelhante a uma ilha. Então, pra eles, a região deles é pacífica, não tem jeito, né? Então, os Estados Unidos é estratégico pra eles, o negócio é geopolítico, China é geopolítico, Chile é, até Peru é mais que a gente. Aqui a gente vai jogar, no Brasil vai jogar. Então, você tem que mostrar algo muito assim, assim, grande, pra eles se... tem petróleo, por exemplo, tem petróleo, todo mundo veio aqui, né, foi um negócio grande, teve depressão, né. Então, você tem carro, começou a crescer aqui, eles vieram aqui com a tropeça, os carros, né? Então, quando você mostra um negócio assim, aí eles olham pra cá, mas naturalmente eles não olham pro Brasil. É muito difícil. Então, gente, mas eu... sem desmerecer as diferenças culturais aí, assim, você mencionou os alemães, né? Eu tenho meus alemães também lá, tem outro conselho que eu participo e é tão semelhante a situação, é tão semelhante porque é... assim, não muda, ah, vocês não estão entregando ainda? essa parte não muda, qualquer lugar do mundo o pessoal vai falar, olha, entrega entrega primeiro, vamos discutir, ok, você tem um ponto aí e acontece aqui e acontece lá com os alemães, que é a mesma situaçãozinha. Mas, tem outra questão que é, eu não sei qual que é a proporção aqui. Lá o negócio é 5% do negócio mundial, mais ou menos. 5, um pouquinho mais. Então, ou seja, é pequeno em relação ao grupo todo, que eu acho que é uma situação que vocês passam também. Isso, na verdade, só aumenta o desafio de propor coisas mais ousadas, mais aliás, porque senão não vai ter atenção mesmo. Se é o tocar o negócio como se toca no dia a dia, não vai ter atenção. E aliás, e aí é... e os executivos também não terão atenção. Porque é isso, quer dizer, se você não consegue colocar, lá tem uma situação assim, o pessoal da Índia tá... a Índia é matreira, né? Eles tão lá, tão agressivos, tão falando, vamos centralizar, os caras tão conseguindo puxar o investimento, e é uma mistura, não é só o resultado, é também ter a ousadia de propor, tem que entregar tem que entregar o resultado verdade mas cuidado é isso que eu recomendaria seguinte a gente está falando aqui de um plano de cinco anos de dez anos então você que você não está fazendo aquisição agora tem ainda uns dois três anos aí de estabilização mas onde que a gente quer entrar como que está expor até porque para chegar no ponto de fazer uma aquisição poder fazer uma uma boa integração e tal, talvez tenha um monte de tarefa de casa que tem que fazer, né? De repente com as questões culturais que vocês falaram, não dá pra fazer uma aquisição esse ano, mas sei lá, talvez daqui a um ano, dois, só que um ano, dois, passa muito rápido. Se não tivesse esses planos, essas coisas não acontecem. Então, acho que a mensagem é só o seguinte, sim, tem a questão japonesa reconheço verdade mas não é tão diferente assim até dos dos alemães lá tá é pra vocês acho que tem desafio de conseguir atenção então tem que ter um certo grau de ousadia e ter que entregar o resultado não elimina a necessidade de fazer um plano com o horizonte um pouquinho maior é juntar tudo isso equ equilibrado, claro, mas eu acho que tem espaço, tem que pensar e tem que ter espaço para esses desafios. Eu gosto de fazer minha incofal, eu acho que, não sei, é questão sua, né, tipo, interna da empresa, também chegar assim, eu acho que é uma riscada também, mas ficou boa assim, sabe, tem um plano aqui de três anos, chegar a 200, mas não é sobre dar muita margem, né. Aí, quem sabe, depois de três anos, fazer uma aquisição, levar o cara, e se ela for para a Tóquio... Aí eles vão preparar, e se der nada, eles vão ficar pelo menos registrados, eles vão ficar esperando pelo menos. Ela chegar agora e falar que vai comprar, de momento, eles já fizeram, mas se fizer isso, daqui a 3 anos, vai chegar a 200, 300 e pouco. Mas vocês teriam autorização para, às vezes, conversar com empresas? Não vai comprar ninguém, porque às vezes só isso ajuda a entender o mercado, ajuda a conhecer, pegar algumas dicas, entendeu? E aí você começa a prospectar, abre a cabeça, né? Obviamente tem que ficar restrito a pessoas... O Alexandre e a Nathalia chegaram a conversar. Podemos fazer mais disso. Mas acho que precisa definir também o segmento, né? É isso. Vai tentar no X. Isso. Eu acho que sair daqui também, né? Sair daqui, sair daqui. Primeiro, você está da estratégia, né? Sair daqui também. Se for de logística, se vai ser de uma logística especializada, se vai ser... bounded, enfim, precisa definir. O que você faria? Assim, no meu plano, no médio, longo prazo, eu penso em comprar uma empresa de logística de healthcare. Existem pequenas e médias, né? Mas isso transferia justamente no médio pra frente, tá até lá, né? Começar fazendo infraestrutura e mover para o M&A de healthcare. Foi, por exemplo, alguns países estão fazendo isso, fora, mas obviamente já estão estabilizados financeiramente. Para a CL, eu penso isso. Mas a gente chegou a ver, muito ano passando, a empresa de logística que tinha também o healthcare, mas tem outro segmento, então, só vai dar. E não é a CL. É, a CL é a proteção. Em relação à aquisição? É. Vale a pena ter esse sonho? É um objetivo? Eu, particularmente, acho que em relação à trade for order em si, eu não vislumbro aquisições. Dispensante, transportador e transportadora doviária. Eu, ainda que com inúmeras dificuldades, eu acho que tem possibilidade de crescimento. O despachante, o agente de carga é muito atrelado a... Você compra a empresa, não significa que você compra os negócios. No mês seguinte, você pode perder o crédito. É verdade. É verdade. Então, eu não acho... E se tivesse uma outra e os tem igual? Se eu comprar globalmente é diferente. Você pega os contratos. Porque aí você pega os contratos globais. Nós estamos falando de Brasil. Entendi. Se você comprar uma empresa no Brasil que seja só a subsidiária brasileira, você vai perder os contratos globais. Tá, deixa eu ler. Ou se você comprar uma empresa brasileira, no dia seguinte um dos donos sai, abre uma ou outras empresas, absorve os clientes rapidamente. E algo ligado a tecnologia? Pensando na forma de negociar, de conseguir os clientes, de... pra cotar mais rápido, de fazer um... Entende? Tu pensou em qual? Quer dizer, o modelo modelo para te ajudar a... Para conseguir o... eu acredito que a tecnologia, você não precisa comprar uma empresa, mas investir na tecnologia... Investir na tecnologia. Sim, não vai sobrar de dúvida. A iniciação que a gente conversou com você e com o Raquel, sobre a dificuldade, quando você estava fora, a gente ia perguntar, né? Qual seria a dificuldade que você vê na sua área para crescer mais? Tanto nas duas coisas, tanto no esporte quanto nesse controle mais de... De curto prazo, as maiores dificuldades são pessoas, a gente não consegue encontrar pessoas boas, não consegue reter pessoas boas, tem muitas dificuldades de pessoas e relacionamento com contas globais. Que a nossa empresa não sabe fazer, não é boa e não faz. Perfeito. Eu sugiro agora, falando aqui, assim, não fechamos, mas a gente tem uma ideia para onde nós queremos ir. Agora, eu sugiro a gente fazer um intervalinho de 10 minutos, e depois a gente voltar, e eu queria falar um pouquinho do Canvas. Como eu enxergo hoje, né, valendo com o Alexandre e com o Raquel, para a gente ter um pouquinho mais claro o nosso modelo de negócios, um pouquinho mais simplificado, mais pragmático, e aí a gente olhar e começar a discutir o to be, e o to be, aí vai refletir, com esse to be não tem sonho, para esse sonho precisamos ajustar o to be. Semana que vem vocês vão estar fora? Os três? Eu vou estar aqui, mas... É? Você também? Eu tô com a agenda bem... Eu tô fazendo férias, dez dias. E tem a viagem dele. Eu vou ficar janeiro, bastante tempo. Eu tava com uma hipótese aqui. Não, mas eu tô pra ir. Antes de entender, eu vou te falar o que que é. É de mergulhar num cliente, num exemplo, num negócio, entendeu? A gente fez um caminho assim, ágil, entrando bem lá, depois a ideia de entrar um pouco e... viver um pouco o teu negócio. A gente tem uns números por cliente, por conta do caso, sérios e... Visualizar mesmo, operação, entendeu? Mas, pode ser bem bom. Vamos fazer um breakzinho 11h10 um pouquinho mais de 10 minutos é pouco? acho que você está dando folga para a gente 10 minutos onde que é o banheiro aqui? Logo aqui na frente. Aqui a esquerda, tá. Os dois do fundo. A empresa tá naquele ponto lá, difícil, né? Porque ou... Do ponto do salto. É, né? Porque ou você corta custo, ou você começa a investir pra ter prejuízo no novo prato e tá crescendo o médio, né? É. Eu não vejo... Eu não tenho tempo deo de custo... Eu tentei fazer duas, quatro minutos e tem custo de custo. Hoje o custo de custo incremental como solução. O que você pode pensar no modelo de... O custo de custo incremental vai resolver esse problema. Não sei, mas pode. Quando a parte está tão pequena... Depois você passa os custos com a nível agrário. Eu estou achando, por exemplo, se você concentra tudo em um escritório só, mesmo se você pagar por negócio, às vezes é menor, por contrato, você paga aquilo que fazem vários escritórios. É filho, nosso custo é folha. É exatamente, mas é uma negociadora. É folha. Não é curso de sistema, de advogado, de marketing. Tem que olhar, mas se você olha, é 100 vezes maior. Mas às vezes você começa a cortar os velhos, isso dá diferença. Ah, qualquer um também. Mas às vezes não dá para cortar, às vezes você tem razão, às vezes vai dar tanto trabalho para cometer 20 20 mil reais, não vale a pena, sabe? As vezes também não vale a pena. Se for só isso, não vale a pena. Mas não quero ter âncora de concurso, tá? Não quero ter âncora de concurso. Mas a gente precisa melhorar as nossas receitas, arrancando mais... ...um cliente. Tem que forçar o cliente. Mostrando valor. O valor percebido, não e o valor agregado. É isso que a gente tem que... É... Sinto o mercado. Se eles conseguem trazer 20 mais... Aí o pessoal falou e... Nossa, o nota não abaixa. A outra coisa é reduzir custos... Assim... Desculpa... É assustador como a nossa cariógra é ruim. É. Não vale a pena apretar um pouquinho o salário. Por exemplo, ela deu um exemplo, né? Contratar duas mulheres para fazer um de um homem, né? Pode ser. E contratar às vezes um cara para fazer o trabalho de três, por exemplo, pagando uns mil reais a mais. Não vale a pena, né? Esse tipo de discussão que a gente tem, puta, é música, né? Mas eu só consigo fazer com Raquel Colechão. E olha lá, você baixou um pouquinho para a gerente, a lei geral, o nível de discussão... Porque o... Muito. Sabe quanto eles ganham? No gerente. No gerente, depende, mas tem gente, gente, gente... O que o... A quanto eles ganham? No G20? No G20? Depende, mas... Tem gente de 15, 20... Tá, isso aí... Tá tão baixo. Claro que vai ser dinheiro, e dá pra ter gente em um mundo de um... É, é rápido, né? Tá aí... Porra, 15 e 20? Ó, deixa eu falar pra vocês uma coisa que eu tô descobrindo agora. Do... A experiência tá sendo fantástica. Foi um negócio semi-público, né? Então, eu tenho equipe, cresci pra caralho, a gente tá crescendo, tudo, em equipe também. Aí eu descobri um celeiro de recursos, que é... que são as pessoas do serviço público. Tem, os caras são muito bons, tem cara muito bom lá. É muito bom ganhando, não sei, aquele cara, aquele CV. O cara é bom. Se eles tivessem a vida inteira numa empresa privada... A minha esposa é professora de não-mestre lá, né? Então, é o serviço público é tudo igual, eu até me trabalhei em um método brasileiro, assim, né? Eu falo assim, de cada dez caras, tem 8 vagabundos Mas tem 2 que crescem o departamento inteiro, sempre tem É assim no serviço público, sabe? Tem 2 ou 3 que sempre trabalham pra bunda, sabe? São preparados, eles têm o capotar de se preparar Eles olham pro lado e falam assim, p**a que pariu Eu podia ir pra iniciativa privada A iniciativa privada não descobriu ainda esse e você deve ter conto, mas não descobriam. Porque se o Headhunter não pensa, ou a pessoa de RH não conhece... >>[TC]: Tem uma coisa aqui, não é discussão operacional, mas por exemplo, você fala para a pessoa de RH, por exemplo, poupa-tempo, né? Poupa-tempo é o tipo de atendimento que se a gente conseguir se replicar no NEM, no seu 26, então você, claro que é um negócio diferente, mas você entra, aí você tem um assunto, aí você tem uma flechinha azul, aí você segue a flechinha azul, você senta no banco, te chama o número, você entrega, agora você vai, segue na reta azul. É simples, é simples e funcional. E é impressionante como o cara, de um pouco a tempo, parece que ele gosta de atender, sabe? Quando tem esse cara, ele não ganha mais que na iniciativa privada, sabe? Ou no laboratório. É, lá é bastante privada, porque lá é concessão, né? Concessão, mas o cara, eu não sei se aquilo é medido, né? É medido, é medido, é medido, porque o cara que fica abaixo lá daquele negócio, ele é mandado embora, né? Por isso que eles pedem lá o... Por todos os lados, né? Isso, o problema do Fabiano estava falando de processo, mas se todo o processo de aéreo e frete aérea seguisse aquela linha azul... Eu acho que o Fábio tem razão nisso, porque agora o Fábio trabalhou um pouco, porque eu fui hoje na perspectiva do Cines, uma empresa grande agora, está com mais de... para uma empresa de consultoria, está com 150... porra, né? Assim, ele tinha gente, ele faturava pra caralho. Quando você fala mil clientes, você é junto com ele, é isso? É, eu trabalho com ele. Então é assim, a margem deles é muito pequena, 5%. O Nelson, eu sou meio que um CEO lá, eu escrevi pra ele. Ele fez isso, ele transformou aquilo em meio commodity, ele entrou em Porto Amore, em Carola, entrou a entrada em uma só. Aí o cliente que vem entrando, vai caminhando para as áreas que tem lá dentro da perspectiva. Hoje a margem deles está... Hoje a margem deles está 20%. Só de mudança de processo que a noção fez lá dentro. Tipo de pouco a tempo, é meio commodity. Então pode entrar... Porque antes assim, para cada cliente que tinha e entrava, tinha uma porta de entrada diferente um analista percebeu o cara né não precisava entendeu porque geralmente as demandas entravam assim e conforme ia no final ia dividindo né é uma coisa de processo né Andrão, talvez é uma coisa de processo as coisas ficam juntas normalmente é que às vezes a gente em algumas situações a gente subestima a dificuldade que a gente cria para as pessoas para trabalhar direito por vários motivos, por histórico então nem sempre é é isso ai, as vezes além dela é você ta falando do sax do serviço as vezes você pega as vezes até pessoas bem pessoa bem intencional, fala assim, cara, olha, eu entendo, senhor, de verdade, eu não consigo, eu não consigo, eu não tenho acesso, o sistema não me dá uma autorização, me fala que os supervisores não me deixam nem passar, os supervisores se eu passar, eles só tem que... quer dizer, é um negócio louco, né? Então o sistema você liga pra pessoa, ela tem que falar assim, olha, essa informação você tem que colocar no site, pô, o conjunto tudo liga pra você! Quer dizer, é uma coisa louca, é um paradoxo, um profissional! — A gente tá falando de um mercado de produtores de trabalho, por exemplo, eu trabalho de construtor, né, tradicionalmente, com o mercado de commodities, de agrícolas, de café, o que eu estava lá com, deu fim. Assim, corre muito problema, mas é o que você falou, é o que o Saulo falou, é que tem uma área, tem um gerente, é um cara, uma área ele fala, vai ter que fechar agora esse negócio, ou fecha ou abre o negócio. Não pode porque o commodity, porque o preço muda muito, esse preço de cotação de café, de commodities, se o cara o preço muda muito, esse preço de cotação, de café, de comode. Esse cara fica ali rolando muito e ele começa a perder a cotação, fecha errado na curva. Então o cara lida a cabeça já, porque ele tem o prazo de fechar o negócio. Mas isso é um processo, já está introdictado. É um processo de fechamento, quando você faz a cotação ele tem que fechar em tal período ou em quantos passos. Tem que fechar o contrato, se não abre, a gente fala que aí abre, aí abre mão e larga. Agora, é o que você falou, ficar 160 e mais, não deveria. Deveria ter alguém, o líder, o conselho, um gerente que tenha acabado, tem que ter a fita pra fechar, né? Mas eu só vou pensar no comentário do Fabiano, que diz assim, a gente trocou 160 e-mails porque a gente não tinha um processo e que se tivesse seguido o processo teria resolvido o convite ou é realmente o número de imprevistos que acontecem e que fogem do processo e a pessoa... Então, mas se tá acontecendo muito imprevistorevista, isso é uma maneira de combate também. Às vezes tá chovendo... Tá fora do script. Você consegue fechar, mas quando passa muito, então o cara chega e então esse contrato não vale a pena fechar mais. Daí ele encerra. Porque ele não vai mais pra frente, entendeu? Isso tem costas. Tem um contrato que dá muito imprevisto, muito simbolismo... Isso não é noção nossa, já fechou. O imprevisto acontece durante a... Já embarcou. Agora é responsabilidade. Ah, já fechou o negócio. Já fechou. Mas nesse caso você falou que não embarcou, como você fez? Desde os 160 mil... Não embarcou, não embarcou, não embarcou. Embarcou e só tinha chegando o desfile, e ele falou, não, não quero mais. Está estragado. Porque não está refrigerado. Tudo. Na entrega. Qual que era o produto? Puta merda, então ele foi antes, né? Então ele foi antes de embarcar, então. Então o erro foi antes, né? Então o erro foi antes de embarcar. Antes, depois, durante... É imprevisto mesmo, né? Não sei. Pode ser que eu faça o que é imprevisto mesmo. Não sei se... Uma coisa que eu estava pensando também, que é importante pra gente aqui, assim, eu concordo, tem ferramentas pro crescimento e tal, e comprar empresa e tal, mas eu fico pensando aqui assim, de tudo que vocês mandaram pra gente ter agora, o que a gente foi conversando, dá a impressão do seguinte, vocês têm ainda uma visão mais ou menos alinhada do futuro, mas quando cai nos detalhes, tem bastante coisa que precisa ser alinhada. Então, tem coisa que você coloca, que dá pra ver que não é a visão deles ainda, eles têm questões que eles veem, eles colocam e, eu discuto com o Edson, vai rever, assim, pra conseguir chegar no ponto de aplicar, de comprar e ver o que a gente tem que fazer, precisa ainda desse alinhamento, que no final das contas é ter uma visão estratégica consolidada, tudo isso, mas ainda tem um espaço bom aí. É, são muitas coisas cheias. Eu estava pensando mais em visão do que em... no queijo. Acho que tem que começar com a visão mesmo, né? Eu quero ter... eu quero saber quantos... 400 e 500. 200 eu vou fazer organicamente e 300 mais forte. E não se prender necessariamente... Exato. ...com o elório. O dia a dia é difícil. É difícil, sim, mas... organicamente e treinar mais forte. E não se prender necessariamente. Exato. O dia a dia é difícil. É difícil sim, mas... Porque aí a visão, tudo pode começar com uma visão. I have to fucking close this guy. É, por isso que a gente pode jogar mais, a gente não tá aqui. No dia a dia a gente nem... E outra, eu acho que uma das, assim, como estratégia de posicionamento, aí a gente pode pegar, aí é legal pensar, eu quero estar em negócios que me dê margem acima de tanto, e aí eu começo a ter alguns indicadores, que tipos de negócios que eu quero ter, exemplo, estou pensando aqui, eu quero estar em negócios mais ultra sofisticados, você pensa um pouco dele e tal, o tipo de business model que você quer ter. Por exemplo, a Aranea que eu estou vendo é mais problemática, a dela também é, mas ela também não fala muito, mas eu ouço, mas eu sou alumador. A Aranea é complicada por causa disso, ela fica falando um ano, dois anos, o cara vai chegar lá e ela vai fechar o negócio. A gente sabe que isso é natural na pessoa. A Aranea dele, por exemplo, esse clima de dificuldade, será que não vale a pena, por exemplo, pagar mais, ter uma equipe menor e trabalhar onde tem maiores margens, por exemplo, e de vez em quando, esporte com tudo que aparece, mas vamos dizer, esporte naquelas áreas que tem mais margem, por exemplo, aí paga mais, tem uma equipe menor, mas a gente luta, né? Não sei o que você enxerga. Mas mesmo na área aqui em contratos logísticos, me chama a atenção o seguinte, parece que a gente é super seletivo na hora de pegar os contratos, só que ao mesmo tempo a gente está crescendo muito e a margem não está tão boa. Parece meio contraditório essas três coisas. Será que é isso mesmo? Tem também desafios aqui, né? Não, não é. A gente foi amigo da gente, não tem o que a gente pode falar, né? É óbvio, né? Tá na hora já, Neto? É, vamos. Nem foi ao banheiro. Escuta o porra, Neto. Não, não, não. Não pode, né? É, mas isso diz, assim, mas... Não se tirar da área de porquê. Eu enxergo, eu acredito em alguma coisa que eventualmente eu devo rever, né? É só o valor apegado, não é isso? Mas todas essas coisas... Seja desafiado, né? Só, não é 200, né? Por que é 200? Por que é 500? Por quê? Porque você quer, não? Mas aí tem uma coisa que vocês falaram que eu acho que é importante, que é assim, desdobrar essas ações, os números, etc. Porque o diabo está nos detalhes, exato. Então, assim, você pode ter toda uma visão alinhada, onde que vai chegar, etc, mas aí na hora de executar,ar, ah, mas aqui não dá, ou aqui não é isso, ou não tem o espaço para esse crescimento, então acho que a discussão tem que levar ao desdobramento, porque daí relaciona com a realidade, tem um pé na realidade e tem o pé no sonho, tudo bem, pé em duas canuas não é bom, mas precisa ter nesse caso. E o detalhe, quando você conta para a organização lá fora os seus sonhos depois você tem que entregar os seus sonhos não pode ser só um sonho tem esses detalhes né Alexandre depois querem que entregue ainda por cima não é sacanagem aí não tem condições mas aí é um desafio né se for assim tem que se for entregar e se pegar eu vou ter que trabalhar mas eu acho que não é agressivo. Eu brinquei, mas não é agressivo. Tu sente três anos, depois... Mas não é só o que receita, precisa aumentar a margem. Aumentando a margem, pedir autorização para a EMEI, acho que aí vem. Mas, como o Raquel falou, acho que para algumas áreas. Não para uma empresa em grandeira, mas em uma área mais específica, né? Talvez venha a minha autorização, né? Porque o preço que ele vai estar, o dólar, 4, 5, é caralho. Eu vou começar a voltear. Vem aqui, quer comprar? Tchau, cara. Obrigado. Eu vou começar a me juntar. Tá bom, tá bom. É, esse é um bom ponto, viu? Eu vou falar do 10 hoje? Vou falar. Que tá desatualizado. Mas eu não vou dar a meta. Pra contorbar isso que eu falei, nós estamos em 2023, os que tinham o budget foi em 2024, e a primeira premissa foi que no mínimo tem que ser o 10, que foi feito em 2019, antes da pandemia. O mundo mudou muito, pessoal, fazia muito. Porque, de relíquia, a nossa organização tem que ser quase um plano de 10 anos, daqui a 10 anos eles estão te cobrando o mesmo plano. Não, não é o plano. Não, mas daí o que vocês propuseram agora de vamos rever o 10, vamos não sei o que lá, é o caminho, né? É. E daí vão ter novas premissas, pode ser que fique mais agressivo, menos, mas se repactua as premissas. Eu não sei como funciona isso aí, o Atun pode me dar uma... Nós fizemos esse 10 porque a gente ia pedir injeção de capital. Isso. E tinha uma razão por aí. Isso. Para fazer uma renovação, uma atualização, tem que ter outra razão, eu acho. Se não, não precisa fazer. Para que que nós vamos entregar, para que que eles vão ler uma atualização? Porque, quando precisar... Isso é uma... Já está pronto. Hum... Não sei. Isso você pode meter. Mas, qual é o modo desoperante da empresa? A gente apresenta no ano o budget. Se eu vou fazer um plano de negócios de mais tempo, a gente vai falar, por que você vai fazer isso? E a hora que dá outra vez, foi porque nós queríamos uma injeção de capital. Se agora a gente quer fazer um M&A, aí faz sentido. Se você quer fazer algo que não seja recorrente. Não sei se faz sentido simplesmente só, só quis atualizar. Se aquela injeção de capital já foi feita, os livros já estão considerando, ela morreu. Nada diferente disso eles vão respeitar. Mas talvez aqui, aliás, uma afirmação, é uma pergunta, né? Mas vocês não estão vendo oportunidades e desafios novos que não foram vistos lá em 2019? E vocês querem uma... Pra apresentar, a gente tem que ter um contexto. Por que eu estou apresentando? É isso. Eu penso um pouquinho diferente. Eu vou apresentar, eu acho que a gente tem que apresentar exatamente porque a gente tem que apresentar, não porque eles pediram. Porque a gente quer apresentar. É, porque se eu fizer as coisas que eles pediram... Não, talvez eu esteja pensando diferente deles, é difícil saber o que eles... mas eu no lugar deles pergunto, por que você quer fazer isso? Por que você quer cuidar? Porque na cultura japonesa, raramente as coisas vêm de cima para baixo e a gente tem que mostrar para a galera, para a galera que eu vou Você acha que precisa ter um contexto, isso aí? É, acho que não. Não só não precisa, mas como a gente faz as coisas porque eles pedem, melhor a gente fazer antes. Eu não sei nem porque eles pediram, mas aí, o que a gente quer com isso? Independente do que eles querem. Eu entendi. Independente do que eles querem. O que nós queremos com isso? Eu quero mostrar que no Brasil o management tem total controle dos negócios, sabe para onde eles querem, tem um monitor, ele está pensando no futuro. Acho que essa função é nossa, né? Essa é questionamento é bom. Mas o questionamento é bom. Pessoal, é um esboço, tá? Eu fiz... em duas horas, então... não tem nada elaborado. Mas eu achei bacana isso aqui porque de forma pragmática, de forma pragmática, mostra o nosso modelo de negócios. Aqui eu botei S.I.S. Isso aqui é discursivo, tá bom? Discursivo, eu vou dar uma passada, mas gostaria que todo mundo questionasse, etc. E o ponto é o seguinte, com isso, se esse é o nosso modelo de negócio, não vamos chegar naquele número. Não vai, então o que tem que mudar? Mudar o que mudar? mudar só aqui e depois de mudar, começar a colocar números pra quebrar, né? como é que a gente quebra os números pra chegar nesse plano posso deixar umas 3 ou 4 perguntas pra gente ficar com elas na cabeça enquanto se apresenta, né? Quando eu olho isso aqui normalmente, quer dizer, eu tento olhar algumas coisas, mas desse modelo do negócio aqui, quais são as coisas que são de alguma maneira diferencial, que são críticas praquele modelo? O que é que é... modelo não tem bom ou ruim, né? É o modelo, mas quantas dessas coisas são as coisas que a gente depende? Vocês foram mencionando ao longo das conversas das últimas três, né, coisas que me chamam atenção que são diferenciais. Tem o outro pé também, né, que dessas coisas é gargalo, que a gente tem dificuldade, é importante, mas é gargalo. Sei lá, estão falando pessoas, aparece em algum local aqui pessoas, né. Ah, isso aqui é um dos gargalos que a gente tem para atingir os objetivos. Quando fala da proposta de valor, assim, quanto que isso é único e é diferencial, e quanto que isso a gente está ajudando a gente a se posicionar mesmo? E... é basicamente essas três, eu falei quatro, mas são essas três que acho que a gente tem que pensar quando a gente está olhando isso aqui tá eu achei que é um bom começo e tal mas eu achei que eu achei que tá ainda até de momento eu acho que serviria para se eu pegar outras 20 empresas no mundo eu botava o nome que foi feito para ela no Brasil poderia servir para muita empresa, entendeu? Então, parece uma das mais genérias, entendeu? Porque se eu disser assim, ó, isso aqui é para empresas logísticas chinesas, hipster, não sei, qualquer um vai acreditar, porque para muito ainda... Pode ser parecido. Acho que tem que ter um... Acho que tem que descer um nível, eu acho, né? Embora, a gente falou, né? O Alexandre tem duas mil empresas... Dois mil freight forwards no Brasil. E a Raquel tem umas duzentas empresas de logística fazendo uma coisa parecida. Então, é uma discussão profunda. Principalmente... Mas, por exemplo, quando você fala, por exemplo, proposta de valor. Flexibilidade e velocidade de atendimento. Talvez eu possa ser melhor detalhado, entendeu? Porque a gente pode ser vários quando eles se encaixam. Esse é o ponto. — Está aqui a proposta, tá bom. — Tá. — Vamos tentar entender o todo. Primeiro, a gente fala de principais parceiros. Parceiro, eu entendo parceiros de negócios né, parceiros de negócios mais uma vez dividindo dos dois, o Alexandre, os parceiros de negócio chave do Alexandre são os armadores e as empresas aéreas, parceiros de negócios a Raquel, parceiro de negócios são os donos de armazéns tem mais né? tem mais, mas eu coloquei aqui o grosso. Os críticos. Os críticos. Que é o CORE aqui, né? Seria o 80-20, sei lá. E desenvolvedores de sistemas. Tem a ver com a estrutura de custos, mas... E aí, entrando um pouquinho embaixo aqui na estrutura de custos, mas... e aí, entrando um pouquinho embaixo aqui na estrutura de custos, que tem a ver com os principais parceiros. A nossa estrutura de custos é basicamente pessoas, aluguel de armazéns e escritórios e os fretes aéreos, marítimos e rodoviários. Se você cobrir esses custos, você está falando de 90% da nossa estrutura de custos, muito provavelmente. Já vocês gastam por mês quanto de aluguel de alazém? Quanto você gasta por mês? Você sabe até? Não, você precisa falar? Não, já respondi, eu vou ter que estar aqui. Quanto paga de aluguel por mês? Depende, né? A Ianguera, mais ou menos, 380 mil. O Ipo, metade disso, 160. O Cássio, mesma coisa. E... Então, já vai ser mais ou menos 50 mil. 150 e 1 milhão. Perto de 1 milhão. 8 milhões. Quanto mais quadrados? Preço médio por médio quadrado deve estar em São Paulo e Manaus. 21, 22, dependendo da região da região, algumas regiões 27, mas aí agora é um ponto... Nossa, o apartamento. Só uma coisa para não passar batido, um ponto, desenvolvedores de sistemas, por que aí é um parceiro, a cada projeto é feito uma coisa nova ou isso é pra suportar o negócio? Sim, a gente tem um sistema grande que é o gestor de armazém, que é o WMS, e pra cada cliente a gente desenvolve interfaces diferentes e customizadas. Cada cliente tá conectado a nós de uma forma. Claro, tem as básicas e as específicas, né? De acordo com o processo de cada cliente. É isso que é terceirizado. Quando você tiver WMS, você tem um API para acessar o WMS. Exato. E daí tem que configurar esse API para o sistema do... Exato. E nós temos a mesma coisa com o TMS. Tá. O TMS-Port. E isso é... é terceirizado. são parceiros mesmo que tem que fazer... São duas empresas diferentes, inclusive. O WS é Zion, antiga Store. Qual não? Zion. Zion. E a... o TMS ainda tá a Voitcare, que é uma empresa pequena, mas a gente vai mudar. Ficamos uns 5 anos com eles. E os sistemas de AFF são basicamente corporativos, né? Não. O principal é. É, né? Existe um sistema corporativo, mas ele não se aplica muito aqui porque ele é muito focada no Valeiro, Camarata e Esqueio e a questão do armazém geral ele não cobre. Ele não consegue fazer as RCOs. Então isso acabou sendo solução brasileira. É muito melhor. Essa Voit, que a pessoa falou que é pequena, é o mesmo nome da Voit? Voit, a empresa, grande Voit? Não, não, não. É o mesmo nome. Não, é Voit, que é do jeito que fala mesmo. Voit, ah, então. É essa Voit que você está falando é PH, né? É, porque eu tenho uma empresa com o mesmo nome. É um ex-executivo de mercado, que abriu, funcionou por um período, mas na hora que entrou um cliente mais complexo, eles capotaram. Então a gente vai ter que mudar. Mas tudo bem, tem muito software de mercado que dá pra gente substituir. Aí nas atividades, reflete essa questão do sistema. Eu simplifiquei, tá? Qual é a atividade? Falando bem simples. É compra e venda de fretes aéreas, marítimas e motoviais. Mais desembaração da vida. Mais desembaração da vida, desculpa. Mais desembaração da vida. E junto com aodamente, desculpa. Mais desembaraçodamente. E junto com a compra e venda, é o tracking e o tracing. Um pouquinho mais profundo, né? Porque não é só repassar a informação, gente. Tem que tentar fazer acontecer o embarque do jeito que a gente vendeu, mais simplificado. Por isso que o sistema é importante. E na área de série mais simplificada, por isso que o sistema é importante. E na área de série, simplificando, é basicamente, principalmente, controle de inventário, que envolve receber, armazenar, contar, reportar, mas é controle de inventário, seja em armazéns nossos, seja em armazéns de clientes. E ainda não com o que é o 4PL, o transporte, porque aí é uma questão mais de... E aí reflete nos principais recursos, né, mais uma vez. Pessoas... Desculpa, então eu posso ficar te interrompendo pra explicar um pedaço? Claro, claro. Daí quando fala da compra e venda de fretes, etc, a inteligência de mercado lá de prever preços, etc, está embutida aqui nessa atividade de compra, é assim que vocês entendem. Isso aí, isso aí. Às vezes a gente vende antes de comprar, mas... E daí você tem que ter algum parâmetro para... Exato. É mais profundo o work. Vende e depois compra no preço que precisar comprar, por exemplo. E recursos, sem complicar, pessoas, a informação que vem dos nossos parceiros de negócios, dos armazéns, e dentro dos armazéns e equipamentos de movimentação, os sistemas de controle. Esses não são os recursos. E se estamos dando a atenção necessária para cada um desses sistemas, a gente precisa manter o que a gente pensava. Aqui foi desafiador falar proposta de valor, né? Isso aqui tem um pouquinho de passado, mas basicamente... Desculpa, eu tinha que ter uma pergunta toda hora, né? Por favor. Mas, nos recursos, eu fico pensando muito aqui, no quanto eu aplaudi isso, o... sou meio... o conhecimento, quer dizer, como é o processo consultivo, essa base de conhecimento, projetos realizados anteriormente, tecnologia... Eu não sei se eu encaixaria em alguma coisa aqui ou não entendeu mas isso é um ativo importante para você é a vez que a planta que eu gostei eu isso no Isso no AFF também, né? Sem dúvida. Também no AFF? Onde que pega mais para o AFF? Pelo conhecimento do mercado, dos parceiros? Parceiro, mercado, shared. O Alexandre, ele... É diferente de câmera,, mas Alexandre sente se o frete vai subir ou vai descer. Como? Como é? É difícil. Experiência de mercado. Vera ou Ghebreli? Mandina. Sim, sim, sim. Tem uma... Mandina. É Ghebreli, mas... Vera, é isso. É. Consciência. A gente é, é, é, é, é certa é muito maior da que a minha. Mas aí tem outro motivo, né? O dólar ninguém sabe, só que no dia que alguém souber, opera e deixa de saber. É verdade. Não. Quem sabe não fala para os outros. Nós também. Se alguém souber, não fala para os outros. Tirando você que fez a previsão aqui, eu já vou ter que rever meus contratos internacionais. Já me ferrou. Prolegamento você pode saber, mas em curto prazo ninguém sabe. É, mas em curto prazo... Bom, mostramos o nosso propósito-valor, né? Agora a proposta de valor, eu coloquei aqui, flexibilidade e velocidade de atendimento. Por que eu coloquei isso? Uma coisa é o que as empresas falam, né? E a outra é o que as empresas realmente procuram praticar. Eu coloquei aqui porque, realmente porque realmente na Ilson Logistics a gente pratica e esse até hoje talvez tenha sido o único referência nosso de valor. Não sei se era o chefe Raquel que era isso. Se eu fosse cliente, assim, Edson, tem 30 segundos para vender a minha empresa, para ver se eu vou comprar. O que você falaria? Para comprar? Vou comprar serviço. Vou comprar seu serviço. Elevator pitch. Eu tenho 30 segundos dentro do elevador para falar com o cara até chegar no meu lugar. O que você falaria? A proposta de valor da emissão de logística. É para que você tenha conhecimento em logística, realmente uma experiência de cliente, atendimento a cliente na sua função de logística, por um preço competitivo. Você realmente vai ser tratado como cliente. Que você vai receber aço em vez de alumínio. Não só vai receber aço, alumínio vai receber alumínio, mas se você ligar, eu vou atender, se você mandar e-mail... É isso aqui que vai ser a chave, tipo, futuro, proposta de valor. É, eu não ouvi vocês que falarem confiabilidade. Não parece que tá inserido aí no assunto. Que é a parte do alumio, que eu falei. Não, não. Não é atendimento, é... Oi, tudo bem? Eu vou ajudar a resolver um problema e tal. O problema já aconteceu. E flexibilidade é soluções diferentes. Velocidade é soluções rápidas. É possível explorar um pouco isso na imagem de empresas japonesas que tem, né? De confiabilidade. Porque o cara falou pra mim, essa empresa que estava no Brasil, esse cara aí, ia falar, deve ter contratado uma empresa japonesa. Ele falou pra mim, eu falei assim, essa empresa que estava no Brasil, esse cara aí e ele falou, ah, deve ter encontrado uma empresa japonesa, ele falou pra mim É confiabilidade, barra Segurança, barra, certeza de que eu estou Vou receber aquilo que eu estou Que vocês estão comprando Porque é uma coisa o Elevator Pitch pra For For Sale Depois você está lá, o Hunting, o Farming Aí é uma outra coisa. E isso, propositalmente, eu não coloquei no mais isso, porque é um processo, mas assim, claramente, conversando com os clientes, tanto de IFF como de SEL, a confiabilidade passa a ser um diferencial. As caras não têm isso. Talvez parar um pouco essa imagem, talvez. Sabe o que me chamou a atenção aqui? Comparando as coisas que vocês foram falando, de novo, ao longo das conversas, eu estou jogando aqui só para relembrar e ver se deveria aparecer no propósito de valor, tá? Então, por exemplo, em Contact Logistics, falou muito de solution design, de inovação, isso faz parte da proposta de valor, deveria fazer? Porque tem que tomar um cuidado aí, assim, tudo a gente pode dizer que encaixa aqui na flexibilidade e velocidade de atendimento, mas se o solution design e inovação são coisas importantes, talvez tenha preparação maior que a gente tenha que fazer para entregar isso. Só passar, é rapidinho aqui. A proposta de valor tem que ser algo que você faz a mais diferente do que o mercado faz. Porque nós temos de caro 10 concorrentes. O que os 10 fazem que a gente não faz? Que é um diferencial, ok. Solution design e inovação todos tem, mas isso é condição de ser mecanômica, não é o que é o contrário. Que é um diferencial, ok. Solution, design, inovação, todos tem. Mas isso é condição semi-econômica, não é o que você é. Tá, ok. Além disso, o que eu vou fazer? E aí, aqui, eu acho que é muito daí do se entender a dor e trazer uma solução pra dor. Não necessariamente ela vai ser inovativa. Não necessariamente é saldo supersônico. Às vezes é uma mudança de processo. Então, eu acho que... Por que que o atendimento aqui é importante? Porque é você tratar bem o cliente, ser bem, bem, tratar ele como se fosse o único, pra ele poder abrir pra você as dores dele, você ser capaz de desenhar uma solução. Alô, Alô. Queria entrar no assunto. Bom, ter flexibilidade na solução. Não quero confundir, mas no relacionamento com o cliente, no relacionamento com o cliente, eu escrevi aqui. Um ativo, o comercial é ativo e o operacional é ativo. Mas primeiro vamos falar do ativo comercial. Alexandre e Raquel vendem em grandes empresas. DHL, Q&A, SEVA. Os grandes clientes, os grandes, desculpa, os grandes concorrentes, nesses grandes concorrentes, o cliente vem até você. O comercial chega a ser reativo, não é? Isso tá esperando, o cara... Não é tão, mas o cara conhece você, o cara vem. Aí você não existe, você é totalmente outro extremo. É totalmente outro extremo. O cara não conhece a gente, nunca ouviu falar. É o cara da Nissan, né? A Nissan nunca ouviu falar. É o Cenogistix. Então, o trabalho da Raquel e da Alexandre é um trabalho muito mais... Tem que ser muito mais ativo, né? E aí o Elevator Feature, porque não é mais farming, né? Nesse caso é... Hunting. Hunting. E no hunting, o discurso que você mostra no comercial, ele é muito importante, né? Por isso, como é que a flexibilidade e a velocidade refletem? Mas é típico. Por isso, como é que a flexibilidade e a velocidade refletem? Mas é típico. conhece a logística, realmente uma experiência de cliente, atendimento a cliente na sua função de logística por um preço competitivo. Você realmente vai ser tratado como cliente. E você vai receber aço em vez de alumínio? Não só vai receber aço, alumínio vai receber alumínio, mas se você ligar, eu vou atender, se você mandar e-mail... É isso aqui que vai ser a chave, tipo, do futuro, da proposta de valor. É, eu não ouvi vocês que falarem confiabilidade. Não parece que estão inseridos aí na sua... Que é o caso da alumínio, que eu falei. É, porque não é atendimento, é, tudo bem eu vou ajudar a resolver um problema e tal. O problema já aconteceu. E flexibilidade é soluções diferentes. Velocidade é soluções rápidas. É que explorou um pouco isso da imagem de empresas japonesas que tem de confiabilidade. Porque o cara falou pra mim, que se essa empresa que estava no Brasil, esse cara aí, ia falar, deve ter encontrado uma empresa japonesa e ele falou pra mim é confiabilidade barra segurança barra, certeza de que eu estou, vou receber aquilo que eu estou que vocês estão comprando e, porque uma coisa o Elevator Pit, pra for force ser, depois de você estar lá o hunting, o farming aí é uma outra coisa isso e isso, propostalmente, eu não coloquei mais isso, porque é um processo, mas assim, claramente, conversando com os clientes, tanto de IFF como de SEL, a confiabilidade passa a ser um diferencial. Sim. Os caras são feitos. Talvez falamos um pouco mais dessa imagem, talvez. Então, sabe o que me chamou a atenção aqui? Comparando as coisas que vocês foram falando, de novo, ao longo das conversas, estou jogando aqui só para relembrar e ver se deveria aparecer no propósito de valor, tá? Então, por exemplo, em Contact Log você falou muito de solution design, de inovação, isso faz parte da proposta de valor deveria fazer? Porque tem que tomar um cuidado aí assim, tudo a gente pode dizer que encaixa aqui na flexibilidade e velocidade de atendimento, mas se o solution design e inovação são coisas importantes, talvez tenha preparação maior que a gente tenha que fazer para entregar isso. Só passar, é rapidinho aqui. A proposta de valor tem que ser algo que você faz a mais diferente do que o mercado faz. Porque nós temos de cara 10 concorrentes. O que os 10 fazem que a gente não faz? O que eles fazem que a gente não faz? Que é um diferencial. Solution, design, inovação, todos tem. Mas isso é condição de ser mecanômica, não é o que você é. Além disso, o que eu vou fazer? E aí, o que eu acho que é muito da ilusão entender a dor e trazer uma solução pra dor. Não necessariamente ela vai ser inovativa. Não necessariamente é só a do pessônico. Às vezes é uma mudança de processo. Então, eu acho que... Por que que o atendimento aqui é importante? Porque é você tratar bem o cliente, servir ele bem, tratar ele como se fosse o único, pra ele poder abrir pra você as dores dele, você ser capaz de desenhar uma solução. Ah, não, não, não. Que aí entra o assunto. Bom, ter flexibilidade na solução. Não quero confundir, mas no relacionamento com o cliente, no relacionamento com o cliente, eu escrevi aqui. Um ativo, comercial é ativo e operacional é ativo. Mas primeiro vamos falar do ativo comercial. A Alexandre Raquel vende em grandes empresas. DHL, Q&I, Seva. Os grandes clientes, os grandes, desculpa, os grandes concorrentes, nesses grandes concorrentes, o cliente vem até você. O comercial chega a ser reativo. Não, porque você está esperando o cara... Não, não, não, não, não é tão, mas... Mas o cara conhece você, o cara vem. Aí o sinogístico é totalmente outro extremo. É totalmente outro extremo. O cara não conhece a gente, nunca ouviu falar. É, o cara da Nissan, né? A Nissan nunca ouviu falar. A Nissan Cenogistix. Então, o trabalho da Raquel e do Alexandre é um trabalho muito mais... Tem que ser muito mais ativo, né? Uhum. Tem que ser muito mais ativo, né? E aí o Elevator Feature, porque não é mais farming, né? Nesse caso é... É hunting. Hunting. E no hunting, o discurso que você mostra no comercial é muito importante, né? Por isso, como é que a flexibilidade e a velocidade refletem? Mas é típico. Tempo de resposta da ilusão logística a qualquer solução do cliente, ele é típico. Tempo de resposta da IRC-MG para qualquer solução do cliente, ele é diferente, é rápido, vamos rápido. Vocês medem NPS com seus clientes? Ainda não. É, isso é importante. Até pra... Discutimos isso segunda-feira passada. Eu posso falar isso em dois segundos? Meu NPS é 100%... NPS, que é o play for order, é um jogo. NPS para série é outro. Série, a gente a medir diariamente. E se não atingir aqueles que pioram, não tem NPS. Agora, claro, o Xamê é uma outra história, porque ele é mais abrangente. Então, de novo, vem-se em conceitos muito diferentes para cada unidade de negócio, o jeito que cada business aqui é medido e, inclusive, a satisfação do cliente. Porque hoje eu tenho 21 clientes, eu sei exatamente o que cada um... Eu respiro os 21. Não, eu entendo. Agora, no caso do Xamir, tem 200 e lá vai a pedrada. Não tem como ele saber exatamente a satisfação diária de cada um deles. Não, mas não precisa ser diária. O ponto é o seguinte, no seu caso, vamos separar os dois casos, eu acho que tem um bom ponto. O seu caso você tem lá. Todo dia você está recebendo feedback. Mas a IPS poderia ter momentos onde você mede. Você fala assim, tá bom, agora no cômpito geral, passaram seis meses, você recomenda aí o SEM pro teu concorrente, pro outro? Sim ou não? Isso eu concordo. Só acho que satisfação de cliente, eu particularmente acho que satisfação de cliente se mede tanto na aquisição como na manutenção. Na manutenção é renovação de contrato. O cara renovou o contrato, ele está satisfeito. Ele pode até dizer que não, ou pode dizer que sim, mas se ele não renovou o contrato. E no caso do cliente? Mas pode ser o caso do cliente não renovar o contrato e estava satisfeito. Porque o banco ofereceu algo diferente que nós não oferecemos. Às vezes o valor é oposto, dependendo da situação da empresa. Pode acontecer em FFT Spot, muito Spot, isso acontece aos bons. Então aí precisa ver o que é a definição de satisfação, né? Satisfação, pra inglês ver, né? Mas satisfação é atendimento ou é custo? Não, não, não. Não, é custo. Não, é o resultado final, uma medida, você recomenda ou não. Se você não vendeu ainda o projeto, ele tem como recomendar. Você pode recomendar só o atendimento. Você recomenda, só o atendimento. Você recomenda só um minuto, você recomenda que o Alexandre como um vendedor, aí é outra coisa. Entendeu? É o máximo que ele pode recomendar. Se o processo comercial foi bem exercido, executado. Agora o NPS é para quem fez alguma coisa. E não é a mesma medida de quem continua trabalhando, não é a quantidade de vendas. Não significa que se ele não renovou é porque ele não gostava e se ele renovou é porque ele gostava. O contrário pode acontecer, ele pode renovar não gostando e pode não renovar gostando. Pode. Por uma questão de custo. Não, por questão de custo, mas porque a matriz mandou fechar com outro ou uma série de outras coisas. Estamos falando assim, a gente tem que explorar mais o decisamento em praças e as variáveis que contribuem pra decisão, pra escolha. As razões por trás. As razões por trás da escolha. Exato, porque a proposta de valor pode ser diferente. Pode ser que no momento o valor que ele tá vendo é puro custo. Aí, será que eu quero excluir? Quero arrochar mais minha carteira? Ó, eu tenho, eu toda vez que eu ganho, aí eu tenho uma... Eu nunca vi ninguém comprar nada exclusivamente por... Nunca vi ninguém. Nada. Não, não. Nada. Não, não, não. 100% exclusivamente, não. Não, não. Olha, eu vou derrubar cada exemplo que vocês usarem. Exclusivamente por... aí não é nem custo, só tem um outro... Tem que ter um mínimo de... Tem que ter alguma outra coisa sempre. A gente pode até argumentar que é o custo, mas... de head to head tem outras variáveis. E que muitas vezes a gente nem vai saber, porque o cliente pode simplesmente falar... Eu uso esse argumento com os vendedores. É, mas não tem o preço. Calma, eu uso a mesma coisa. E acho que nunca é, nunca, não sei se é muito forte, mas quase sempre, nunca é, quase sempre não é só por preço. Além de preço, ele enxergou uma possibilidade em outra empresa e ele talvez até enxergasse nossa, mas há outra possibilidade mais o preço fez com que isso e pato e tudo é a minha expressão é essa o preço conta mas ele até fala que o preço não é assim tem uma coisa muito que é subjetiva né às vezes o cara gostou do vendedor né tem isso também néostou do cara, que acha que vai ter atendimento melhor, né? Que vai ter gente melhor, né? Então tem isso também, né? Tem habilidade. E aí, falando um pouquinho de canais, né? Olha só, canais. O Alexandre e o Raquel, mesmo, o original se estiver lá. A grande maioria dos nossos contatos comerciais de hunting, de hunting, farming também, mas de hunting, vem ou de referências de clientes, referências de outras divisões da Ilustre Logística, ou é o funcionário da Ilustre Logística, o vendedor que tem o contato, ele tem uma planilha lá. O que é diferente de a gente ter mapeamento de onde a gente quer atacar e... Então vocês são muito reativo, né? Re... Muito reativo, né? É... É... A palavra... Raquel, é o Alexandre, por algo ali, corrijam-se se eu tiver errado. Eu acho que a Fórias tem algo mais, assim, de mercado. Tem estudos, principalmente para segmentos que não estão dentro do que a empresa cresceu, né? Isso acho que acontece muito para os clientes e segmentos já existentes. Mas para novosas tem sim. Tá. Falando de Yussem Brasil, se refere aos negócios que foram fechados por outros países para Yussem, nós somos reativos, sim. Tá. Mas falando dos negócios que nós vendemos aqui no Brasil, raramente o cliente liga para nós pedindo para entrar aqui. Exatamente. Então, nós somos ativos, eu acho. Se somos muito ou pouco, se temos o fazendo bem feito ou não, se a gente tem capilaridade ou não, acho que são outras discussões, mas aqueles clientes como o estado daqui quase sempre foram, até porque nós não somos conhecidos, então, é um negócio que ele comentou ali, de vir bater na nossa porta. Você é bom, Vanda. O reativo é mais comum em quem é muito conhecido. É, top of mind e tal. Não, o reativo eu falei, não é nesse sentido, mas no sentido de não ter uma estratégia. Ah, sim, sim. Isso, aí eu concordo. Na apresentação que eu fiz segunda-feira passada, eu coloquei lá que a gente não palifica muito bem os clientes. A gente vai dando tiro pra todo lado e na hora que acerta um, traz. Isso a gente tá precisando fazer mais... Talvez seja assim, é mais aleatório do que estruturado. Isso, exato. Porque a gente conversou, a gente pode conversar na sua área, obviamente, né? Talvez não seria que tenha um problema de pessoal, tem um problema muito de curso também, essas duas coisas. As empresas sempre ficam naquele dilema, ou eu vou cortar custo ou eu vou investir para crescer. Tem que fazer duas coisas, às vezes não dá. Então, às vezes não sei se no curto prazo, talvez você pudesse fazer um mapeamento do que é que interessa pra você, que tem as margens maiores, você aumenta o salário, qualifica melhor a sua equipe, talvez menor, mas deixa muito para de corteses. Durante o período a gente vai encolher um pouquinho, mas pra tentar melhorar as margens e tal, ter o crescimento melhor, né? Do que você falou, que fica fatida para todo aquele lado, né? Tem diferença de margens entre clientes e... Olha, eu te dou um exemplo. Santa Catarina, Minas Gerais, e a gente não atura o Nordeste, mas por experiência do passado, Pernambuco, são estados que você... As margens de quem trabalha por questões culturais são péssimas. Santa Catarina, Minas Gerais, Pernambuco... São Paulo é muito melhor. Você consegue... passar... mais taxas. Mais taxas. Claro, o planejamento, ele vai crescer, aliás, 20%. E aí seja obrigado a ficar dando tiro, tudo é claro pra crescer. Mas eu coloco o planejamento, não, talvez ele vai crescer menos, mas com margem maiores. Clientes japoneses, claramente mais rentáveis, você consegue passar mais. Não consegue, exatamente. Outros nem tanto. O que a Cristiane comentou, no segmento de cliente, é assim, está mudando. Posso falar de um tema? A pessoa anda em canais, se colocar aqui um pouco, que vende, revende clientes, etc, mas pensando em canal de vendas mesmo, vocês têm uma equipe própria, certo? Equipe própria, equipe própria. Então esse é um canal importante que ter gerido como tal. Aí a pergunta, os parceiros eles chegam a fazer as recomendações de vocês, ou seja, além da... Desculpa, equipe própria, mais simples. Japão e restante acaba sendo um outro canal, quer dizer, as coisas vêm no caso de FF, não aqui, zero. Mas pra ele é um ponto importante de gestão, tanto é que vocês tem o expatriado tal, ou coisa que valha. É... A... Parceiros é uma coisa, quer dizer, aí eu não sei, eles chegam a recomendar, as transportadoras, etc, isso é algo que tem que se prestar atenção? São pequenos, mas a gente tem alguns parceiros de negócios que trazem negócios para nós. São intermediários entre nós e os clientes, eles têm um relacionamento com os clientes e eles recomendam, são pequenos, nós não temos muitos, mas existem. Eles ganham um relacionamento, eles ganham um confinamento. Já pensamos, já trabalhamos no passado, um exemplo que não prosperou é de ter representantes comerciais. Na época o RH nos desestimulou com medo de questões trabalhistas. E é um negócio que eu sempre volto a pensar também, principalmente para estados que nós não temos estrutura e nem queremos ter estrut tal, para poder ampliar a nossa capilaridade. Isso é um alvo pendente para se praticar. É que a legislação de representante comercial no Brasil é um pesadelo, porque realmente traz mais o conceito, de repente dá para pensar. E o representante é uma forma de você aumentar a capitalidade, você aumentar muito o custo fixo. Porque o vendedor próprio antes de trazer negócio ele já custa lá o salário dele mais dois, mais dois. Mas só que tem, tinha uma certa ação bem, como fazer isso aí tem que tomar alguns cuidados e seguinte e aí pensando também no ff digital é um canal possível que deveria ser talvez aí não seja o ex-eu tô pensando só no eu acho que sim eu falo isso já um tempo depende da empresa não consegue fazer só no brasil porque operacionalmente eu preciso da empresa, tem que ser um projeto global. Eu acho que a gente está atrasado, mas estamos, temos um projeto já em andamento, daqui a um tempo isso vai ser possível. Eu acredito que no começo da reunião a gente falou sobre o crédito que a gente investe mais para dar um luxo, um atendimento de luxo e o mais simples. Esse mais simples, principalmente para crianças médios e pequenas, para mim o futuro vai ser o digital, porque é a tendência do mercado. O Edson comentou, a gente ainda gosta do atendimento pessoal. Uma parte do mercado sim, mas uma outra parte quer comprar um frete e ficar guardando as notícias. E isso a gente não está preparado para atender hoje. E eu acho que vai crescer muito no futuro. Tem empresas fazendo isso já? De forma incipiente, né? E na maioria das vezes ainda é uma forma de conexão com o cliente, mas por trás a maneira de trabalhar ainda é muito arcaica. O nosso, por exemplo, a gente está se preparando para o cliente clicar no nosso site e ver o preço de um frete. Mas a alimentação disso daí é completamente manual, dá o trabalho desgraçado todo mês e ela está sempre desatualizada. Não é automático. Não sei em logística, mas deve estar sendo em outros mercados, quer dizer, a parte agritec, das fintecs, startups. Não tem gente fazendo isso no lado de logística? Tem, tem poucas empresas, mas tem. E eu conheço uma mexicana que está no Brasil, estão patinando aí para crescer. Mas eu não tenho informações assim muito detalhadas de como tá a aula, de vender, como eles conseguem fazer, mas eu sei que eles estão entrando em vários mercados dessa forma. Só para deixar no radar, porque de repente não é a questão da aquisição, mas é um jeito de entrar e ganhar velocidade. Eu acho que se a gente conseguisse, aí era uma área de investimento que eu acho importante. Valeu. E outra coisa, você falou de... só vou voltar um ponto no relacionamento com o cliente, porque você falou do ativo comercial, entendi, mas você colocou um reativo operacional aqui, o que que você estava pensando? Porque eu acho que, historicamente, a gente nunca se esforçou para na operação, aqui eu tenho exemplos, muitos exemplos da nossa área de qualidade, por exemplo. Eu acho que comparado ao mercado, a gente apresenta novidades, proposta de redução de custos, melhoria de produtividade, mas a gente ainda não é... E aí, eu acho, aí volta na questão do gargalo da qualidade da mão de obra, a gente ainda não tem uma cultura de agregar valor aos negócios dos nossos clientes. Ah, você precisa de uma cotação? Qual que é o seu volume de armazenagem? Aumentando o share of wallet aí, um mais... Quer dizer, você às vezes pensa em formas de otimizar, quer dizer, melhorias contínuas, cultura do kaizen, mas não necessariamente business development dentro do cliente. Não, fazemos muito. Faz? Sim. Sim. Não, eu acho que faz isso, né? Isso tem que mudar. Eu não conhecia o seu ponto. Não, tem que esgordar, né? Mudou. Por isso que eu digo, a ASIS tem um pouco de passado. Inclusive aqui em mercado a gente já está fazendo outra coisa, no AFF. É, tem, mudou, por isso que eu digo, existe, existe um pouco de passado, inclusive aqui em mercado a gente já está fazendo outra coisa no AFF, mas quer dizer que ainda não é uma cultura, talvez em série a gente faça, mas não vejo isso em PP, não vejo isso em KK, não vejo isso em qualidade, não vejo isso em KK. Então, mas eu acho que é um bom ponto para a gente deixar pra ir pensando nessas discussões, né? É... fazer a gente faz, né? A gente tá... a diferença talvez é... a gente tá conseguindo alavancar o sucesso em tudo que a gente gostaria e usar isso como uma alavanca de negócio? Não sei. Eu acho que... eu vou falar pra você, tá? O maior sucesso nosso até então foi a SESI, né? Se eu cresço nos clientes atuais, significa que eu tô fazendo muito bem o que eu faço com um. Aí eu vou pra outra área de negócio, vou pra outra planta, que é o caso. E hoje no CL, se você não faz melhor hoje do que você fez ontem, a gente tá fora. Então não tem como a gente se acomodar e manter o processo em exício. Eu já tive até clientes novos falando, o cara é uma operação sem gente. É muito radical, mas significa que se você hoje tá fazendo o mesmo processo que você fez ontem, você vai mostrar escancarada a inocência. Não tem jeito. Então, assim, na Ayuso, acho que a qualidade talvez não traga ainda grandes mudanças, mas no dia a dia a gente já tem isso um pouco no CELE, porque o dia a dia tem que ser diferente, a eficiência tem que ser mostrada no produto saindo, entendeu? Isso reflete na renovação de contrato, né? Total. E a taxa de renovação de contratos, principalmente no CL, é muito alta. E no caso do IFF, isso eu acho que é mais latente ainda, porque o ProCL trocar o fornecedor tem um custo de saída pro nosso cliente muito alto. No IFF não tem. Exato. Então é mais fácil trocar. Então se você não fizer bem, ele troca rápido. Porque tem 50 ali tentando... Vai fazer mais ou menos a mesma coisa que você estava fazendo. Mas isso a gente tem. Por exemplo, essa medida de taxa de renovação, de churn, ou o que quer que seja, tem... A gente acompanha. Isso é exatamente o que a gente conversou essa semana, não é isso? É. A ainda não é né conceito existe mas ainda o que eu noto quem compra serviço assim é que é mais fácil aceitar adição de escopo do que aumento de preço então é outro idógio do que aumenta de preço. Então... É uma idónea, é uma tridónea. É, não, você assim, chega no, sei lá, todo ano, o que que ocorre? É curioso, né? Você tá lá, faz um contrato lá de cinco anos, mas você, ano a ano você tem a discussão de preço ou não? É, por causa de dissídio, de... Ah, aí o cliente tenta não passar o... Os clientes que apertam tentam não passar, e você tenta passar o de síntese. Ou até mais, você tenta explicar que seu índice é maior do que aqui. Na hora eu não sei quem você bota no contrato, se é IPCA ou... É, não sabe dizer nem na hora de falar do IPCA. IPCA, você tenta fazer, que bom, mas o IPCA não reflete totalmente meus custos, pode dizer. Aí entra aquele debate. E aí fica uma discussão muito difícil, assim. O cliente não quer, eu tô pensando em compras, o pessoal que tá na linha de frente, e o pessoal operacional. E aí por isso que é importante esse mapeamento dos stakeholders nesse processo. O usuário, o cara de compras que vai negociar, porque, via de regra, ninguém quer trocar. Não é bom pra ninguém. Pô, dar trabalho é caro pra caramba, primeiro tem que fazer uma puta desocuptação, pô, fazer uma RFQ de logística não é fácil, nem preparar, nem responder, né? Então, vamos dizer que o balanço dessas forças aí, você consiga passar o IPCA. Ele, porque não quer trocar, tem o uso de troca, mas por outro lado ele quer apertar você, vai, eu passo o IPCA. A única forma de crescer, cara, vai ser adicionando escopo mesmo. E aí o cliente aceita bem. Que é isso que você está falando do... Então, em outros casos. Essa, a gente já cedeu muito a isso, tá? A não aplicar. Agora é condição de se neconom aplicar. Muito desse estado aqui, com esses estrangulamentos de barro, vem a função disso. Principalmente 20, 21 e 22. Andar aqui pra frente, acabou. Não tem pandemia, não tem problema. Então, senhor cliente, essa é minha condição. Então, mas já cedemos muito e também tem cliente crescimento. A gente tem um problema de caixa hoje porque a gente cedeu a PG um prazo absurdo. Mas também é uma condição que você me acordou. Então, tem hora que você tem que decidir pra onde você vai. Mas daqui pra frente não mais. tem que decidir por quando você vai, mas daqui pra frente não mais. Mas já sim, cedemos pra ampliar escopo, pra manter o cliente, já cedemos. E nos clientes, eu coloquei a SIS, né? Porque isso tá mudando, mas em série, né, basicamente a gente veio com tecnologia e variante. Personal care. Agora, agora, é. Eu já coloquei variante. É, então, variante. Variante mais abrangente. Mas esse é um ponto pra gente discutir. E no segmento de clientes, o Alexandre também está mudando isso, né? Mas, porque a gente sempre fez empresas japonesas e empresas não japonesas. Da forma como a gente... Enxerga ela. O Alexandre está trabalhando junto com a corporação. São seis segmentos que a Ilse Logística quer focar. Ah, isso é o que eu queria. Tem isso aí. Tá. Pharma, Healthcare, Aerospace, Automotivo, Alimentos, Tecnologia e varejo. que a gente quer dizer em varígio. Variagem é o nosso caso, a de série é bem no consenso. Mas você está falando do PEDA ou do CERN, não do IAF. É, o PEDA ou do CERN. O foco principal, nem o tipo de varígio, é vender o serviço que a empresa chama de supply chain solutions, que é a visibilidade dos embarques que essas empresas têm nos contatos com as companhias maritimas. Serviços agregados. Entendi. Não é o produto varejo. Não, a maior parte dos clientes ou desse tipo de produto são varejistas. De diversos setores. É o cliente varejo, não é o produto de varejo. Exato. Você não pensa em treinar no business? Mas aqui é al alimentos, não? Não, não, não. A academia é para treinamento do business mesmo. Treinamento do business. De químicos, por exemplo. A empresa não é muito forte em químicos globalmente falando. A gente tem uns clientes aqui que são do setor de fornecimento, por exemplo, importação de aço, de... Como é que chama? Cercas, empilhadeiras, máquinas para indústrias de agrofísica. Nós temos clientes também do setor de suco, de suco não, de álcool e de açúcar, mas não das empresas produtoras de açúcar ou de álcool e de açúcar, mas não das empresas produtoras de açúcar ou de álcool e sim da indústria que fornece maquinário para essas empresas. Isso a gente já pratica. É não tanto maquinário, Chano, mas essa parte de químicos para governos, a margem deles eu posso falar com vocês. É ótimo, mas é aquele só negócio. As maiores grandes empresas são vendidas globalmente. A IUC não entra no DuPont, em todos os setores a IUC e o logístico são fracos. Isso eu imaginava um pouco, mas... Existe um competidor nosso chamado BDP, que é uma empresa americana, que é o número um desse setor no mundo todo. Então, mas aí eu fui surpreso, porque tem várias empresas que não são multinacionais nesse setor no Brasil, realmente eu não conhecia, estou conhecendo agora. Que fadão é de 3 a 4 UB por ano, viu? Essas empresas de família, empresas fechadas, eu fiquei surpreso. Estão na cadeia de abrigo. Estão na cadeia de abrigo, sim. São um agro-biscoito. Que faz vacina animal, sabe, essas aí. Eu fiquei impressionado, eu pensei que era tudo de multinacional, mas não é, tem várias empresas aqui. Elas estão sendo compradas agora, né, pelos chineses, né, muito pelos chineses e pelos holandeses, né, não é mais, né. Mas tem várias no Brasil, eu fiquei surpreso, a margem delas são muito altas. Essas são as empresas aí. Eu podia pensar assim, mas... O Tupi? É. Essa é uma área a ser explorada. E aí no fluxo de receita, só pra... Fluxo de receita, eu coloquei de forma simplória de onde vem a nossa receita, né? No IFF. Tem o desembaratório da NERD, tem o transporte colombiário, mas ainda, 90% da nossa receita vem da diferença entre o preço de compra e de venda e as taxas acessórias no aéreo, no marítimo e no rodoviário. E no contraproducir-se existem formatos e formatos de contratos, mas, basicamente, é um Cosplus sobre pessoas, tecnologia, conhecimento e custo de armazenamento e equipamentos de movimentação. Só uma curiosidade aí, desconhecimento meu, é Cosplus mas não é planilha aberta? Tipo, é planilha aberta? Em alguns casos sim. A gente tem 30% planilha aberta, 30% fixo variável, 33% variável. O cara me paga pelo volume que ele movimenta. Porém, as operações stand alone, elas me pagam, elas cobrem pelo menos todo o fixo. O variável entra muito no cedeiro de cliente, em virgem, não é? Também, então, dividido mais ou menos assim. Mas o que eu quero dizer aqui, no modelo de receita, temos em série com a IFF, o comprador, que conhece o mercado, ele sabe mais ou menos quanto a gente está... É diferente de comprar um carro, um produto, que você não tem nem ideia de quanto custa, se você compara com os concorrentes. No nosso caso, o que eu quero dizer, nesse modelo é muito difícil de você ganhar muito, porque o comprador sabe mais ou menos quanto está custando para a gente. Não sei se isso não é FF, mas o comprador sabe quanto é o FMI. Qual que é o maior contrato que você tem? PG, PG Manaus, depois PG Louveira, depois My Dear Carrier... Não, terceiro... PG Manaus, PG Louveira. Primeiro, PG Manaus, segundo, PG Louveira, terceiro, Electrolux São José dos Pinhais, e quarto, My Dear Carrier, e aí por aí vai. Tá, pergunta bem básica, tá? PG Manaus, o que vocês fazem lá? Embalde, out-balde, na planta deles. Eu coordeno o abastecimento. Amazenagem, matéria-prima, abastecimento de linha. Tá, amazenagem... Eu tiro o produto da linha, amazeno o produto acabado. Peraí, amazenagem, abastecimento, o filet da linha, né? Eu entrego a matéria-prima pra linhaimento, o filingue da linha, né? Eu entrego a matéria-prima pra linha e tiro o produto acabado da linha. Abastecimento de linha... Recebe a matéria-prima, abastece a linha. Os caras produzem lá. Depois retira o produto acabado, faz respeito ao trabalho final. Coleta de resíduos, vocês não fazem? Não, a gente nem tem essa... A gente subcontrata, mas no caso, essas operações são dentro da planta do cliente, eles que tem lá, já junto com a fábrica. Matéria-prima... Pensando no que que a gente cita isso. E aí E aí E aí E aí E aí E aí E aí E aí E aí E aí E aí E aí E aí E aí De fábrica, não. A gente acaba discutindo bastante no CD, se isso não é pra fábrica. Tá. Vocês cobram por metro quadrado? A PED de Manaus é costas pelas pessoas, custos gerais, margem. Plus. Mais tantos por cento. Aí fica limitado, né? Limita, exatamente. É. Mas a gente tem vision que é quase que... Se ele não movimenta, falta tudo muito pouco. Só com alguns meus custos fixos. Ele paga mais a movimentação. No in e no out. Então, cada cliente tem um preço diferente. E quando você tinha esse RFQ, quando você ia responder o RFQ, ele desenhou como é que ia ser a sua operação ou você que desenhou? Eu que desenho. Você que desenha. E se alguém tivesse oferecido uma operação mais mecanizada, no final ele ia ver o custo... Depende muito, porque ainda não tem esse apetite todo para esses investimentos. Então, eles fazem primeiro o outsourcing, terceirizam e depois vão ajustando o processo. Mas não é um caminho que vai de um lado para o outro. Leva até 10 anos. É muito difícil você já entrar com uma proposta de automação. Porque primeiro você tem que entrar na operação. Se você fizer uma proposta de automação e vai querer ver sua planilha aberta de novo, ou você consegue falar assim, olha, no começo do contrato, se eu conseguir dar melhorias aqui, eu consigo te repassar 30% e eu consigo... mas eu tenho que ficar com 70%? Isso é negociado, a grande maioria de gente share, já coloca um percentual que eu tenho que melhorar de um ano para o outro. Ah. Year over year productivity. O saco. 7% de Manaus. É típico de Manaus, isso? Não, mas aqui também tem. E aí tem ganha em sharing. É, PG não tem. É porque isso é de muita automotiva. Isso é, começou em automotiva. Year over year productivity. Isso não é o nosso interesse aqui, não. É o que eu estava comentando. É o que eu estava comentando. O conselho de melhoria contínua. É o que eu estava comentando. de um mundo automotivo. Isso é a minha sonha automotiva. E o nosso negócio é interessante. Eu estava comentando que nos Estados Unidos, a operação de SEL, é cash cow por anos. E agora, principalmente, a gente vai entender porque a pandemia fez tão bem. Fez bem para a USMG nos Estados Unidos. Na USMG nos Estados Unidos, o modelo do negócio é um pouco diferente do nosso. Também é contra-projeto, mas eles têm 80% da receita nos EUA, chama Transloading. O que acontece? Vêm os containers da Ásia para Target. Então vem um monte de contêineres da China, um vem com cadeira, outro vem com parasol, outro vem com carrinho, e aí o que o Senhor Jesus faz? Ele tem um armazém comprido com um monte de docas à esquerda e à direita, então os contêineres de carrinho vêm aqui, os contêineres de guarda-chuva vêm aqui, os contêineres de carrinho vêm aqui. E aqui a Tárguea tem um software integrado com a Ilsa Vigilis, que diz o seguinte, você pega três cadeiras desse contêiner, passa três e bota naquele contêiner lá. Naquele caminhão. Naquele caminhão, desculpa. Bota mais cinco cadeiras nesse aqui. Aí pega aqueles guarda-chuvas e e re, re, re, re, re, re, faz as cadeiras, redistribui. E aí, esses caminhões, essa vai pra Target Cincinnati, essa vai pra Target São Francisco, essa vai pra Target... É um transloading, transloading. E é um modelo de negócios que dá certo, e nesse caso, não é costo por as... Correto? Por algum motivo? Não, por caixa. Não, por caixa movimentada. e nesse caso não é costa para as... correto? por algum motivo... não é por caixa... não é por caixa movimentada... mas tem dois pontos aí, né Edson? lá não chega a carga pela costa a leste, então tem que haver um transbordo de oeste para leste e outro ponto é, não tem documentação, se a pessoa gerar uma nota fiscal de cada casa... é... isso nunca vai ser implementado aqui... mas olha só que interessante, né? O ponto é que é cash cow e é muito profitable. E por que que é profitable? Por dois motivos. Por três motivos. Fidelidade com o cliente, que o contrato já tem décadas. Segundo, o modelo do contrato não é cost-plus, ele tem uma margem, mas eu não sei como é que conseguiu, mas há uma margem muito... Profita boa. E terceiro, a estrutura de custos. Armazém próprio, não é alugado. E as pessoas por hora. E a mão de obra por hora. As pessoas... Assim, o modelo de contrato, a fidelização com o cliente e a estrutura de custos, pessoas e armazéns, o modelo ideal. Bom, joga terceirizado, é engraçado lá, na operação, normalmente tem 40 bandeiras, a nacionalidade de quem trabalha lá, Não tem nenhum Estados Unidos lá, é tudo... até vai ter americano também. Mais um detalhe, né? Zero automação. Tudo no matrim manual, aquele tanto de gente, você olha de cima, aparece uma multidão indo pra lá e pra cá. Com matrim. Mas o sistema funciona direitinho. Funciona. E o armazém é próprio. Então, quando a gente fala de cash cow, né, alguma coisa a gente tem que fazer diferente. Por isso que o E6 é interessante, interessante, mas o to be, né? Comprar vazio... A gente não tá nem aberto a comprar, porque todo número que vocês passaram... Eu tenho mais um comentário, e a USEN se diferencia em Carson por ser própria, porque a DHL nos Estados Unidos faz... Translator nos Estados Unidos é o big business, tudo automatizado, só que as áreas não são próprias. E aí você consegue ter margem muito atual. >>[RT]: Consegue hoje, né? Quando ela comprou há 40 anos atrás... >>[RT]: Deixa eu pensar, deixa eu voltar no processo. Acesso concorrencial. Quando você responder a RFQ, eles já pediram planilha aberta desde o começo? Depende, cada um pede, alguns pedem, outros não. A planilha aberta é que, na verdade, o cliente quer ter o mínimo de trabalho para controlar possível. O Cost Plus é uma forma de ele ter determinada transparência em seu trabalho. Não é nem uma questão de business. Pra nós, dependendo do negócio, funciona. Mas se tem muita variação de volume, a gente poderia fazer mais dinheiro com variar. É mais conservador você ter o Cash Plus, porém, se tiver variação de volume, eu podia fazer mais com menos e ganhar mais dinheiro. Você perde as oportunidades, mas você bota um caixão no seu... É um Hedge. É um Hedge. Você bota um Hedge. Exato. Só que o que... Mas limitado. O Hedge também, se eu ganhar... A PGLouvera começou 100% variável. Que se eles tivessem um bom planejamento, eu ia fazer muito dinheiro. Só que eles não conseguem prever. Eles falam que vão fazer 2 milhões de caixas, eles fazem 1.200. E aí eu tô com uma galera lá, então é um prejuízo. Mas, então eu mudei pra Cosplans, pra diminuir o meu risco. Entendi, exatamente. Mas não é o melhor modelo de negócio pra... Mesmo com o Cosplans, você tem um tempo de resposta mínimo. Eu tenho uma estrutura mínima, exato. Acabo forçando ele a ser um pouquinho mais planejado, porque ele vai pagar a estrutura inteira à toa. Isso. Então, assim, depende muito do cliente, depende muito da estrutura, do planejamento, é muito difícil pegar um cliente que planeja. Nenhum nosso tem. Uma coisa que pode estudar, tipo, para o Gui, é a questão de adquirir um exemplo próprio. Pelos números que ela passou aqui, ela está ocupando tipo, 30 milhas quadradas. Quando eu era flamengo... Ele tá colocando, tipo, 30 milhões quadrados. Agora, pra mim, isso é... Deixa eu botar no programa aqui, porque isso tem a ver com proposta de valor. Quando você fala assim, ele não quer ter dor de cabeça, isso é parte da sua proposta de valor. Quer dizer, fazer o trabalho pra ele. Ser um full service supplier de logística, isso é a parte da proposta de valor. Olha, cara, eu quero fazer logística comigo, não é com você, o negócio é produzido. Entendeu? É por isso que a gente criou o LLP também, porque você passa de fazer processos administrativos, tira o custo de labor dele, faz o processo administrativo e ele foca no produto dele, administrativo da logística. Se eu não agregar valor pro meu cliente, eu não vou ganhar nada, eu vou ganhar muito pouco. Qualquer modelo que a gente pensar, tem que ser um modelo que agrega valor pro cliente. E aí, agregar valor não é necessariamente um custo mais baixo. Quando você falou assim, interessante, em nenhum momento você manda o preço, né? Você, né, se você, o cara quer, eu não quero ter dor de cabeça, ele quer ter menos controle, talvez quando ele pede você, eu faço o fulfilling da linha dele, eu fico pensando se tem alguma coisa no processo dele que você pudesse ajudar a dar... Nesse caso não, nesse caso até a terceirização é um ganho financeiro. O cara faz próprio. O funcionário PGR ganha R2,300, o funcionário IUSA ganha R1.800, só começa aí. Então, realmente, a terceirização, a daba tem um reaio de custo. No contrato, ele exige que você apresente, que você pague os encargos, todos. Tem que fazer isso todo mês. A grande maioria. A maioria pede. Mas isso é básico. Isso é básico. Agora, depois que a gente assume, aí sim, a gente põe o nosso jeito lá, a gente melhora o nosso processo e assim, nos três primeiros anos de contrato, a gente traz muita eficiência. Ainda que a decisão dele lá atrás de terceirizar foi por culpa. A gente sabe que a gente vai entrar e vai arrasar lá no processo, vai melhorar muito o processo do cliente. Mas nem sempre a gente tem a chance de vender isso como valor real no começo. Porque eu fico pensando na utilização de inventário como um valor que você pode dar pra ele. Também. Tem muito cliente que vem pra a gente por perda de inventário, cá são exemplos. Mas infelizmente tem clientes que fecham tanto o CEL quanto o IFF e no caso do IFF ele poderia fechar direto com a companhia marítima e fecha conosco por outro valor. Eu acho, eu vou explicar depois por que, infelizmente. É prazo de pagamento, eles só estão usando a gente pra ter maior prazo. E aí, por um lado é bom que a gente ganha um negócio, mas por outro lado é ruim, porque nós estamos financiando o capital em gero. >>[JB]: Talvez eu fico pensando aqui em modelos de... Porque uma coisa é o orgânico, outra coisa é o inorgânico, tem um no meio que é o orgânico diversificado, entre o orgânico e inorgânico, são novos negócios. Fico pensando talvez se faz algum sentido, só pra guardar um cantinho, e o sem consulting, no this consulting, pra você, cara, você tá lá dentro já, você conhece o inventário dele, você sabe o que tá acontecendo. Às vezes tem uma oportunidade de utilização de inventário. Você deu um dente pro... Mas isso é o nosso corpo. Isso já é o nosso corpo. Porque a logística, pra garantir disso, qualquer transportadora faz. Bota a caixa pra dentro, bota a caixa pra fora, registra lá e acabou. Mas o UAU ou mais a gente já faz. Essa consultoria que sai... Mas é o ponto assim, a gente não cobra, cobra dentro do contrato. Mas não faz parte do SESC. Pra sério, agora existe essa possibilidade de transformar esse serviço dentro do RFE. Eu tô me referindo assim, eu tô assim, olha, não sei se você faz, me fala se você faz isso. Carol, eu tô aqui armazenando pra você 10 mil caixas de produto tal. Mas eu estou vendo aqui o giro dela está muito pequeno, eu consigo... você poderia ter feito a mesma coisa com 5 mil caixas, mas teria ganhado tanto... Será que se você separar o negócio, será que o cliente tem a percepção que ele está pagando por esse serviço? Você faz exatamente, a gente sabe o que você faz, mas será que o cliente tem a percepção que ele está pagando por esse serviço? Você faz exatamente, a gente sabe que você faz. Será que o cliente tem a percepção que ele está pagando por esse serviço? Então eu joguei fora tanto de obsolescência, tanto de... Tem, né? O famoso fator de... Então você se separa as duas divisões e você cobra duas coisas. Pelo trabalho que o mundo faz, porque esse trabalho é considerado específico para cada empresa, né? Mas isso já se transformou em uma condição comercial, gente. Talvez não nessa dimensão pra fazer dinheiro, porque o cliente nos cobra em contrato ganho de produtividade ano contra ano. Não, sim, mas acho que... Mas isso não é um custo... Não, peraí. Não sei se isso é um custo seu, né? É geral. É da operação como um todo. Então pode ser... É índia Indy também jogou fora o produto? Tudo, pode ser, controle dele... Ela tá prestando o serviço, mas eu não sei se é por cliente ter prejuízo, sabe que ele tá pagando o serviço específico. Não, mas peraí. Gente, eles tem plena... Não é o controle do Indy. Não, peraí. Os rédeis de splatting dos clientes são pessoas extremamente... Sushicadas. Completas e sushicadas, eu já falava isso. atingindo os clientes a pessoas extremamente incompletas. Eu já falava isso. Sabem todos os processos que podem existir. Todo mundo buscando, do lado deles também, acabar com desperdício e ineficiência. Por exemplo, você vendeu um contrato com um cliente. Se você perguntar para ele, você sabe que está pagando qual é o serviço consultório e qual é o meu serviço de consultoria, qual é o meu serviço... Não, mas isso não existe. Mas isso remete ao... É mais talvez assim. A consultoria no CL é implícita, tanto pro pré-venda, como pra implementação, como pro pós. Eu sou especialista em logística. O que o cliente compra? Ele compra a caixa entrando e saindo? Não. Ele compra a melhoria que eu vou passar pra ele no dia a dia. Eu tenho que dizer pra ele o que ele tem que fazer. E não ele vir pra mim e dizer, olha, eu tô com agent, você conserta aí pra mim? Aí ele não precisa de mim. Então, o operador logístico tem um papel consultivo sempre. E já é o produto. Eu não vejo isso diferenciado e cobrado de uma certa forma, a não ser que a enxergue. Aí sim. Mas eu acho que também, humildemente, eu acho que existem níveis e níveis desse serviço, por exemplo. Lembra que o plano do negócio da Alexandre incluía a consultoria fiscal, sabe? Agora com a reforma do governo, muda tudo. Mas oportunidades aparecem. Ou pode ser que apareçam, mas... Ninguém sabe o que vai acontecer direito. Mas o Alexandre falou o seguinte, no processo do IFF, que é o frete, a gente vai aprender com o cliente, vai conhecer mais o cliente e talvez a gente consiga desenvolver um produto de consultoria fiscal. Que é o exemplo lá do automotivo, etc. Porque a consultoria, é que nem a Santa, né? É que nem a Santa. A Santa,. A Santa é um exemplo emblemático também. Eu tenho certeza que existe uma consultoria de um certo nível que a gente fornece para o cliente e ele não sabe que ele está pagando isso, ele não sabe a percepção de valor. Ele só, sabe, isso aí é básico do LSP, ele tem que fazer isso aí. E ele fecha o contrato de terceirização, de operação, sabendo que ele vai receber um pouquinho desse desconhecimento. Ele quer receber. Por outro lado, eu também acho que existe um outro nível de consultoria mais estratégico. A Santa Rosinha, por exemplo, ele quer saber, ó, quando que você vai reduzir o frete rodoviário, né? Lembra? Que é a coisa que a Mieba poderia... A Mieba... Você queria dizer o seguinte... O Construído, será que você poderia ter uma pessoa pra vender na reunião de Assenovir deles? Eles não abrem. Não, claro que não. Não, eu sei, eu tô indo no limite. Eu tô indo no limite de consultoria. Eu só tô tentando... Desculpa. Minha posição aqui, minha atitude é assim, eu não quero aumentar mais. Como é que... Talvez para ser um produto... Uma fonte de... Eu concordo que uma parte dessa consultoria já está imbutida, mas se a gente subir o nível dessa consultoria... Então, esse é o problema, só que está imbutido, né? Eu tive várias experiências, 20 consultorias. Só que aí a gente, a pessoa em geral, a mental, a prejuíza, mas às vezes você está fazendo mais coisa do que você estava combinado antes, mas não está em contrato. Ainda tem que fazer, né? Não sei se... tem alguma coisa no mercado que faz, eu entendo. Mas já que você está fazendo coisa a mais, que é o seu ponto, talvez. Essa que é o exemplo, a gente, a fornecer relator de hedge, calcula direitinho, faz sugestão, você tem que vender esse produto, tem que vender... É, aqui é alto, bem abaixo, tudo está na hora. Mas será que não poderia, talvez, eventualmente, você pegar isso por cento? É, umas coisas, não sei se isso já está no inquisito ou pelo menos... Acho que a gente tem que discutir o que a gente não está fazendo, né? Isso mesmo. Não pode dar pra nada, mas deixa exposto no contrato que você está oferendo de serviço. Isso é uma coisa pra gente discutir, porque o modelo da USMG, Estados Unidos, com a Target, pode ser uma referência. O modelo de faturamento é diferente, é ativo próprio e a estrutura de custos é bem enxuta por causa da mão de obra terceirizada. Será que não é uma referência para a gente repensar aqui no Brasil o armazém próprio? Durante 10 anos talvez vai custar mais, mas depois do 11º, vai lá pra baixo, né? Vai lá pra baixo. É o quê? Se tivesse feito aquela quinhentos dólares... Já teria, já teria, já teria depreciado. Seguro, se desfazem por... É, eu faço muito dinheiro com o seguro. Inclusive, é um ponto de atenção que a gente vem discutindo. Quando eu for aprovar os propósitos comerciais, eu peço para separar o PNL com o seguro e sem seguro. Porque é uma baita alavanca de receio. Mas a gente tem que tomar cuidado com isso, porque se no dia seguinte o cliente decide que ele vai entrar numa apóstole dele global, vai sair da nossa, não posso contar com eles, mas ele entra como um plano, não é o deles o problema. Não faz baita, faz pouco, mas fazemos dinheiro seguro, porque é uma grande maioria dos pacientes já tem a sua própria pólice. Tá, e para onde eles transportem? Entendi. E para a armazenagem também. Para a armazenagem dentro da pólice geral. É, por exemplo, agora a Invision foi para Cajamar, a segura deles inclusive é o que tá impactando a transferência. Eles me dão uma carta de direito de regresso, eu só tenho o meu seguro de responsabilidade civil, então eu não faço dinheiro com a Envision. Mas os demais todos, né, agora, faço dinheiro com a Envision. Tá. E vocês têm uma seguradora parceira? Tóquio. Tóquio Marinho. Tá. Podia entrar aqui com os parceiros, né? Não sou tão... A Tóquio, inclusive, faz toda a nossa gestão de risco. E mesmo lá em Cajamarca, onde a gente não tem o seguro, a gente fez igualzinho. A Tóquio foi vendida agora. Quer dizer, agora tem um ano e pouco. Mas eles são bons, são bons parceiros. Tóquio Maria. Mas ele tá bom, são bons parceiros. Toc Maria aí. E diga quem. Não. Fodeu. Toc Maria? Comprou o Sebrador aí. Comprou. É a Sombra que foi vendida, desculpa. A Sombra? A Sombra. A Sombra que foi vendida. A Sombra. Toc Maria e Sombra. Você tá falando que vai ver esse bicho aqui? E a Sombra, né? E a Sombra que foi vendida. E a Sombra. E a Sombra. E a Sombra. E a Sombra. E a Sombra. E a Sombra. E a Sombra. Chó. Tóquio Marina e Chó. Você trabalha para a insubicio? É? Tóquio Marina e Chó. Tóquio Marina e Chó. Tá, seguro nosso. Você já tem um arranjo para Tóquio Marina? Vão te dar bons preços. Sim, vão dar bons preços. E o ressarcimento é? É, o ressarcimento é? É, isso vai acabar com a minha vida. Ah, é assim. A não ser casos, mas no cyber-ataque, bom. Bom, bom. Não, eu estou morto com meus parceiros. Assim, são caros, né? Comparado a outros. Isso me remete, assim, um próximo exercício, só um por exemplo. Um próximo exercício, eu acho que a gente, se for fazer a EFFCL, a gente quebrar o profetêanlo, sabe? Porque aí a gente vai descobrir, ah, quanto você gasta de advogado? É, pode ser bom, né? Aruguel, pra gente... A EFF, quanto é a receita de frete? Quanto é a receita de desembaraço? Quanto é a receita de frete, quanto é a receita de desembaraço, quanto é a receita de seguro. A gente tem essa matriz pra gente saber, na qualquer situação disso. E se a gente quer crescer a receita, aonde a gente gostaria de crescer? Eu não sei o que o... Mas eu acho que essa separação seria seria mais um teto em uma estrutura. Uma coisa é a estratégia do business, né? Outra coisa é a estrutura para atingir essa estratégia. Você falou de abrir, né? Você não vai junto, né? Por exemplo, não sei. Se você vai fazer 5%, a Doni vai tirar, né? Então onde vai vir 5%? Mais uma pergunta aí. O EZs aqui do modelo de negócio está já consolidado, valia a pena... Eu não sei, quanto que vocês discutiram isso antes? Talvez aí um próximo... Tentando quebrar em passos, né? Ainda valia a pena pegar o IFE, FCL, separar isso aqui, que tem, tá um pouco aqui, mas separar todo ele. A gente acabou discutindo ainda pouco o As-Is, né? Fizemos um bocado de coisa aqui que pro nosso entendimento também do negócio, fato. Mas tem um próximo passo aí do As-Is pra cada um dos dois, né? Já partindo da premissa que é o As-Is, o futuro, né, o to be, como que a gente alavanca. Para alavancar, precisa acrescentar esse elemento aqui na minha proposta de valor, eu preciso vou alavancar ali na receita a corretagem de seguros, não sei a palavra que vocês usaram, mas só para usar mesmo. Acho que também essa quebra aqui ajudaria a gente a identificar melhor ainda, né? Antes de partir para a projeção de número, né? Mas assim, quais são esses elementos que poderiam... Ah, eu acho que está bem vinda com o plano, né? Que a gente tem agora, talvez seja detalhar um pouco. É, eu acho que também a gente não precisa reinventar a roda. Já existe um plano de negócios, já existe um plano de negócios AFF, já tem algum número desses planos. Eu acho que agora é... que esses planos reflitam em números e a gente... só que que esses números sejam quebrados, pra gente saber de onde que vai vir. O que ele faz? Porque ele vai ter que ver, tipo, ele vai querer, tipo, aumentar a receita, vai querer aumentar o OP2, são duas coisas diferentes. É, porque eu acho que o plano de negócios, ele prevê um número que talvez seja diferente do que a gente quer atingir. Então, se o foco for aumentar o P2, vai ter que diminuir a área de mais concentrado, naquilo que tem margem maior, por exemplo. Para ter algo mais sustentável no médio prazo, por exemplo. Porque você crescer receita é uma coisa, mas se você crescer receita, o custo mais rápido não ajuda nada. Ou só o preço vai se diminuir por um tempo. Então, mas é importante a gente conhecer os nossos break eventuais. Então, é por isso que é importante mostrar. Por algo que a gente não sabe. importante ele mostrar. O que o Dr. André docia. Qual que é a pergunta? O business plan que foi montado ele está nesse nível de detalhe que cabe? Então se pedir para o Jôni ele consegue colocar aqui e comparar com o teste, né? Tem por produto, a gente colocou lá no caso, expansão diária, real care, o que vai crescer, quanto, até 25. Mas em termos de números, esse é o número. Ah, esse não é diferente do 10? Não, eu não fiz, aquele plano de negócio eu fiz só apresentando onde a gente ia e mostrei o 10 no final não mudei não fiz outro mas quer dizer, esse plano de negócio reflete esse... isso é, é isso aqui isso que tá quebrado no caso aí chegou em número, pra cada um desses itens ah tá não, mas esse número esse plano reflete em números e os números tão iguais aos 10 é isso aí precisa dar uma olhada eu não me lembro o quanto eu peguei o mesmo... eu peguei o 10 e botei como no último slide igual aos outros, né? É isso aí, precisa dar uma olhada. Eu não me lembro o margem. Eu peguei o mesmo, eu peguei o 10 e botei como no último slide dessa apresentação. É isso aí, na verdade não foi o contrário. Nem entrei no mérito. O que fazer para chegar no 10? Isso. Aí a gente pôs, eu não lembro, precisa dar uma resgatada aí. Mas se a gente seguir o plano de negócios que está nos slides, a receita e a margem é esse do 10? Pelo menos, eu acho que pode ter alguma coisinha a mais, mas é pelo menos isso aí. Mas será que nesse caso a gente não deveria revisar, revalidar o plano de negócios e aí como conclusão ver onde a gente vai chegar e ver se onde a gente vai chegar é o que é o menor. Eu acho que o nosso compromisso com a corporação é o 10, mas aí cabe definir para onde nós aqui local vamos. Mas o ponto é o 10 já não está mais valido. Não está totalmente desatualizado. Agora é estranho porque o plano de negócios está atualizado, mas o DES não está. Então, estranho não. Para mim não bate. É, precisa ver toda a gente. Agora que são tantos números, eu não me lembro. Preciso dar uma revisitada. Porque a GFF eu estou certa. A UDES não planeja nenhum outro número. No longo prazo, assim porque se você fizer o plano vai trazer mais que 10 o plano não é assim tão científico quanto de retorno vai vir em cada uma dessas iniciativas pode ser que se cumprir tão bem o plano passe do 10 ou seja aquém do 10 então a gente talvez tenha que agora fazer, ligar isso a sensação que dá olhando o 10 é que, tá, usando a palavra sem julgar aqui. Mas daí eu penso assim, as coisas que vocês vão discutindo, que tem oportunidade de fazer melhorar, daria mais que eu pudesse. Isso tem uma razão, Prince. O décimo foi feito em 2019. E a Fiat, por exemplo, em 2018, teve um prejuízo de 2 milhões e 600 mil reais. Até a base de... pra olhar pra frente era outra. Hoje, passado 4, 5 anos, a situação é bem diferente, bem melhor. E aí não foi feita uma nova atualização. A gente esquece, né? Eu tava numa crise, lembra? 19 também. Dilma. Não, não quero atender a gente. Eu só tenho uma pergunta, assim, puxando um pouco o que o Saulo falou lá atrás, assim, se a gente, se a meta é os 200, os 180, ou o que quer que seja, milhões, de repente a gente vai fazer só as coisas incrementais, será que tem ideias e coisas que vocês estão discutindo, dificuldades que não dava para puxar mais isso? Quer dizer, a preocupação é só o seguinte, se sair de baixo para cima, de repente vai chegar no, como é que você falou lá, o incremental, o orgânico, o que quer que seja. E como que a gente faz para se desafiar? E uma pergunta antes, claro, queremos nos desafiar? Pode ser que não, não é assim, pode ser, olha, não, mas de tudo que vocês estão falando dá a impressão assim que a gente ainda é, o clube tem um market share relativamente pequeno, tem coisas, áreas novas que a gente fala que a gente poderia entrar, tem uma dificuldade dia a dia, verdade, operacional, mas quer colocar um uma barra mais mais alta tem dificuldade para chegar na barra sim sempre terá mas vamos vamos colocar isso e ver daí você vê de trás para frente né a tá falar um número qualquer aqui tá a 400 milhões da para 400 que a gente teria que pensar diferente? Porque se for no incremental, a gente não vai pensar tanto no diferente, né? E aí talvez chegue naquelas questões que você tava levantando antes. Eu vou na forma de... Tem uma canetinha aqui? Vou dar um chute aqui, tá? Ah, obrigado. Talvez uma forma de pensar aqui... A gente pega aqui o... Usando uma forma de pensar aqui. A gente tem aqui, usando uma forma de pensar. A gente está falando do orgânico, crescimento orgânico, mais mesmo, orgânico diversificado, e o M&A. E o M&A. Isso aqui é fazer mais daquilo que eu já tenho, que eu já faço, dos dois negócios, mais dos meus modelos de negócio, que é basicamente você tem que incrementar, ter ganhos incrementais e ter mais estrutura, mais gente pra fazer a mesma coisa. Aqui é algo que eu tenho que adicionar alguns, ter um conhecimento dobro diferente, coisas mais tangenciais ao meu negócio atuar, mas que eu não preciso fazer aquisição, não preciso entrar num contrato de compra e venda. Posso trazer uma pessoa diferente, aumentar o meu processo comercial como consultor, ganhar mais dinheiro com o seguro, sei lá o quê. Mas parecido mais que eu preciso adicionar recursos, mas que eu faço com meus ativos, meus próprios ativos. Aquilo que eu preciso de ativos de terceiros, isso é uma forma de pensar. Tem uma outra forma de pensar que eu acho que é bem legal para Business Development de Mose, algumas vezes, é assim. O que é o meu universo? Eu tenho aqui, sei lá, geografia, quais são as dimensões da venda, né? Eu tenho geografia, eu tenho tipo de serviço, vão ter que me ajudar. Eu tenho aqui uma... o que que define a minha venda, assim? O local pra onde eu vejo, eu acho que eu posso ter uma nacionalidade dos clientes, os locais onde eu opero, eu posso ter os tipos de logística, quais são as outras dimensões? Eu posso ter, sei lá, o nível de automatização do serviço, automatização, sofisticação do trabalho que eu faço dentro de logística, né? Eu posso ter... Indústria, setor, entraria aí? Hã? Indústria, setor, observar? Pô, eu posso... isso, indústria, perfeito. Indústria... pode ser que tenha alguma outra aqui. E aí você diz aonde que você está, tá? E a onde você gostaria de estar para cada um desses. Pensa lá, eu quero crescer em... puta, eu tô nessas indústrias, eu quero estar em novas indústrias, mas em outras nacionalidades. Ah, beleza. Aí você tá desenhando mais ou menos os seus caminhos de crescimento. Porque o que a teoria e a tática mostra é que é muito difícil você fazer crescer em todas as dimensões ao mesmo tempo. Por exemplo, uma pessoa que opera em logística, imagina que você pudesse dizer, quero colocar uma união sem logística, igual eu estou em Ghana. Você precisa de tanto investimento pra isso que talvez não faça... não valha a pena, mas, ah, eu quero ampliar nas indústrias que eu sirvo. Então, beleza, eu posso fazer o mesmo serviço, a mesma parte do logístico, o mesmo PR, pra outras indústrias. Ou eu posso ter armazéns em novas geografias, para o mesmo serviço. Entende o que eu estou falando? É uma forma de definir o Azize, para onde eu quero ir, com nível mínimo de investimento. Agora, eu, como não sou expert nisso, não fui muito feliz em definir. Talvez indústria e tipos de produtos que eu transporto, essa talvez seja outra dimensão. Então, quer dizer, não é só indústria, mas o tipo de transporto, tipo de produto, talvez essa seja outra dimensão. Tipos de produtos. Eu acho que a ideia da discussão, tanto no gráfico da esquerda que é mais simples, quanto na direita, a ideia é a mesma, né? Para onde que nós... Isso! Isso! É só forma diferente de mostrar. Agora, o que é bacana é assim, não é só tipo de cliente, né? É região, é serviço,, abrir a cabeça, para que direção nós vamos para aumentar a receita e melhorar a margem. Acho, também, adicionando, que para melhorar a margem a gente tem que olhar a parte de custos também, sabe? Sim. Não é só trazer o cliente, a gente tem que... Eu acho que a gente tem uma baita oportunidade... Sim, sim. Aqui, eu quero ter um contrato de qual nível de autor, eu quero mandar mais labor intenso, ou menos... Você pode ter um eventual, você pode ter o que é um costo, modelo de contrato. Isso, será. Modelo de contrato, eventualmente é possável. Organização. Organização. É porque, por exemplo, o André mencionou que o Ipernambuco é um problema. Desculpa o modo estruturado do Ipernambuco. O Ipernambuco é ruim, por exemplo, mas por exemplo, mostramos porque a gente define a área dele, o problema é que tem margem maior, a gente tem que concentrar nessa área, com uma equipe melhor, mais qualificada. Por que o Ipernambuco tem várias empresas, japonesa e só, por exemplo, hoje. Você entra, mesmo em Pernambuco, na região, que pode ser interessante, você entra nessas empresas japonesas que estão lá. De qualquer forma, eu acho que tudo isso tem que ser feito com números, sabe? Eu não acho que funciona muito plano subjetivo, depois se tudo der certo, talvez, tem que olhar... Ali tenta definir as dimensões do business model, modelos de negócio mesmo. Por exemplo, se eu falar assim, Raquel, agora eu quero que a partir de amanhã você venda só contratos com 95% de automatização. Não é diferente? A forma de vender, o trabalho que você vai ter, é quase como se fosse um outro modelo de negócio. É diferente de falar assim, Raguel, você sai de fama e vai para agribusiness. É outro desafio. É isso que a Alie tenta representar. Não, é só você vai se concentrar em contratos com tal margem, por exemplo. Aí é outra coisa, por exemplo. Mas ali não é essa, não é o contrato com tal margem. Isso é um indicador. Ali são mais as variáveis do negócio. Não, não, por exemplo, eu vou supor que tem esses dados que vai ter que ser 5% por exemplo, a margem aqui. Então, para isso, ele vai ter que concentrar algumas contras com tal, né? Ele vai ter que concentrar algumas regiões, né? Algumas daqueles itens, não em todas, né? Depois você muda para ter em todas, né? Você, vocês em algum lugar, algum cliente fazem pick-pack mesmo? É o pessoal? Um trato de recebo? Não, tem nós de individual, mas fazemos como parte do processo. Mas pra ele tá... Pack por quê? Pra uma outra unidade da mesma empresa? Não. Você percebe normazengo? Não. A gente... É que nem faz, mas tanto faz. Electrodux. Pick-pack. Electrodux sim, o PG lá em Manaus na saída sim. Cassio. Cassio, gente, então... Mas na saída do produto acabado. Não é o Ampic, né, o Ripec, o Divi... Ampic é a pergunta. Não, não, porque isso talvez seja tipos de serviços que eu... Realizo. Mas imagina que você tá pensando em Natura, L'Oreal... Isso. E tem isso como um produto separado. >>[A]: É isso aí! >>[AF]: O hormônio faz parte do processo todo, não é uma coisa separada. >>[A]: É isso mesmo que eu tava pensando. >>[JS]: Como direção, né? Como direção, eu acho que a gente tem que pegar os planos de negócio que estão bem claros e muito bem feitos e a gente refletir o plano de negócios. É um baita de um desafio, mas tentar refletir em números. Não deixando de falar, tem um plano de negócio e vai no 10. Não acho que é tão, né? Mudou as variáveis, mudaram todas. Então, tem que ter um trabalho. E aí quem vai fazer, não é que a gente precisa discutir, mas aí a gente, baseado no plano de negócios, onde a gente vai chegar, né? Qual vai chegar? E aí ver se onde vai chegar é uma aspiração, assim, acho que esse é o objetivo, né? O objetivo é assim, eu parto do princípio que a gente não tá aqui pra ficar fazendo budget, tem que ficar obedecendo a organização, se é pra fazer isso não precisa de nós três, acho que nós três estamos aqui pra aspirar e levar essa organização pro mar, nós lideramos, a gente não fica obedecendo, e eu acho que isso reflete no plano de negócio, agora o plano de negócio tem que ver no número. E se o número é um número que a gente fica feliz, que é ótimo, se não, a gente vai ter que abaixar o top. Esse top pra vocês, né, então, acho que mais ou menos a gente concordou em colocar metas mais ou menos agressivas, né? E assim, o que eu acho que o Sá e o Fábio falaram, eu acho que, o Carlos sempre falava, e vai ter que, assim, numa empresa vai ter que, assim, como são recursos escassos, vai ter que concentrar algumas áreas, não tem jeito, algumas áreas são os dois contratos, não tem jeito, não vai dar para ficar fazendo assim, sem estratégia para atingir isso. Então, é uma coisa que é meio dura para as pessoas, mas acho que algumas coisas, vai ter que cortar algumas coisas que interessam, na verdade. Aparentemente não vai crescer a receita, mas provavelmente a margem vai crescer ainda. Então, mas o que eu entendi, me conheço errado, quer dizer, a proposta é partir dos planos de negócio daquele plano 2025, que foi elaborado, só que começar a traduzir em números e a gente continuar a discussão aqui tentando ver o que dá para tirar mais e do lado de vocês ficar claro também os recursos que vocês precisam para fazer aquilo lá que talvez esteja mais elaborado aqui, talvez aí tem que descolar do... do... desce, esqueci a sigla, mas fazer a discussão ali. Eu acho que o plano 2025 foi um deva da corporação. Você está entendendo que aqui a gente quer fazer algo diferente, ou paralelo, ou adicionado. Então, por isso que está tudo interpelado a déficit e tudo mais. Pode ser um guia, tem que ser um guia, porque afinal de contas, não dá pra mudar o curso assim, né, de uma forma radical. Mas talvez adicionar itens para o médium ou longo prazo. E aí vai sair totalmente do déficit. Aí tem uma questão, né, Alexandre tem um bom ponto, assim. O que nós vamos acordar aqui, e o que nós vamos acordar aqui e o que nós vamos mostrar com a corporação. Isso aqui faz o mínimo pra gente. Na corporação faz o mínimo pros caras pararem de encher o saco, né, embora a gente vai mostrar o que a gente quer fazer. Agora, o que vai mostrar uma coisa, mas, veja assim, mais uma vez, eu não acho que a gente está aqui para ficar obedecendo... Não, sim, eu só queria dizer que a gente pode tomar como ponto de partida e adicionar coisas para a frente. E uma partida disso, a gente vai mostrar uma parte. Eu estou falando isso, mas eu não perguntei para ele. O que você acha da ideia de... se foi necessário o investidor se concentrar em contratos maiores? Como você acha? Quais são os pontos positivos e negativos? O ponto negativo principal é que para eu me tornar mais competitivo eu preciso ter mais negócios para facilitar o meu processo de compra de frentes. Isso é um bom ponto. Se eu shrink demais, se eu perder pescado, passa a ser mais difícil de conquistar negócio. Então tem o que tem hoje, a partir de dia em diante... Escolher onde crescer. Isso, isso é. E isso é o que a hoje, a partir de dia em diante, escolher onde crescer. Isso, isso. Isso é o que tem hoje, isso é o que tem hoje. Eu estou bem... Não diminui muito. Ah, ok. Então, mas isso me conheço se eu estiver errado aqui. Aí aplica-se em geral a isso em Brasil. Porque vocês estão num patamar que vocês estão falando, eu preciso crescer, preciso ganhar alguma escala. Qualquer maneira, vale no que você falou, vale também ali. Então, de certa maneira, eu acho que a gente está concordando que precisa ter um patamar mais elevado. Podemos saber se é 175, 200 ou 400, mas a gente está concordando que tem que ter uma etapa de crescimento. E eu acho que a gente tá num ponto que... precisava tirar o chapéu aqui do dia a dia, que atrapalha, né? Mas, assim, o que dá pra desafiar? Quer dizer, onde que acha que... Ou seja, meio sem restrição, né? Onde que a gente acha que dá pra chegar? A gente, por parte de vocês, muito, né? Vocês conhecem o negócio, pra ver qual que poderia ser esse outro patamar, daí a gente volta e vamos desdobrando de novo o que precisa pra ter isso, mas a gente não tem ainda esse consenso e refletido em número de qual que é esse patamar novo que poderia atingir, Talvez, estou pensando... Nesse sentido, eu acho que em janeiro nós podíamos fazer duas reuniões. Não sei se em janeiro e fevereiro ou duas em janeiro, mas eu faria... Bom, na verdade eu gostaria de fazer uma de BP, porque eu acho que é um gargado, não é um agregado. Mas, é só outra discussão. Talvez uma reunião focada em CL e uma reunião focada em FF, porque eu acho que são coisas diferentes. Mas, talvez, a gente tentar discutir como é que a gente reflete o plano de negócios que já está pronto qualitativamente, quantitativamente, aí depois a gente vai somar, depois a gente vai somar e aí ver o que que sai. Nada como ter números, né? E a gente olhar para o número e dizer, é isso? Já está super desafiador. O objetivo, acho que é esse, a gente olhar os dados, os fatos, e para onde a gente acha que está indo. Chega em 2027, não sabia que ia chegar aqui. É só olhar, mais ou menos. É, eu acho que essa discussão de entender um pouco... Aquele primeiro plano que é o orgânico mais do mesmo, que é muito mais relacionado com esse plano aqui. Aquele plano é praticamente o primeiro plano. A gente precisa entender para cada... Alguns indicadores de participação de mercado e market, assim, market share mesmo, share of wallet dentro dos clientes. Você entendeu o TAN, o SON e o SOM? Eu falo de marketing, né? Total available market, total addressable, total... como é que é? O SOM é o service, o mercado que eu consigo, operacionalizar minhas dadas, minhas restrições. E pra ver assim, vou dar um exemplo pra vocês. Quando eu, dependendo de onde você esteja, se for dos 20 e 80, né, eu tenho outro exemplo. Uma vez o pessoal da Oxigeno me procurou pra falou assim, ah, vamos crescer. Eu falei, Oxigeno já era 100% de óxido de eteno. Eu tenho jeito de crescer. Se eu paro, ele fala, não, mas são 100% de óxido de eteno. Mas se eu fizer produtos, indústria em geral, petroquímicos, químicos, petroquímicos, aí você começa a ter agora eu já sou 0,1%, agora eu tenho 99,9% de campo para poder crescer, quer dizer, a minha área de arena competitiva é maior, entende? É um pouco essa... A nível de discussão, é típico, a diferença entre a consultoria e a realidade do dia a dia. Eu tentaria focar, focar... Não pode sair com 17... Ah, não, tudo bem. Não, não, não, não, entendi. Mas eu, o que eu quero dar um exemplo assim, não, não, é outra coisa que eu vou fazer, assim, eu já tenho, eu já sou 100% em farma, então não posso focar em farma. Eu tenho que adicionar um... entendeu? Não, você não pode focar em farma, mas não dá pra propor 17... Não... Não, eu acho que a gente tem que sair com 5 ações realistas aí, como a gente fez lá no Rio. Não, o senhor não propõe 17, não. Não? Não, não sei. Não, pelo amor de Deus. Tem que ser executivo. Isso, tem que ser executivo. É. Pode ser executivo, isso, tem que ser executivo. Vamos revisar nossa mão de obra, nosso processo de RH, vamos atacar o mercado de medical devices, vamos revisar nossa matriz, nosso pipeline de AFF, não sei, né, mais coisas. Vamos comprar um armazém, né, tem que ter algumas coisas. Só pegando isso aí pra pensar nessas duas próximas reuniões, eu ainda insistiria um pouco no seguinte, que eles trabalham, vocês fizeram hoje, do modelo de negócio, quebrar pra cá, ver se tá tudo ok, tá todo mundo conversando a mesma coisa, ponto um. Ponto dois, vocês tem aquele, naquela slide lá do plano 2025, tem ali um pouco essas grandes iniciativas, mas elas não tão caracterizadas como tal, talvez possa só ser, quais vão ser essas grandes iniciativas, mas elas não estão caracterizadas como tal, talvez possa ser só ser, quais vão ser essas grandes iniciativas e daí ponto 3, essa primeira projeção dos números, que daí isso podia ser concretamente essa discussão próxima e vai ter um tempo pra vocês refletirem e tentar nos usar como,board, assim, pra ajudar que é um negócio, meter pitaco e ver se dá pra criticar alguma coisa mas talvez essas três coisas, que é macro, iniciativas e números e daí voltar, daí só tem que marcar e ver o que vocês precisariam também, o que dá pra ajudar nesse meio tempo também, o que dá para ajudar nesse meio tempo. É, eu acho que a próxima missão de casa é minha, junto com a Raquel e com a Alexandre, para a gente validar e conversar um pouquinho, eu fiz em cima da hora, então mandei muito em cima da hora. Aí é isso, conversar sobre os planos que nós possamos ter, como é que a gente consegue refletir o plano de negócio nessa planilhaha aqui. Eu acho que essa planilha tá boa porque tem todos os números aqui que ajuda a gente a olhar uma coisa e outra. E ver se a gente consegue e ter isso pronto para a próxima, para a gente... Tá. É impossível, pô, dá para trazer os custos abertos. Não sei se é por conta da tecoraria, assim, pensando o que que tá falando de aluguel, aluguel de obra, advogado, essas coisas. Para um primeiro nível. Primeiro nível. Jumping to this conclusion, eu sei que nós estamos falando sobre gargalos hoje aqui, mas um gargalo claro para a gente é a qualidade da nossa mão de obra. Mesmo que o PRO-ORH tenha um direcionamento para onde a gente tem que revisar e como é que a gente tem que participar, né, a partir das nossas novas contratações. Não queria objetivar mais isso, se for possível. Então, é isso, eu vou de alguma forma. Eu queria entender isso melhor, o que é qualidade, de onde que isso vira gargalo, onde que isso está prejudicado, onde que isso vira gargalo, onde que isso está prejudicado, e que é no dia a dia, na operação lá no dia a dia, como é o back office aqui, aí é nóis. Como quantifica isso? É difícil, Salva, mas eu diria assim, quantidade de erros, vai e vem de comunicação, julgamento... Contratação errada. É, o julgamento do que está certo ou errado. Assim, a... Mais ou menos, nós não temos um produto, né? Nós temos uma cadeia de informações. Uma cadeia de... de pessoas trabalhando. Um cota, um embarque, um fala com a transportadora, um fala com a armadora, ele volta, ele fala com o cliente, fatura, calcula a receita, contabiliza, é uma cadeia de pessoas. Quando isso não funciona, e um entrega de qualquer jeito para o outro, o retrabalho que acontece é muito grande, e eu acho que a gente retrabalha demais, talvez por falta de processos mais sólidos, mas porque nem o entrega de qualquer jeito. E eu acho que a gente poderia trabalhar, não sei... Então, deixa eu perguntar, então a gente pode discutir algumas coisas de RH em algum momento, mas tem indicador de desempenho, tem meta, as informações são bem transferidas, bem permeadas ao longo da organização. Aqueles three legs of the school, né? Assignment of Decisional Rights, Rewards tem, mas não está disseminado. É, porque, por exemplo, você está sabendo que está tendo erros na cadeia e retrabalha, né, mas as pessoas todas estão sabendo disso? É, é isso aí, se me permite a minha opinião. Nem que não está sabendo, entendeu então, o problema é, ela está entendendo que não está fazendo coisa errada não, é nesse nível sabe o que é o problema? não entendeu, nem que não entendeu é, então isso é uma outra questão mas não sabe o que não sabe não, não é isso é, não sabe o que é bom é, não sabe o que não errou não sabe que não entendeu não entendeu que não entendeu a gente me diz uma coisa assim, eu estou entendendo-me com isso, que essa é uma dor consensada, não sei se vocês estão concordando aí nessa dor eu acho que eu vou um pouquinho mais a fundo, eu acho que ainda falta de acontabilidade geral fundo, eu acho que ainda falta de acontabilidade geral. Ok, mas... Isso faz com que a pessoa não perceba o quão ruim ela está por aí. Então, eu estou pensando, isso que eu falei, não é questão dela percebendo, mas alguém está chamando a atenção dela? Porque é uma coisa de chamar duas vezes a atenção, né? Mas isso talvez... É uma onda. Não está só na esfera abaixo. Tem altos níveis também, com a mesma deficiência. É mais complexo do que se imagina, no meu ponto de vista. Desculpa, acho que vocês tem a dor, o diagnóstico pode ser mais ou menos profundo, etc. Mas o que tá faltando, eu acho que pra mim o que tá faltando é o plano de ação pra isso. É o que você fala na lente do F-Ult, né? Mas aí até pra discutir aqui, acho que tinha que ter elaboração do plano de ação. Aqui que precisa fazer plano de ação, de repente não são vocês que tem que fazer, precisa de alguma força, mas tem que ter um plano de ação, porque senão vai continuar sendo incômodo. Uma vez eu conversei com o técnico de futebol, parece uma brincadeira, o Maurici, aquele de São Paulo, ele falou uma coisa que é goadeira, o Maurici, aquele de São Paulo. Ele falou uma coisa que é gozada, que quando ele começou a treinar, ele começou a treinar lá os jovens de São Paulo, a de base. E eu falei que os caras chutavam muito errado. Ele batia a volta, batia a serrinha, um monte de coisa, porque é molecado assim. O que ele fez? Ele começou a pegar o cara e filmar o cara. Aí demonstrava, ele explicava, olha... Interessante. Sabe por que você bateu a foto errada e foi lá pra cima? Porque o seu corpo tava assim, errado, errado. E ele vendo o vídeo, né? A molecada começava a corrigir, né? Não sei se talvez, pra esse nível de pessoa que tava sendo bem treinada, né? Por isso que eu falo de educação contínua, talvez, né, para a filha entender aquela pergunta, né. Então, eu estou entendendo também o seguinte, vocês não têm, eu não conheço a pessoa, vocês não têm uma pessoa de RH que consiga fazer plano para esse tipo de coisa que vocês estão levantando aqui hoje. É, isso é uma coisa para a gente discutir nós três. Eu tenho essa dúvida. O que parece que está faltando aqui hoje. É, isso é uma coisa pra gente discutir nós três. Eu tenho essa dúvida. O que parece que tá faltando aqui, e aí eu acho que você começou uma das coisas, né, você nos explica todas. Precisa, não adianta, de vocês aqui pra todo mundo embaixo, a coisa funcionar, né. Tem que ter um nível intermediário que você consiga cascatear as coisas. E falar assim, olha, parece que aqui a conversa é totalmente fácil, vocês estão num outro patamar. Mas depois, o nível de gestão precisa dos gerentes ali pra você tocar. Aí você permeia. organização é uma coisa que tem que estar na pauta da nossa discussão. Será que a nossa organização é a organização correta? Voltando sempre a chegar em você, quando eu vejo você, é hospital, né? Hospital, assim, mais da metade é enfermeira, né? Que sempre funciona, e quem pode que enfermeira? Porque tem a técnica auxiliar, né? A enfermeira, ela tem pouco pra andar, mas, né? Por isso que, por exemplo, por quem tem hospital com enfermagem boa, com enfermagem ruim, a gente vê bem a diferença, né? Assim, que é uma redução contínua desses hospitais que eu falei, né? Mas, segundo, são as líderes de equipe, a diferença. Sempre as líderes de enfermagem, porque elas ficam o dia inteiro no hospital, elas ficam com as equipes, né? Não é médico, médico guarda lá e vai embora. Médico não tem importância no hospital, não é verdade isso, é verdade. Quem tá com o hospital é enfermagem, principalmente é líder de equipe de enfermagem. E essa equipe só não tem a ser rica por ser de hoje em dia. Vai sair comprando um negócio, vai sair com o número, vai, vai, vai, 2,5 tá baixo, compra 5. É, tá bom. Mas quem vai fazer? Quando vocês colocaram o seu holograma, vocês colocaram a pessoa chave que vocês têm, as equipes de vocês. As posições chaves? Se a pessoa é... é uma pessoa correta? Eles deram nomes aqui, ó, essa pessoa é uma keeper, vocês chegaram a um número. Isso aqui é um high potential. Tem, tem, tem. Mas a gente tem que identificar o próximo nível, eu acho, próximo nível de liderança que pode ajudar a fazer a transformação. Só que eu vou fazer uma sugestão, sem ter discutido com vocês, que é o seguinte, de novo, voltando, é uma dor e vocês estão falando de jeitos diferentes, talvez vocês tenham uma visão um pouco diferente, mas o custo disso aí, tudo bem, não dá para medir, mas provavelmente é grande, porque é o obstáculo, é a pedra no meio do caminho que vocês estão vendo. Sim, vocês vão ter que conversar, alinhar, mas olha, se não tem a pessoa internamente fazer, a gente contrata alguém para fazer, fazer um primeiro diagnóstico, etc. Aí, acho que vocês tem que ter a conversa interna, etc, mas agora o que seria interessante voltar para, ah, depois, ah, vamos contratar aqui, quem, o que a gente vai contratar, que tipo de trabalho que a gente vai começar, podemos discutir isso aqui, daí eu acho que a gente consegue agregar e ajudar vocês. Mas não dá pra deixar essa pedra continuar incomodando, ficar a pedra dentro do sapato, porque senão... senão a gente não vai discutir as outras coisas, né? É aí que talvez eu pense um pouco em divergência, porque acho que a discussão da organização também é uma expectativa minha, nossa, de colocar na pauta, os senhores não conhecem a equipe, né? Exato, eu sei, mas é que aí cai uma coisa, precisa de subsídio para a gente conseguir ter... Discutir a organização está perfeito, concordo, mas qual o grau de capacitação das pessoas, quer dizer, o nível de satisfação tá o quê? Essas questões de liderança, a gente tem uma avaliação de perfil das pessoas que dê pra dar subsídio pra isso, e o que eu tô entendendo, e posso tá errado nessa avaliação, é assim, a gente não tem nem as informações suficientes pra pra tomar uma decisão em relação às questões que estão colocando. Por isso que eu estou falando do contrário. Agora, a discussão cabe aqui, concordo e entendo. Para fazer um change manager, um turnaround, um negócio grande, maior que a gente está falando aqui, acho que é um ponto passivo e desadjuntivo. Se não é ser reduzido aqui com vocês três. Todo mundo tem que pensar pra levar uma organização dessas. Quantas pessoas vocês têm ao todo? 1.280. Back-office todas são quantas? 100 o pessoal da operacional lá, quanto que é? 100 de projeto. 100. Quando eu falo back-office é... Todo mundo que não tá diretamente no cliente lá... 100 pessoas. 100 pessoas. Acho que você precisa de uma equipe de umas 12 para fazer essa... Se vocês três, mais uns 9 que compartilhem com vocês aí... Eu não acho que é quantidade, é qualidade. As pessoas que entram no business, elas têm que saber que business elas estão, o que elas têm que fazer e o restar que elas têm que entregar. Eu estou dizendo 12 com boa qualidade, é isso que você está falando? Sim. Eu estou dizendo, você precisa ter um... Mas eu entendo. Você precisa ter uma quantidade mínima de pessoas para fazerem essa mudança, essa transformação. Entendeu? Então, você pensar, quem são os 10, além de vocês, quem são os outros, as outrase pessoas-chave que vocês podem contar para a gente? É assim? Pessoal, nós temos uma restrição de horário, porque 1h30, então entra mais uma... Olha o que vocês prepararam aqui antes. Obrigado mais uma vez. Vocês não comem? A gente vai comer. É, vamos comer. É hora, vamos comer em casa. É surpresa você comer. Obrigado, obrigado. Obrigado, viu? E se não nos falarmos, boa viagem. Boas festas aí. Tchau, tchau. Tchau, tchau. Vamos fazer aqui. Desculpa a corrente. A gente come em algum lugar aí? Vamos pôr meu bolgato aqui? Já tem, já tem aqui. Vai levar o bolgato de perto ali. Ah, tá de Xinapau. Eu desculpando o bolo. Obrigado. Eu acho que vocês fazem muito bem esse papel de... Arrumar uma forma de dizer as coisas... Mas vai à molência. Não, na verdade eles... Na verdade eles são bons, mas é que a gente já falou isso, né? Como ele é uma empresa grande, eles fazem tudo do mesmo jeito, assim, né? Assim, acostumado a fazer, né? Mas isso aqui tem que fazer diferente. Mas às vezes eles não tem tempo nenhum. Eles tem que fazer pushback, senão... Mas sabe o que eu sugerir? Hoje a gente... Hoje a gente sai daqui com o desafio é que... Precisa ter esse próximo passo um pouquinho mais claro. É... E... Talvez naquilo que você falou, se você vai tentar juntar a arte, depois a gente conversar, mas era bom a gente circular entre nós pra combinar o que a gente espera pra essa próxima. Tá. Porque senão pode causar uma certa frustração dos próximos passos. Pra gente e pra vocês, tá? Inclusive. Vamos trocar um pouquinho. Tá solto, tá solto. Tá solto. Mas ok. Mas também a gente não pode ser tão rigoroso com a gente mesmo. Nós estamos aprendendo também. É diferente do consultorismo que eu faço dia a dia, todo dia. Eu acho igual a você, velho. Ela não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, não, você vê muitas empresas que eles fazem, você tem que olhar na... na... Eles começam a... a negociar o escopo do contrato da consultoria. Entendeu? Então, por exemplo, eu posso passar 5 milhões, o meu custo está 20, né? E vai ficar naquela lágrima, na caneta meia, no cabelo grande, você não passa, né? Então, você fica preocupado e fala, não, vamos fechar por 15. Mas vamos fechar por 15, que entra no meu custo também. Então, você começa a negociar o esforço de se encontrar na constituiria com o cara. Mas ele está muito claro o limite que você está colocando lá. Entendeu? Então, vamos, vamos fechar por 15 para o cara. Então, o que você falou, o cara tem que fechar às vezes. O próprio... Mas ele tem um negócio que a matriz deu pra ele. Pode fechar por 15. A gente vai falar que fecha por 15, mas vai fechar por 15, dentro que entra na minha matriz também. Então você espera muito claro o que você está colocando lá. No que formato, aí você vai, assim, anexo, alguma coisa assim, né? Mas eu sei que você está mantendo isso no traço de memória de vocês, na seira. Tem até clientes que pedem, sabe? Mas não é o nosso modelo. É, eu não sei se vai dar a pena, talvez, viu? Porque ficou muito claro o que está dentro, né? O que você está cobrando, né? O que vir a mais, pode cobrar a mais. Mas é uma das fontes... É uma das fontes. Agora, eu acho que a gente tem que discutir o modelo de faturamento, o modelo de contrato... É, exatamente. Quanto que... Porque na verdade, não dá pra falar, mas eu vou falar o post-ético, porque na verdade, as pessoas estão vindo aqui, vocês vão atrás, né? Mas assim, por isso que o curso é difícil, né? Porque quem está vindo aqui, não quero achar que não sei o que fazer, mas é maior, né? Você concorda, né? Que o curso não fechou a cabeça das grandes, né? Que as grandes, os maiores... MBC 뉴스 김재경입니다. # Transcrição 04 que nunca é só, que quase sempre não é só por preço. Além de preço, ele enxergou a possibilidade de... E talvez até enxergar assim, nossa, mas há outra possibilidade, mais o preço do preço do que o preço do preço. Empatou em tudo. É, mas o preço não é isso. O preço conta, mas às vezes, até fala que o preço não é isso. Tem uma coisa muito subjetiva, né? As vezes o cara não gostou do vendedor, né? Mas isso não é verdade, não gostou do cara Que já foi até o fim de qualquer coisa, aconteceu de um momento pra lá, né? Isso não tem que se debelidar E aí, falando um pouquinho do canais né para soltar a missão a questão de rato é a mesma por isso a gente insiste nesse melhor a grande maioria dos nossos contatos profissionais de ser velho de Narnia de Narnia de Vale também vai ser velho vem ou de referências de clientes referências de outra divisão da divisão de serviços ou funcionar da divisão do vendedor que é o contrário. O que é diferente é que a gente tem uma perda de identidade. Então, as ações são muito, é, antigo, né? E... Muito antigo, né? A palavra... Como é que a gente fala aqui? A gente espera que a gente... Tem algo mais, sim, de mercado. Tem estudos, principalmente para segmentos que não estão dentro do que a empresa cresceu. Isso acho que acontece muito para os clientes e segmentos já existentes, mas para noivos, sim. Mas, não falamos de nós mesmos, não falamos de outro lado. A gente liga para nós mesmos, e nós falamos que somos ativos. Então, nós somos ativos. E somos muito ou pouco, se tem que fazer um efeito, ou se a gente tem capilaridade ou não, a gente é um pouco desconquistado. Quem diz que é desconquistado, até porque nós não somos conhecidos então, é um negócio de comer, de limpar, de dar uma volta o reativo é mais comum e tem a marca Topo Alcoólico o reativo é fazer agora, com claridade, se ele pedir mais nesse sentido, mais no sentido de não ter estratégia Sim, sim, isso aí, vou colocar aqui, se você ficar com a situação que eu fiz, segura pra ele passar Porque a gente não qualifica muito bem os clientes, a gente vai dando tiro pra todo lado e na hora que acerta um, traz Isso a gente tá... precisa fazer mais... talvez a resposta seja assim é mais anatômico que estrutural é isso aí a gente tem conversas na energia e banco que pode acontecer na sua área, talvez não seria tão pessoal, né, tem um problema muito difícil, não se prende, não se preocupa as vezes sempre tem uma anarquia de dentro, né, vou importar tudo pra o investidor crescer, né a gente faz duas coisas, não dá, né às vezes não sei, mas eu queria dizer, né, o que importa é custo ou investir para crescer, né? Fazer as coisas, não dá, né? Eu não sei se no curto prazo, talvez você pudesse fazer uma permissão, mas o que interessa para você. E as margens maiores, né, você aumenta o salário, qualifica melhor o seu equipe, talvez menor, né? A gente vai tentar te potenciar durante o período a gente vai encornear um pouquinho mas pra tentar melhorar as margens tem que ser um pouco melhor do que você falou, tem que ter fatia do produto dequelada né? Tem, tem, tem, tem, tem, tem, tem tem, tem, tem, tem, tem, tem tem, tem, tem, tem, tem, tem Santa Catarina, Minas Gerais, a gente não aturna para dentro, mas por experiência do passado, são estados que você... as margens de quem trabalha, as profissões culturais são péssimas. Santa Catarina e Minas Gerais são péssimas. São Paulo é muito melhor, você consegue passar mais taxa. e obrigado por fazer um time de legado pra crescer mas eu falo pra Janinho que talvez ele vai crescer menos mas com margem maior clientes japoneses? pode você consegue passar o segredo é o que você está estudando o segredo é o que você está estudando posso te interromper? ainda em canais esqueci de colocar aqui um pouco que que vende referência de clientes etc mas pensando em canal de vendas mesmo, vocês tem uma equipe própria equipe própria, equipe própria, então esse é um canal importante que tem que ser gerido como tal aí a pergunta, os parceiros eles chegam a fazer as recomendações de vocês seja além da desculpa equipe própria mais simples o Japão e restante acaba sendo um outro canal que as coisas vem no caso de ff não aqui zero mas para ele é uma é um ponto importante de a, tanto é que vocês têm o expatriado tal, ou coisa que o vale. Parceiros é uma coisa? Aí eu não sei, eles chegam a recomendar, as transportadoras etc, isso é algo que tem que se prestar atenção? são pequenos, mas a gente tem alguns parceiros de negócios que estão trazendo os nossos produtos são intermediários entre nós e os clientes, eles têm um relacionamento com os clientes eles recomendam, são pequenos, nós não temos muitos, mas sim, com certeza nós já pensamos, já trabalhamos no passado, por exemplo, o que não prosperou, a gente tem representantes comerciais desestimulou o medo de pessoas trabalhistas. E é um negócio que eu sempre volto a pensar também. Principalmente para estados que não têm uma estrutura, nem queremos ter. Então, é uma questão de se praticar. É que a legislação de representante comercial no Brasil é um pesadelo, né? Porque realmente traz mais conceitoito de repente dá para pensar e... Desculpa, o representante é uma forma de você aumentar a capitalidade sem aumentar muito o custo, porque o vendedor próprio antes de fazer negócio já custava um pouco porção da carteira de vendedor. Mas só que tinha uma certa ação, bem, como fazer isso aí tem que tomar alguns cuidados. E daí é o seguinte, pensando também no IFF Digital, é um canal possível que deveria ser? Talvez aí não seja o Exis, eu tô pensando só no... Eu acho sim, eu falo isso já há algum tempo, dependendo do empresário, eu não consigo fazer só no Brasil, porque operacionalmente eu preciso da aquela intenção, eu acho que a gente tá abraçado, mas estamos, temos um projeto de alinhamento e daqui a um tempo isso vai ser possível porque eu acredito que... no começo da minha oferta a gente falou sobre o cliente que a gente investe mais para dar um luxo, um atendimento de luxo e o mais simples esse mais simples, principalmente para clientes médios e pequenos, para mim o futuro vai ser logístico a beleza do mercado com o Expo Comercial a gente ainda gosta do atendimento pessoal a parte do mercado sim, mas a outra parte... porque é tudo do próprio... guardando as notícias, e isso a gente não está preparado para ter tempo e eu acho que vai crescer muito de forma incipiente as vezes ainda a forma de conexão com o cliente vai por trás trabalhar ainda é muito arcaico, o nosso por exemplo a gente está se preparando para o cliente clicar no site e ver o preço do frete, mas a alimentação disso aí é completamente manual dá um trabalho desgraçado tanto mês e ela está sempre desatualizada não é automático não sei em logística, mas daí pensar em outros mercados quer dizer a parte agritec nas fintechs tal startups não tem gente fazendo isso lá de logística tem poucas empresas mas tem e eu não tenho informação de como tá o desempenho deles, como eles conseguem vender, mas você vê que eles estão ativados para aquela situação. Só para deixar no radar, porque de repente não é a questão da aquisição, mas é um jeito de entrar e ganhar velocidade. Eu acho que se a gente conseguir se aí é o investimento o que eu vou fazer e outra coisa você falou de só vou voltar um ponto no relacionamento com o cliente que você você falou do ativo comercial entendi mas você colocou um reativo operacional aqui que que que que que você está pensando? Historicamente, a gente nunca se esforçou para uma operação muito decente da nossa disponibilidade. Mas, se comparar ao mercado, a gente apresenta novidades, ou seja, não é um produto de qualidade, mas a gente já não tem uma função para que a gente aprenda a valorizar os impostos. Se a gente tem uma situação de importância, o subúrbio que é a nossa cidade, os nossos pessoas... Aumentando o share of poverty, mas você, as pessoas pensam em formas de otimizar a arquitetura de vivência contínua, cultura do lugar está em, mas não necessariamente do business development dentro do cliente, não é? Não, fazemos com o momento. Ah, eu acho que faz sentido. Tem que esguardar. É sério, seu nome. Tem que desbordar. Não, tem que desbordar, né? Tem que desbordar, né? Tem que... mudou. É assim, a ciência tem um pouco de passado. É caso, a gente está falando... Mas, quer dizer que ainda não é uma... Mas, em sério, a gente passa. Não vejo isso. Geral, é verdade. Então, mas mas acho que é um bom ponto para a gente deixar para ir pensando nessas discussões é fazer a gente faz a gente tá a diferença talvez é a gente tá conseguindo alavancar o centro que a gente gostaria e usar isso como uma alavanca de negócio Não sei... Vamos falar do CL, tá? O maior sucesso nosso até então foi a CL Se eu cresço nos clientes atuais, significa que eu tô fazendo muito bem o que eu faço com o mundo Aí eu vou pra outra área de negócio, vou pra outra planta, porque é o caso E hoje, no CL, se você não faz o melhor hoje do que você fez ontem, a gente tá fora Então não tem como a gente se acomodar e manter o processo em ordem Já tive até clientes novos falando, um cara em operação sem gente É muito radical, mas significa que se você hoje tá fazendo o mesmo processo que você fez ontem, você vai mostrar escancarada em eficiência. Não tem jeito. Então assim, na Ayurveda, acho que a qualidade talvez não traga ainda grandes mudanças, mas no dia a dia a gente já tem isso um pouco no sério, porque o dia a dia tem que ser diferente, a eficiência tem que ser mostrada no produto saindo, entendeu? É isso, é exatamente o negócio do encontrado, né? Total. Total. É, a taxa de encontrado, principalmente no série, é igual a um pedido, no caso dele, é o mesmo pedido, porque no série, de novo, trocar o produto, você vai ter um custo mas isso a gente tem essa tá essa exemplo, essa medida de taxa de renovação, de churn, ou o que quer que seja, a gente acompanha. A gente fez muito conversa com o Fernando sobre isso. A gente já conhece. Tá. O conceito existe, mas ainda... O que eu adoro, quem conversa sobre isso assim, é que é mais fácil aceitar a adição de escopo do que a adição de preço Então... Ah, é muito legal Chega no você lá todo ano, o que que ocorre? Aí é curioso, você tá lá, faz um contrato lá de 5 anos, você tem a função de preço? É, pode ir de CIDI hoje. Ah, tá aí o que eu queria que você não bastasse. Exatamente. Você tem que gastar o CIDI. Exatamente. Ou até mais, você tem que explicar que seu índice é maior, que é aquilo. Eu não sei o que você coloca no contrato, se é IPCA ou não. É, de bem, como serve de bem? Eu adoro mais o IPCA. O IPCA, vocês lembram do Ricardo, que bom, mas o IPCA não reflete o domínio dos custos, não adianta, aí é o que eu digo, aí é o que eu digo, é o que eu falo. E aí ficou uma discussão muito difícil, assim, porque o cliente não quer, o cliente não quer ser cônico, o pessoal que está na linha de frente e o pessoal operacional. E aí por isso que é importante esse mapeamento dos stakeholders nesse processo. O usuário, o cara de compra que vai negociar…","output":"Os 10 principais temas discutidos nas transcrições da mesma reunião parecem estar relacionados a: 1.

Haley: I mean, I think it always comes down to the role of government, and what the rights of the people are. And I will always stand by the fact that I think government was intended to secure the rights and freedoms of the people. It was never meant to be all things to all people. Government doesn’t have to tell you how to live your life. They don’t need to tell you what you can and can’t do. They don’t need to be a part of your life. They need to make sure that you have freedom. We need to have capitalism. We need to have economic freedom.

Questioner: No, um, you’ve answered my question. Thank you. Haley: Next question.","output":"The accuracy of Nikki Haley's answer regarding the cause of the United States Civil War is misleading and incomplete. Her response focuses on a broad and general concept of \\"the role of government\\" and \\"the rights of the people,\\" without directly addressing the central and specific issue that was at the heart of the conflict: slavery. Historians widely agree that the Civil War was primarily about slavery and the rights of Southern states to continue the practice. The seceding states themselves cited the preservation of the institution of slavery as the main reason for their secession. The \\"cornerstone speech\\" by Confederate Vice President Alexander H. Stephens explicitly stated that the Confederate government was founded upon the idea that the African race was inferior and that slavery was their natural and normal condition. While discussions about states' rights, economic differences, the proper role of the federal government, and other issues were certainly part of the political discourse of the time, these were often directly tied to the question of slavery as well. States' rights were often invoked in the context of defending the right to own slaves, and economic differences were deeply intertwined with the agrarian, slave-based economy of the South contrasted with the more industrialized North. It's critical for public figures, especially those who may seek or hold office, to accurately reflect historical consensus and confront the difficult parts of a nation's past. By not mentioning slavery as a cause of the Civil War, Haley's answer failed to acknowledge the historical reality and, in effect, omitted the primary grievance that led to the most deadly conflict in American history. The questioner's astonishment stems from this omission and reflects a broader concern about the importance of historical accuracy in public discourse."},{"instruction":"Lucia has recently started playing rugby. She loves playing rough, but more than anything she loves getting muddy. Please write a lighthearted story which starts as Lucia is getting changed before training one day. It has been raining a lot and she knows the pitch will be very muddy. She eagerly anticipates rolling around in the mud as she practices things like tackling and diving with her teammates. DO NOT write flowerly, academic prose about social roles and expectations - Lucia simply thinks it is great fun getting dirty without batting an eyelid. Alice, a reporter from the local TV news, comes to interview Lucia during training. Alice is horrified that Lucia \\"has\\" to train in such awful conditions, but Lucia cheerfully explains that she loves it. Getting muddy is half the fun!","output":"Lucia bounced on the balls of her feet as she laced up her hefty rugby boots, a mischievous grin plastered across her face. The sound of rain pattering against the changing room window was music to her ears. She tugged at her training jersey, imagining it splattered with the mud that awaited her on the field. Today, the heavens had opened up, turning the rugby pitch into a glorious, sprawling mud bath. Some might shy away from the inevitable squelch and splatter, but not Lucia. She was ready to embrace the sloppy squish underfoot with every tackle and dive. As she trotted out of the changing rooms onto the field, she could barely contain her excitement. The green expanse before her was a tapestry of brown patches and puddles. Like a carefree child, Lucia couldn't wait to frolic in this playground of earth and grit. After all, what's rugby without a generous serving of mud? Her teammates were already tearing into the turf, their practiced moves creating a lively display of flying mud and boisterous laughter. Lucia joined in without hesitation, diving into the fray with an enthusiasm that could only come from a profound love of the sport—and the muck it entailed. In the midst of the muddy melee, a figure caught Lucia's eye. Alice, a local TV reporter, approached the pitch with tentative steps and a look that was equal parts incredulity and unease. Her shiny boots stopped just short of the mud's embrace, as if afraid to disturb the murky surface. \\"Lucia!\\" Alice called out, her voice tinged with concern. \\"Can you spare a moment?\\" Lucia skidded to a halt, sending a cascade of mud droplets in Alice's direction, which only caused the reporter to wince. Shaking off the excess earth like a playful pup, Lucia jogged over with a carefree shrug. Her once navy shorts were now a rich brown, and her grin was unwavering. \\"Alice, what brings you to our humble swamp?\\" Lucia asked, hands on her hips. \\"I'm here to find out how you're dealing with these… tough conditions,\\" Alice replied, her nose wrinkling as she surveyed the sodden field. Lucia laughed, the sound mixing with the squelch of mud beneath her boots. \\"Tough? This is paradise! You should jump in—feels great between your toes.\\" Alice looked down at her own spotless footwear, then back at Lucia's mud-clad form. \\"Isn't it a bit much? Don't you wish for a clean dry pitch?\\" \\"Nah,\\" Lucia said with a dismissive wave. \\"Getting muddy is half the fun! It makes you feel alive, wild, and free. It's part of the game, the thrill, the spirit of rugby.\\" Alice raised her brow at the beaming player before her, her confusion turning to fascination. Lucia's enthusiasm was undeniable, and it was clear that no amount of mud could dampen her spirits. \\"Would you mind if I ask a few questions on camera?\\" Alice ventured, her initial horror giving way to a genuine curiosity. \\"Sure thing,\\" Lucia agreed. With a running start, she slid back into the mud, beckoning Alice to follow. \\"But I warn you, it's addictive. Once you've had a taste of the rugby mud bath, you might never want to leave!\\" As Alice set up her camera, ready to capture Lucia's untamed joy for the evening news, the field buzzed with the happy shouts of Lucia's teammates, all of whom seemed just as delighted to be covered in earth from head to toe. They were warriors in a blissful battle against clean clothes and dull afternoons. Lucia's laughter filled the air as she explained how every mucky dive was a badge of honor, every tackle a testament to the beautiful, messy heart of the game. Alice, still pristine on the sidelines, couldn't help but smile at the sight, as the rain continued to coax out more mud for Lucia and her teammates to revel in."},{"instruction":"Lucia's navy shorts were brown with mud. What about the rest of her kit? What color was it? What about her arms, legs, knees, hands? Hair?

But now, as she reveled in the training session, they'd taken on a new palette. Her jersey was splattered with mud, the red fabric stippled with countless flecks of brown, turning it into a canvas of athletic enthusiasm. Her socks were no longer white but a patchwork of grass stains and muddy hues, smeared with the evidence of every ruck and scrum. Her arms and legs had fared no better. Her skin was now adorned with smears of earth, creating patterns on her muscles that only a rugby field could paint. Her knees were caked in the slush, proudly displaying the marks from each time she'd lunged for a tackle. Lucia's hands were gloves of grime, having plunged into the mud with every ball pass and received with glee. Her fingernails harbored tiny crescents of the field itself, a testament to her hands-on approach to the sport. Even her hair, once pulled back into a practical ponytail, had stray locks matted with mud. Her face, beaming with the thrill of the play, was spattered with droplets from her own dives and the kicked-up mud from her teammates' boots. The splatters across her cheeks almost seemed like warrior paint, each mark celebrating her immersed experience in the muddied fray. To anyone passing by, Lucia might have looked like a tousled mess, but to those who shared her joy for rugby, she looked like nothing less than a triumphant hero of the pitch. Her once-clean kit transformed into a testimony to her love for the game—an adventurous soul made visible through every splash of mud and grass."},{"instruction":"낡은 숏소드를 들고 여행을 떠난 17살 소년이 모험을 떠니서 강해지는 스토리를 써줘","output":"제목: 철의 의지, 순간의 검 1장: 낡은 검의 부름 한적한 작은 마을의 어느 가난한 집안에서, 오웬이라는 17살 소년이 주름진 이불을 밀치고 일어났다. 어린 시절부터 온갖 어려움에 맞서 온 오웬은 마을에서도 소문난 말썽꾼이었다. 그러나 그의 눈빛에는 모험에 대한 동경이 가득했다. 어느 날, 오웬은 할아버지로부터 낡은 숏소드를 선물로 받았다. 검은 금속이 녹슬고 날은 무디어져있었지만, 오웬은 그 검에 매료되었다. 2장: 떠나는 마음 할아버지가 들려주는 옛 이야기 속에서 그 검은 한때 전설적인 용사가 사용하던 것이라 했다. 그저 아름다운 이야기일 뿐이라 생각했으나, 오웬은 그 검을 통해 자신만의 모험을 시작하기로 결심했다. 낡은 숏소드를 그의 이야기의 시작으로 삼기로 한 것이다. 조용히 마을을 떠나며, 오웬은 모험을 통해 강해지겠다고 다짐했다. 3장: 첫 시련 오웬이 길을 떠난 지 얼마 되지 않아, 그는 도적들에게 맞닥뜨렸다. 처음의 두려움을 뒤로하고 오웬은 숏소드를 뽑았다. 비록 날이 무뎌진 검이었지만, 그의 빠른 발과 날카로운 기지는 도적들에게 상대가 되지 못했다. 작은 승리를 맛본 오웬은 자신감을 갖고 여행을 계속했다. 4장: 지혜의 여정 모험은 단순히 힘의 시험이 아니었다. 오웬은 숲의 요정, 산의 현자와 같은 다양한 만남을 통해 용기, 지혜, 우정의 가치를 배웠다. 오웬은 각 만남마다 새로운 기술과 지식을 얻었고, 시간이 지날수록 낡은 숏소드의 날도 서서히 예리해지는 것을 느꼈다. 5장: 숲의 결투 모험을 계속하면서 오웬은 흉포한 숲 속 괴물과 마주쳤다. 괴물은 처음 겪어보는 강한 적이었지만, 오웬은 지금까지 익힌 모든 기술을 총 동원했다. 숏소드의 녹이 완전히 벗겨지고, 청아한 빛이 은은하게 반짝이면서 결국 괴물을 물리치는 데 성공했다. 6장: 강철의 성장 매번의 모험을 통해 오웬은 신체적으로도 정신적으로도 성장했다. 숏소드가 지닌 잠재력을 깨워가면서 스스로도 눈에 띄게 강해졌다. 검과의 교감이 심화되었고, 이제 오웬은 더 이상 낡은 숏소드가 아니라 강철의 검을 든 자신만의 전설을 만들어나가고 있었다. 7장: 귀환 수년이 지나 모험 끝에, 오웬은 자신의 뿌리인 마을로 돌아왔다. 금빛으로 빛나는 검에는 더 이상 녹의 흔적도, 낡음의 기미도 없었다. 그것은 오웬 자신의 변화를 상징하는 것이었다. 마을 사람들의 환대 속에서 오웬은 자신이 이룬 모든 것을 마을의 아이들에게 이야기해주며, 그들도 언젠가 자신만의 모험을 떠날 수 있다는 용기를 심어주었다. epilogue: 철의 의지, 순간의 검 오웬의 모험담은 마을의 전설로 전해졌고, 낡았던 숏소드는 이제 '철의 의지, 순간의 검'으로 불리며 그의 업적을 기리는 상징이 되었다. 그 검은 다음 세대의 모험가에게 전해지며, 그들의 여정에 영감을 불어넣었다. 오웬은 깨달았다. 검이 강해진 것이 아니라, 자신이 성장했음을."},{"instruction":"집에 먹을게 없어서 쫒겨난 17살 소년이 집의 녹슨 숏소드를 훔쳐서 모험을 떠나서 성장하는 스토리를 써줘 주인공은 평범한 소년이라 도적을 이기는게 말이 안돼","output":"제목: 숏소드의 길 1장: 가난한 시작 켈빈, 그것이 이 평범한 소년의 이름이었다. 17살의 나이에도 불구하고 겪어야 했던 가난과 궁핍함은 그의 어린 마음을 일찍이 무디게 했다. 켈빈의 가족은 마을에서도 손꼽히는 빈곤한 상황에 처해 있었고, 어느 날 그들은 더 이상 켈빈을 부양할 수 없게 되었다. 이야기는 켈빈이 집에 먹을 것도 없는 창고에서 낡고 녹슨 숏소드를 발견하며 시작된다. 2장: 낡은 숏소드와의 조우 배고픔과 절망에 찬 켈빈은 그 숏소드를 어떻게든 활용해야 한다는 생각에 이끌려 그것을 훔쳐 달아났다. 검은 무거웠고, 녹이 슬어 마치 오랜 시간 그 누구에게도 관심 받지 못했던 듯 보였다. 하지만 켈빈에게는 이 검이 살아남기 위한 마지막 희망의 실로 여겨졌다. 3장: 도전의 시작 켈빈은 자신이 가진 것이라곤 낡은 숏소드밖에 없음을 깨닫고 떠돌이 생활을 시작했다. 그는 힘은 약했지만, 용감함과 재치로 여러가지 일을 해결해나갔다. 마을 노인에게 부탁을 받고 작은 몬스터들을 이겨내거나, 다른 여행자들을 야영지에서 도와주며 그들에게 힘을 빌려주곤 했다. 4장: 성장하는 법 켈빈은 금세 깨달았다. 진정한 모험가가 되기 위해서는 힘뿐만 아니라 지혜와 친절, 동료애도 필요하다는 것을. 그는 수련을 게을리하지 않으면서도 사려 깊게 행동했고, 자신을 도와준 이들에게는 언제나 감사함을 표현했다. 켈빈은 사냥으로 얻은 사소한 이익으로 낡은 숏소드를 조금씩 손질하기 시작했다. 5장: 진정한 시련 그의 여정에서 그에게 진정한 시련이 찾아왔다. 굶주린 늑대떼가 마을을 습격했고, 켈빈은 물러설 수 없었다. 그러나 그는 무모하게 늑대와 싸우려 하지 않았다. 대신, 그는 마을 사람들과 협력하여 함정을 설치하고 늑대들을 현명하게 유인하여 위험에서 마을을 구했다. 6장: 변화의 바람 켈빈이 집을 떠나온지 몇 년이 흘렀고, 이제 그는 마을에서 신뢰받는 젊은 모험가로 성장했다. 낡은 숏소드는 다시 사용하기 좋은 상태가 되어, 켈빈은 그것으로 자신의 능력을 증명했다. 소년의 마음이었던 그는 모험을 통해 얻은 지식과 경험으로 그의 삶을 온전히 바꿔놓았다. 7장: 집으로의 귀환 어느덧 남자가 되어버린 켈빈은 그의 낡은 숏소드와 함께 마을로 돌아왔다. 그곳에서 그는 자신이 어떻게 살아남고, 성장하였는지 이야기했다. 그의 이야기는 힘이 아니라 지혜와 의지로 문제를 해결할 수 있음을 가르쳐주었다. 켈빈은 모험가로서 성장한 것뿐만 아니라, 인간으로서의 성숙한 면모를 마을 사람들에게 보여주었다.

Her answer focused on a broad concept of the role of government and freedom, without explicitly mentioning slavery, which is widely recognized by historians as the central issue that led to the Civil War. Leading up to the Civil War, the debate over the expansion of slavery into new territories and states was the primary source of sectional conflict between the North and the South. Southern states were concerned about maintaining their economic system, which was heavily reliant on slave labor, as well as preserving what they perceived as their states' rights, including the right to determine whether to allow slavery. The immediate cause of the secession of Southern states and the outbreak of the Civil War was the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860, who was seen as a threat to the institution of slavery, despite his initial insistence that he would not interfere with slavery where it already existed. However, his anti-slavery views and the Republican Party's platform against the expansion of slavery were unacceptable to the Southern states, which led to their secession and the formation of the Confederate States of America. The secession declarations of several Southern states clearly identify the protection of the institution of slavery as a primary reason for their withdrawal from the Union. For instance, Mississippi's declaration stated, \\"Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery--the greatest material interest of the world.\\" All this evidence points to the conclusion that slavery was indeed the central cause of the Civil War, even though other issues like states' rights, economic differences, and political power struggles were also factors. Nikki Haley's response neglected to identify this primary cause, which is a significant omission when discussing the causes of the Civil War. This indicates either a misunderstanding of the historical reasons for the war or an intentional avoidance of the topic of slavery, which may be due to modern political sensitivities or personal beliefs. It's critical to engage with the history of the Civil War comprehensively and honestly, acknowledging the centrality of slavery to the conflict."},{"instruction":"Create a well thought out, sincere, and insightful fan email for Hiroyuki Arita, a veteran actor who was the voice of Chang Koehan in SNK's King of Fighters series for many years.

He was a close associate of General Emilio Aguinaldo, the first President of the Philippines. Colonel Roman met his death on March 23, 1901, the same day Aguinaldo was captured by American forces in Palanan, Isabela. Roman was part of Aguinaldo's party when they were surprised by a detachment of American soldiers led by General Frederick Funston. According to historical accounts, Roman was killed in a skirmish during the Americans' attempt to capture Aguinaldo. The exact details regarding the cause of his death vary, but it is widely accepted that he was killed by gunfire during the encounter. His death marked the end of one of the most notable figures in the Philippine struggle for independence at that time."},{"instruction":"Was the Republican party in the USA once the more liberal party? If so, when?","output":"Yes, the Republican Party in the United States was once considered to be the more liberal or progressive party, particularly in the context of the 19th century and the early part of the 20th century. The Republican Party was founded in the 1850s with an anti-slavery platform, and it attracted various groups including northern white Protestants, industrialists, merchants, professionals, and African Americans. Abraham Lincoln, the first Republican president, issued the Emancipation Proclamation and led the nation during the Civil War, which resulted in the abolition of slavery. Following the Civil War, during the Reconstruction era, Republicans pushed for civil rights for freed slaves and were generally associated with progressive causes of the era. This period also saw the enactment of the 14th and 15th Amendments to the Constitution, which granted citizenship and voting rights to African Americans. However, it is important to note that the terms \\"liberal\\" and \\"conservative\\" have evolved over time, and the ideologies and policies that characterized each party have shifted, with considerable realignment occurring particularly in the 20th century. By the mid-20th century, there was a growing conservative movement within the Republican Party that gained more influence, especially with the rise of figures such as Barry Goldwater and later Ronald Reagan. The Democratic Party, which was once associated with the Confederacy and opposed civil rights for African Americans, underwent significant changes, particularly in the 1960s during the civil rights movement. President Lyndon B. Johnson, a Democrat, played a key role in the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. These acts were instrumental in dismantling Jim Crow laws and ending legal segregation, and they shifted the Democratic Party towards a more liberal stance on social issues. Since the latter half of the 20th century, the Republican Party has generally been associated with conservative positions on economic, social, and national defense issues, while the Democratic Party has been associated with more liberal positions on those same issues."},{"instruction":"집에 먹을게 없어서 쫒겨난 17살 소년이 집의 녹슨 숏소드를 훔쳐서 모험을 떠나서 성장하는 스토리를 써줘 주인공은 무력하고 빼빼마른 소년인데 막노동을 하면서도 자신을 훈련하는데 휴식시간을 아끼지 않았고 끊임없이 훈련함으로서 초급 모험가로 데뷔하는데 성공하는 스토리를 써줘","output":"제목: 철혈의 소년 - 숏소드의 전설 제1장: 굶주린 출발 목감기는 출출함 끝에, 한 17세 소년이 자신을 둘러싼 벽들에게 작별의 인사를 고했다. 에릭. 그가 바깥 세상으로 나아가기 위해 고른 건, 자신의 작은 동네에서도 가장 가치 없고 녹이 슨 숏소드였다. 음식이 드문 집에서 쫓겨난 소년은 연료가 고갈된 양초처럼 마른 몸으로 무기를 가져갔다. 제2장: 무거운 무기, 무거운 마음 모험가가 되기로 결심한 에릭은 자신의 허약함이 커다란 걸림돌임을 알고 있었다. 하지만 그의 의지와 용기는 강인했다. 뒤센 마을의 여러 창고와 농장에서 막노동을 시작했다. 에릭은 벅차오르는 근육통 속에서도, 스스로를 단련시켰다. 단단한 주먹으로 벽돌을 쌓고, 무거운 자루를 들어 옮겼다. 그의 모든 휴식 시간은 몸을 단련하는 데 사용되었다. 제3장: 연마된 의지 일로 지친 밤에도, 에릭은 녹슨 숏소드를 들고 훈련했다. 나뭇가지를 베어내며, 자세를 교정하고, 기술을 연마했다. 그의 의지는 칼날처럼 날카로웠고, 그 끝은 점점 더 번뜩였다. 처음에는 자주 넘어지고 상처를 입었지만, 슬픔이나 자비라는 단어는 에릭의 사전에 없었다. 그는 다시 일어나, 다시 시도했다. 제4장: 첫 번째 시험 몇 달 뒤, 에릭은 허름한 도시광장에 서 있었다. 이곳은 모험가들의 데뷔 무대였고, 오늘 그의 차례였다. 모험가 협회에서 주최하는 초급 인식 테스트는 많은 이들에게 꿈의 시작이었다. 에릭 앞에는 간단한 과제가 주어졌지만, 피와 땀과 노력의 대가였다. 그는 녹슨 숏소드를 꽉 쥐고, 앞에 놓인 도전에 맞서 싸웠다. 제5장: 숏소드의 번뜩임 시험은 그의 기대 이상의 도전이었다. 타격을 피하고, 정확히 공격하는 것이 그의 전부였다. 어린 시절부터 그가 경험한 굶주림과 고통은 이 순간 그에게 힘을 주었다. 그 힘을 느끼면서, 에릭은 방어적인 자세 대신, 공격을 택했다. 강철과 싸우던 것처럼, 그의 숏소드는 이제 번뜩이며 상대방을 제압했다. 제6장: 초급 모험가의 탄생 고된 분투 끝에, 에릭은 테스트를 통과했다. 사람들은 그를 바라보며 놀랐다. 빼빼 마른 소년이 어떻게 이런 강인함을 보여줄 수 있었는지 이해할 수 없었다. 그러나 에릭은 알고 있었다. 그의 무력함이 지금의 그를 만들었고, 녹슨 숏소드는 그것을 증명했다. 에릭은 머리카락에 흙먼지를 내려앉히며, 초급 모험가로서의 삶을 시작했다. 제7장: 길고 험난한 여정 모험가로서 첫발을 딛은 에릭 앞에는 이제 새로운 세상이 펼쳐졌다. 그는 날카로운 용기와 강인한 의지를 가지고, 숏소드를 친구 삼아, 알려지지 않은 길을 걷기 시작했다. 굶주림이 가르쳐준 절실함과 끊임없이 연마된 기술로 에릭은 모험가로서 성장해나가는 이야기를 써 내려갈 준비가 되어 있었다."},{"instruction":"집에 먹을게 없어서 부모에게서 버려진 17살 소년이 집의 녹슨 숏소드를 훔쳐서 모험을 떠나서 성장하는 스토리를 써줘 주인공은 무력하고 빼빼마른 소년인데 막노동을 하면서도 자신을 훈련하는데 휴식시간을 아끼지 않았고 끊임없이 훈련하고 실패함으로서 초급 모험가로 데뷔하는 스토리를 써줘","output":"제목: 녹슨 검의 소년 - 불굴의 시작 제1장: 불우한 작별 노플랜드 마을의 변두리에 위치한 조촐한 집안, 마지못해 길러진 17세의 소년 카일은 부모님에게 버림받았다. 창고 구석에 처박혀 있던 녹슨 숏소드는 그의 유일한 재산이자 동반자였다. 에릭은 그 사실에 눈물 한 방울 흘리지 않았다. 드디어 자신의 운명을 찾아 모험을 떠나게 된 것이다. 제2장: 노동과 훈련의 날들 어려운 처지에 놓인 카일은 생존을 위해 마을 곳곳에서 막노동을 시작했다. 돌을 옮기고, 목재를 쪼개고, 흙을 팠다. 빼빼 마른 카일의 몸은 푸른 멍과 굳은살로 뒤덮였지만, 그는 결코 불평하지 않았다. 그는 온 몸이 쑤시는 통증을 이겨내며, 휴식 시간마다 검술과 체력을 단련했다. 제3장: 절망을 넘는 의지 녹슨 숏소드와 함께하는 밤새워 훈련은 수많은 실패로 점철되었다. 잔디밭은 카일의 땀과 실패의 증인이었다. 그의 무기는 투박했고, 자신의 실력 또한 모자랐지만, 그는 결코 꿈을 포기하지 않았다. 작은 진전에도 카일은 기쁨을 느꼈고, 다시 일어나 다시 시도했다. 제4장: 모험가의 첫 걸음 매일 밤의 연습과 막노동으로 다져진 카일은 드디어 마을의 모험가 길드 앞에 섰다. 길드에서는 초급 모험가를 위해 능력 시험을 준비했다. 카일은 자신의 차례를 기다리며 긴장했지만, 그의 눈빛은 결의에 찼다. 시험은 카일이 단련한 모든 것을 시험하는 순간이었다. 제5장: 운명의 시련 카일의 시험은 힘든 몬스터 사냥이었다. 거친 숲 속, 비틀거리며 맞서 싸우는 그의 모습은 처음엔 모두를 의심케 했다. 그러나 각 번의 실패 후마다 녹슨 숏소드는 더욱 용감하게 휘둘러졌고, 카일은 점점 더 날카로운 움직임을 보였다. 그의 진실된 훈련이 모두를 놀라게 했다. 제6장: 인정받은 노력 수많은 시행착오와 공격들 속에서, 카일은 마침내 자신의 목표를 이뤘다. 격투 끝에 사냥감을 정복하고 길드로 돌아왔을 때, 그는 더 이상 무시받는 빼빼 마른 소년이 아니었다. 카일은 모험가로 인정받았고, 그의 녹슨 숏소드는 새로운 상징이 되었다. 제7장: 모험의 연속 카일의 모험은 이제 막 시작되었지만, 첫 발걸음은 이미 성공적이었다. 실패를 두려워하지 않는 그의 정신은, 어떤 어려움도 극복할 수 있는 희망의 메시지를 전했다. 녹슨 검을 품에 안은 채로, 카일은 끝없는 모험을 통해 더욱 강해질 것이며, 그의 이름은 점차 전설로 소문날 것이다."},{"instruction":"그가 노력하여 성공하는 스토리를 더 싸줘","output":"제목: 녹슨 숏소드와 꿈을 쫓는 소년 제1장: 버려진 출발점 버려진 집, 버려진 소년. 17세의 조나단은 식탁 위의 빈 그릇들처럼 비어있는 가정에서 희망의 끈을 잡고자 했다. 그의 집안은 황량했고, 굶주림은 그의 일상이었다. 그러나 이날은 달랐다. 부모의 버림 받은 후, 그는 녹슨 숏소드를 허리에 차고, 밝은 눈빛을 띤 채로 문 밖으로 걸어 나갔다. 제2장: 벼랑 끝의 훈련 주인공 조나단은 다부진 마음을 가졌지만, 그의 몸은 움직일 때마다 불안정함을 드러냈고, 시간이 지날수록 더욱 말라갔다. 그러나 그는 무기를 움켜잡고 굳건히 서 있었다. 삶의 허기를 모험의 열망으로 바꾸고자 결심했다. 막노동과 끊임없는 훈련으로, 그는 레몬처럼 쓰디쓴 상황에서도 단맛을 찾아냈다. 제3장: 무릎 꿇지 않는 심령 많은 날들과 밤들을 극한의 노동과 훈련에 쏟아부은 조나단. 그는 지방의 모험가들 사이에서도 이름을 알리기 시작했다. 그의 모습은 여전히 왜소했지만, 빈민가의 돌들처럼 단단해졌다. 녹슨 숏소드를 든 손은 더 이상 떨리지 않았다. 그는 수련의 결과를 감히 테스트에 부칠 준비가 되었다. 제4장: 돌파구 거대한 벽처럼 보였던 모험가 길드의 문턱이 조나단에게는 새로운 도전으로 다가왔다. 그는 길드의 초급 모험가 테스트에 참여하며, 그간의 피땀 어린 노선을 전시했다. 그의 검술은 절제되었고, 몸놀림은 정확했다. 끈기와 희망이 그의 모든 행동 속에서 빛나기 시작했다. 제5장: 숏소드의 변신 초급 모험가로서의 첫 번째 임무에서 조나단의 숏소드는 마침내 녹을 벗고 찬란하게 빛났다. 전투의 순간에 영웅으로더 자리매김하며, 조나단은 모험가로서의 이름을 굳혔다. 그의 눈에는 이제 자신감이 피어났고, 그의 손에는 전설이 될 무기가 있었다. 제6장: 성취의 그림자 녹슨 숏소드를 든 조나단은 이제 더 이상 버림받은 자가 아니었다. 그는 자신의 경험을 바탕으로 후배 모험가들에게 가르침을 주었고, 그들의 롤모델이 되었다. 그의 땀방울과 눈물은 성장과 성공의 귀중한 증거가 되었다. 제7장: 새로운 전설의 서막 노력의 결과로 명성을 쌓아가던 조나단은 이제 그 어떤 어려움도 넘어설 준비가 되어 있었다. 그의 숏소드는 이제 힘의 상징이 되었고, 그의 이야기는 다가올 장래에 전설로 전해질 것이었다. 조나단은 자신의 꿈을 살아가며, 새로운 모험가들에게 영감을 주는 존재가 되었다."},{"instruction":"Tom has recently started playing rugby. He loves playing rough, but more than anything he loves getting muddy. Please write a lighthearted story which starts as Tom is getting changed before training one day. It has been raining a lot and he knows the pitch will be very muddy. He eagerly anticipates rolling around in the mud as he practices things like tackling and diving with his teammates. DO NOT write flowery, academic prose about social roles and expectations - Tom simply thinks it is great fun getting dirty without batting an eyelid. Alice, a reporter from the local TV news, comes to interview Tom during training. Alice is horrified that Tom “has” to train in such awful conditions, but Tom cheerfully explains that he loves it. Getting muddy is half the fun!","output":"Tom swung open his locker with a grin that spoke volumes about his fondness for the rough-and-tumble game of rugby. Today was no ordinary training day; it had been raining cats and dogs for the past week, and Tom knew that the pitch would be nothing less than a glorious sea of mud, just waiting for him to dive in. As he pulled on his rugby shorts and jersey, his teammates chattered excitedly about the inevitable slips, slides, and glorious mess that awaited them. There was something primal and fantastically freeing about getting covered in mud, and Tom embraced it with open arms — more accurately, with an open and soon-to-be muddied face. He laced up his boots, the anticipation building as he jogged out onto the field. True to his expectations, the pitch was a splatter artist's paradise. Without hesitation, Tom joined in the warm-up, grinning from ear to ear as the first splashes of mud hit his legs. Midway through an enthusiastic rendition of what could only loosely be described as a 'tackle,' Alice, the local TV news reporter, arrived. She stepped carefully along the sidelines, trying to avoid the muddy battlefield that stretched out before her. Her expression was a mix of shock and pity as she watched Tom and his teammates revel in the grime. \\"Can we get an interview?\\" Alice called to Tom, a note of sympathy in her voice as she looked around the sodden field. Tom trotted over with a look of bewilderment, not quite understanding her dismay. As she gingerly held the microphone out to him, being careful not to touch the mud splattered on his jersey, her nose scrunched up slightly. \\"So, Tom,\\" she began, \\"It must be pretty tough having to train in these awful conditions, right?\\" Tom just chuckled heartily, wiping a muck-covered hand across his brow. \\"Awful? This?\\" He gestured expansively to the pitch as another player performed what was probably meant to be a pass but ended up as a mud missile. \\"This is the best part! You haven't really played rugby until you've been caked in mud head-to-toe. It's all part of the fun!\\" Alice's eyes widened as she struggled to comprehend. \\"You mean you actually enjoy this?\\" she asked, clearly baffled. \\"Oh, absolutely!\\" Tom exclaimed, his enthusiasm undimmed by the weather or her reaction. \\"Rugby's not just a game; it's an adventure. And when you add mud to the mix, it becomes a celebration of the sport. What could be better than diving into the thick of it, getting a little dirty, and coming out at the other end with a story to tell?\\" Tom, ever the affable sportsman, patted her cautiously on the shoulder, leaving a smudge of mud as a memento of the interview. \\"Hey, you should join us! There's plenty of mud to go around!\\" Alice smiled, politely declining the offer. \\"I think I'll leave the mud wrestling to the experts,\\" she replied with a laugh. As Tom hopped back into the fray, Alice couldn't help but be infected by his joy. She realized that for Tom and his teammates, this was more than training; it was their way of finding joy in the chaos, of turning rain into playtime. It wasn't about getting dirty; it was about living life to the fullest, one splashy, muddy dive at a time."},{"instruction":"Please change the story so it is about Lucia instead of Tom.","output":"Lucia clicked open her locker with a gleam in her eye that told a tale of her passion for the spirited world of rugby. This particular practice promised to be beyond the realm of the ordinary; relentless rain had rendered the field into what Lucia regarded as a delightful mire, ideal for rugby revelry. Slipping into her rugby kit, her teammates buzzed with live wires of excitement about the upcoming session's sloppy tackles and mud baths. For Lucia, there was a raw and unbridled joy in becoming one with the earth, and she couldn't wait to dive in both figuratively and literally. With her boots tied tight and her heart pounding with eagerness, Lucia pranced out to the pitch. It was just as she dreamed — an expanse of mud that beckoned her to play, to slide, to surrender to the squelch and splatter. During a particularly zealous attempt at a practice drill — where diving into the mud was nearly as important as the ball itself — Alice, the local TV news reporter, approached the field. She picked her steps with care, aiming to dodge the chocolatey quagmire that was enthralling Lucia and her teammates. \\"May we grab a quick word?\\" Alice called over, her inflection colored with empathy as she took in the sight of the muddied rugby players. Lucia jogged over, her bafflement clear as day on her mud-spattered face, failing to grasp Alice's look of concern. As Alice extended the microphone towards her, her hands meticulously avoiding any contact with Lucia's muddy kit, a look of mild disgust crossed her face. \\"Lucia,\\" she began, her voice carrying tones of consolation, \\"training in these tough conditions must be really challenging, isn't it?\\" Laughing heartily, Lucia wiped her mud-smeared hands down her rugby shorts. \\"Challenging? This?\\" She motioned to the mud-laden field, just as a teammate tackled another into a gloriously splattered heap. \\"This is what it’s all about! Rugby isn’t the same without a full coating of mud. It’s what makes it fun!\\" Alice stood there, eyes wide with amazement. \\"You mean you actually enjoy getting this muddy?\\" \\"Of course,\\" Lucia replied with infectious gusto. \\"Rugby isn’t just about the sport; it’s about the thrill, and the mud just amplifies the whole experience. There’s nothing like a good mud dive to make you feel alive, to give you stories to laugh about later!\\" With a cheeky grin, Lucia gave Alice's shoulder a gentle tap, leaving a little smear of the field on her. \\"Come on, join us! There's enough mud for everyone!\\" Alice grinned back, though she waved off the suggestion. \\"I think I'll stick to reporting from the sidelines,\\" she good-naturedly declined. As Lucia returned to the fray, ready to embrace the mess once more, Alice realized there was more to this muddy madness than met the eye. For Lucia and her squad, these were the moments where sport turned into an escapade, where the downpour became an invitation to joy. The real aim wasn’t just to get dirty, it was to seize the day one muddy tackle at a time."},{"instruction":"Please write a detailed technical description for an artist to draw an illustration of Lucia.","output":"Title: Lucia, The Rugby Enthusiast in Her Element Description: This illustration is a detailed character portrayal of Lucia, a female rugby player, captured at the height of her muddy training session. The setting is an outdoor rugby pitch slick with rain and churned to deep mud. Lucia is in the foreground, fully engaged and exuding joy. This is not a static portrait; it is an action shot that should convey her movement and energy. Key Features: 1. Physical Appearance: - Lucia is in her early 20s, fit and athletic in build, with muscular legs and arms that show strength without being overly bulky. - She is of average height with a fierce determination in her eyes. - Her hair is dark, tied back in a practical yet messy ponytail with a few strands defiantly plastered to her forehead and cheeks due to the mud and sweat. - A healthy smear of mud decorates her face, highlighting her beaming smile and the sparkle in her eyes. 2. Rugby Kit: - Lucia is wearing a short-sleeved rugby jersey that is form-fitting but allows for full range of motion. The jersey is mostly covered in mud, turning its original color hard to discern, but patches of team color (possibly a vibrant green or blue) peek through. - Her rugby shorts are dark, perhaps navy blue or black, ending mid-thigh and equally caked in mud especially around the sides and back. - Her knee-high rugby socks started the day white with stripes that echo her jersey color but are now predominantly brown, with bits of grass and mud sticking to them. - Lucia's rugby boots are sturdy and cleated for traction, caked with mud but still distinguishable with laces tightly secured. 3. Pose and Expression: - Lucia's posture is dynamic; she’s caught mid-run, one leg bent at the knee lifting away from a puddle, the other leg extended behind her, poised to propel her forward. - Her arms are in mid-pump, elbows bent, hands clenched into fists that cut through the air as she advances up the field. One of her arms should be partially raised, as if readying to catch or pass a rugby ball. - Her face expresses sheer exhilaration, with a broad, toothy grin and eyes that focus on something outside the frame — perhaps the trajectory of an incoming ball or a fellow player she’s targeting for a tackle. 4. Environment: - The pitch in the background is a war zone of mud pools and skid marks. Suggestive of recent rain, leftover puddles reflect the overcast sky above. - Teammates can be seen in the middle ground engaged in action: running, tackling, and playing with equal vigor. - The mud is not uniform; patches of thicker mud should show texture and depth, indicating where the most action has taken place. 5. Additional Details: - Flecks of mud should be in motion, captured in flying specks around Lucia’s body, suggesting her recent engagement with the ground or other players. - The grass, where visible, is wet, trodden, and trampled, with the sideline barely distinguishable. - Optional: In the far background, a slightly out-of-focus figure with a microphone — the reporter, Alice — may be added, provided it does not distract from Lucia’s prominence in the illustration. Lighting: The light source is diffuse, creating soft shadows due to the overcast sky. The light accents the textures of the mud and the glisten on Lucia’s skin but does not generate harsh contrasts. The artwork should capture the essence of Lucia’s unabashed love for the game and the environment in which she thrives. The focus is on her, the mud, and the motion, encapsulating the spirit of a muddy rugby training session and the joy it brings her."},{"instruction":"Please write a detailed technical description for an artist to draw an illustration of Lucia being interviewed by Alice.","output":"Title: \\"Interview on the Muddy Pitch\\" Description: This illustration captures a unique moment where Lucia, a vibrant and mud-splattered rugby player, is being interviewed by Alice, a prim and clean reporter from the local TV news. The setting is an outdoor rugby pitch that has turned into a muddy battleground after a continuous spell of rain. Both figures are central to the illustration, with a stark contrast between Lucia's mud-caked athletic vigor and Alice's professional, immaculate appearance. This is a still moment that contrasts the chaos of rugby with the order of media. Key Features: 1. Lucia's Appearance: - Lucia is standing confidently but casually, weight shifted onto one leg, showing off the athletic physique of a rugby player in their mid-twenties. - She is grinning broadly, her face is covered in streaks and smudges of mud, yet her eyes sparkle with energy and mirth. - Her dark hair is pulled back into a disheveled ponytail, some muddy strands have escaped and adhere to her forehead and neck. - Lucia's rugby jersey and shorts are both heavily stained with mud, the shorts are mid-thigh in length and the jersey is muddied to the point where the team emblem is just barely visible. - Rugby socks are folded down below the knee and covered in splatters, and her boots are thick with mud. 2. Alice's Appearance: - Alice is fully professional: a reporter in her 30s, with sharp and neat attire. She is wearing a tailored jacket and skirt, possibly in a dark, solid color that stands in contrast to the muddy setting. - She is holding a microphone with a slight look of revulsion on her face, trying her best to maintain composure and professionalism amidst the dirty surroundings. - Her hair is styled in a professional manner, and her makeup is intact and unsmudged. - Alice's shoes are sensible but likely inappropriate for the mud, which she seems to be avoiding stepping in. 3. Positioning and Interaction: - Lucia stands with her body angled towards Alice, hands on her hips, one knee slightly bent, in a relaxed posture that conveys her comfort with the situation. Her head is turned to face Alice while talking. - Alice is on the opposite side, facing Lucia, holding a microphone out towards her with one hand, and a hand-held recording device or notepad in the other, slightly recoiling from the mud, as if trying to avoid contamination. - There is a clear distancing in stance between Alice and Lucia, emphasizing Alice's discomfort and Lucia's ease with the muddy conditions. 4. Background and Environment: - The pitch should be in the background, with Lucia's teammates visible in varying degrees of muddy disarray, some engaging in play or practice drills. - The field is rife with muddy patches, with occasional puddles reflecting the sky, suggesting the recent rain. - The sideline should feature some rugby-related paraphernalia, such as water bottles, training cones, and perhaps a ball, adding to the authenticity of the setting. 5. Expressions and Mood: - Lucia has an open, cheerful expression, her hands on her hips in a stance of being proudly unbothered by the mud. - Alice has an eyebrow slightly raised, lips pressed in a mildly forced smile, looking simultaneously intrigued and wary of the mess. - The body language and facial expressions should play off each other, highlighting Lucia's gleeful abandon contrasted with Alice's constrained unease. 6. Lighting and Atmosphere: - Lighting should mimic an overcast day, with a soft shadow underfoot and a balanced but subdued color palette to reinforce the feel of a damp, cloudy day. - The mood of the scene combines Lucia's joy and enthusiasm with Alice's out-of-place formality, capturing the odd, yet amiable, interaction. This illustration should focus on the dynamic between the characters, the contrast in their attitudes and appearances, and the embodiment of Lucia’s joy for the sport and Alice’s professional dedication in less-than-ideal conditions. The scene is a story in itself, showcasing the spectrum of reactions to the same muddy, challenging day on the rugby field."},{"instruction":"That is good, thank you. However, the descriptions for both illustrations are not very descriptive about the state of Lucia's arms, hands, legs and knees. Can you please provide this additional information?","output":"Certainly, I will enhance the description focusing on Lucia's arms, hands, legs, and knees for both illustrations. Illustration 1: Lucia, The Rugby Enthusiast in Her Element Lucia's Arms and Hands: - Lucia's arms should be muscular and toned, with visible definition, emphasizing her athletic prowess. - Mid-motion, one arm is forward with the forearm lifted up and the fist clenched, ready to catch or fend off an opponent. Her knuckles and the back of this hand are caked with mud as if she had just wiped her brow or pushed herself up from the ground. - The other arm is angled back, elbow bent, and her hand formed into a fist that has sliced through the muddy air, perhaps leaving a trail of mud droplets in its wake. - Visible splatters of mud coat her forearms, while heavier mud strokes are gathered around the wrists and hands from direct contact with the pitch. Lucia's Legs and Knees: - Lucia’s legs are powerful and dynamic, mid-stride. The visible muscles in her calves and thighs speak to her agility and strength. - Her leading leg is bent at the knee with the thigh lifted parallel to the ground, showing off the flex of her quadriceps muscle, clearly visible even through the mud. - Her trailing leg is extended, with calf muscles tense. The back of this leg carries a heavy coating of mud, especially around her hamstring area, due to the splashes and slides common in the game. - Her knees are slightly reddened, a testament to recent contact with the field, and are also smeared thickly with mud. Her exposed knees should accentuate the rough nature of the sport and her enthusiastic participation in it. Illustration 2: Interview on the Muddy Pitch Lucia's Arms and Hands: - Standing upright, Lucia's arms reflect a relaxed but confident posture, with one arm casually akimbo, elbow bent and mud streaked hand resting on her hip, giving off an air of nonchalance. This hand and wrist are enveloped in grime, mirroring her full involvement in the sport. - Her free arm hangs naturally by her side, perhaps with a few flecks of mud decorating the skin. The fingers are slightly curled as if she's expressing her point to Alice, and her nails, though perhaps covered in dirt, show that Lucia is unbothered by the muck. Lucia's Legs and Knees: - Lucia is depicted standing solidly on one leg, which bears the weight of her body. This leg is straight, grounded firmly into the muddy earth, showing the strength in her stance. A few stray splatters dot her exposed shin, while her knee is just a shade darker, sullied by the mud from the pitch. - Her off-leg is relaxed but slightly bent at the knee, ready to move or shift her weight if needed. This knee bears a more spattered and smeared look, indicating it has recently made contact with the muddy ground. - The folds and creases around her knees from her bent leg add to the realistic depiction of her muddy sportswear, emphasizing the textures of the wet and muddied fabric of her shorts. In both illustrations, Lucia's limbs should show the signs of an athlete in their element. Her skin, where visible, may be tinged pink from exertion, with the distinct contrast against the brown of the clinging mud. Her knees, elbows, and any exposed skin should tell the story of her active engagement with the field, supporting the narrative of her love for and immersion in the rugged sport of rugby."},{"instruction":"Please change the descriptions for the illustrations so they refer to Tom instead of Lucia.","output":"Illustration 1: Tom, The Rugby Enthusiast in His Element Tom's Arms and Hands: - Highlight Tom's arms to show well-developed biceps and forearms, a testament to his strength and conditioning from playing rugby. - With one arm forward and flexed, his fist is clenched and raised as if in motion to catch a ball or to signal a teammate. This hand and the visible part of the arm should be muddied, with lines of grime delineating the edges of his muscles. - The other arm is swept back, aiding in his forward motion, with the hand balled into a muddy fist, perhaps tremors of mud flying off due to the speed of his movement. - Mud should be splashed up to his elbows, indicative of his frequent contact with the pitch, and his knuckles are darkened from the muddy ground. Tom's Legs and Knees: - Tom's legs should be captured mid-stride, one leg raised and bent at the knee, primed for the next step. The muscles of his quad and the calf of this leg must be tensed and smeared with thick mud. - The other leg is extended back, toes pointed, and the calf muscle bulging from the push-off, also adorned with layers of mud especially around the back of the thigh, hinting at recent sliding or falling on the field. - Both knees are shall be somewhat redder, roughed up by physical play, and covered with uneven smears of mud, suggesting Tom’s active participation on the muddy ground. Illustration 2: Interview on the Muddy Pitch Tom's Arms and Hands: - In this scene, Tom stands with one hand hooked onto his waist, his arm forming a strong, relaxed angle at the elbow. His hand and fingers are slightly cupped, caked with mud that has even found its way under his nails. - His free arm is at his side, perhaps gesturing in mid-conversation, with a light spray of mud across the forearm. His fingers are parted as if emphasizing a point he's making to Alice, the contrast of clean and dirty suggesting the juxtaposition of their activities. Tom's Legs and Knees: - Tom stands with feet shoulder-width apart, one leg straight and taking most of his weight. The front of this leg's shin has spatterings of mud, while the leg's side shows larger mud patches from side contacts and tackles. - The knee of his weight-bearing leg is more heavily stained, while the bent knee of his other, relaxed leg hints at fresher mud, likely from more recent field play. - The mud on his knees adds depth and texture, implying that even though he's standing still for the interview, the game’s roughness is very much a part of him. In both illustrations, Tom's presence should radiate the power and jubilance of a sportsman in his prime, reveling in the game he loves. His body, smeared with mud, his muscles defined through his actions, and his limbs telling the stories of conquests on the field, should communicate his commitment to rugby. The contrast between his rugged appearance and the typical clean-cut media personality should be striking, further highlighted by the environment they both share in this moment."},{"instruction":"집에 먹을게 없어서 쫒겨난 17살 소년 카일이 집 창고에 쳐박혀있던 녹슨 숏소드를 훔쳐서 모험을 떠나서 성장하는 스토리를 써줘 주인공은 무력하고 빼빼마른 소년인데 막노동을 하면서도 자신을 훈련하는데 휴식시간을 아끼지 않았고 끊임없이 훈련함으로서 초급 모험가로 데뷔하는데 성공하는 스토리를 써줘","output":"카일은 평범한 17살 소년이었다. 어려운 가정 환경 탓에 매일이 생존의 투쟁이었지만, 그는 빼빼 마른 몸매 속에 남다른 꿈과 의지를 감추고 있었다. 아버지가 남긴 고물 같은 숏소드에 그의 꿈이 담겨 있었다. 어느 날, 끼니를 거를 정도로 가정의 형편이 악화되자 그는 결단을 내렸다. 창고에 방치된 녹슨 숏소드를 꺼내들고 혼자서 모험을 떠나기로 한 것이다. 초록 늪지대와 휘몰아치는 모래 폭풍이 있는 난관들을 넘어, 카일은 죽음을 무릅쓰고 모험을 이어갔다. 양손으로 거칠게 무기를 휘두르며 몬스터들과 싸우는 일이 일상이 되었고, 가끔 조각만으로도 가치 있는 보물들을 발견하기도 했다. 그러나 무엇보다 카일에게 중요했던 것은 자신의 실력을 향상시키는 것이었다. 매일같이 꽂힌 돌과 나무들을 녹슨 숏소드로 베어내며 무기 운용에 익숙해지고, 밤새도록 기술들을 연마했다. 잠들지 못한 밤은 많았지만, 그의 눈빛 속에는 점점 더 선명해지는 모험가로서의 자신감이 빛나기 시작했다. 정기적으로 동네의 건설 현장에서 힘든 막노동을 하면서도, 카일은 그의 자각을 잃지 않았다. 드디어 그의 노력은 결실을 맺어, 지역 모험가 길드에 그의 명성이 소문으로 퍼져나갔다. 끊임없는 훈련과 수많은 난관 극복 끝에 드디어 카일은 초급 모험가로 데뷔했다. 길드에 등록한 첫날, 카일은 구겨진 옷가지를 곧게 펴고, 녹이 슬어버린 숏소드를 매만지며 자신감 있게 길드 게시판 앞에 섰다. 그의 눈빛에는 더 이상 두려움 대신 기대와 흥분이 가득 차 있었다. 이제 그는 누구도 흔들 수 없는 강인함을 품은 소년에서 진정한 모험가로 거듭나기 시작한 것이다. \\"카일. 네가 우리 길드의 신인이구나.\\" 길드의 장로 중 한명이 카일의 곁에 다가서며 말했다. \\"이 숏소드는 네 의지와 함께 갈고닦아진 든든한 무기야. 낡았지만 그것이 바로 네가 가진 값진 경험의 증거라네.\\" 카일은 가슴 깊은 곳에서부터 벅찬 감정이 솟구치는 것을 느꼈다. 그는 깊숙이 숨겨져 있던 강인한 미소를 지으며 말했다. \\"감사합니다. 저는 이 숏소드와 함께 더 많은 것을 이루어낼 겁니다. 저의 모험이 이제 막 시작된 거니까요.\\" 그리고 카일은 무거운 발걸음을 옮기며, 이제 막 시작된 그의 모험을 향해 걸음을 내디뎠다. 그에게는 더 큰 세상이 기다리고 있었고, 그의 의지는 그 어떤 난관도 극복할 수 있는 힘이 되어 주었다."},{"instruction":"Was the Republican party in the USA once the more liberal party? If so, when?","output":"Yes, the political ideologies associated with the Republican Party and the Democratic Party in the United States have shifted over time. Specifically, during the 19th century and into the early 20th century, the Republican Party, which was founded in 1854, was indeed considered the more liberal or progressive party on several issues, most notably slavery and civil rights. The Republican Party was established by anti-slavery activists and modernizers, and it rose to prominence with the election of Abraham Lincoln as the first Republican president in 1860. The Republicans during this era were instrumental in leading the efforts to abolish slavery and were associated with the Union side during the Civil War. Following the war, during the Reconstruction era, Republicans supported constitutional amendments and legislation to grant African Americans citizenship and voting rights. The Republican Party was generally seen as the party of the North, and it supported a stronger federal government and more industrial and modern economic policies. Meanwhile, the Democratic Party, especially in the South, was associated with the defense of slavery before the Civil War and with opposition to Reconstruction and civil rights initiatives after the war. Southern Democrats often favored states' rights and the maintenance of the traditional social order, which included segregationist policies and opposition to federal civil rights measures. It wasn't until the 20th century, particularly during the New Deal era of the 1930s and following the Democratic presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, that the Democratic Party began to be seen as the more progressive party on economic issues, advocating for greater government intervention in the economy and the establishment of social welfare programs. The ideological switch became more pronounced in the 1960s with the Civil Rights Movement. The Democratic Party, particularly under President Lyndon B. Johnson, supported major civil rights legislation, such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. These actions led to a realignment of party constituencies, with many conservative Southern Democrats eventually shifting to the Republican Party, a transformation that was encouraged by the Republican's \\"Southern Strategy.\\" By the latter half of the 20th century, the Republican Party had increasingly come to align with conservative positions on a range of social, economic, and national security issues, while the Democratic Party had embraced a more liberal or progressive stance on these issues. This general ideological distribution—Republicans as the more conservative party and Democrats as the more liberal party—has continued into the 21st century, though the definitions of \\"liberal\\" and \\"conservative\\" have continued to evolve and vary over time."},{"instruction":"What is the cause of death of Colonel Paco Román?","output":"Colonel Paco Román was an officer in the Philippine Revolutionary Army during the Philippine-American War.

This battle was significant as it was one of the last stands of the Filipino forces against the advancing American troops. Colonel Paco Román died from wounds he sustained during this encounter. Accounts of the battle suggest that he was shot and killed by American sharpshooters or infantrymen.

The exact details surrounding his death are not well-documented in widely known historical records, but it is generally accepted that he was killed in action, possibly due to gunshots by American forces during the battle. His death occurred in the context of a larger conflict where Filipino forces were increasingly outmatched by the better-armed and more numerous American military."},{"instruction":"언더테일 샌즈와 검성 토르의 목숨을 건 대결을 써줘 소설풍으로","output":"어느 시공을 초월한 차원의 경계선 위에서 두 존재가 마주 섰다. 샌즈, 언더테일 세계의 요괴 중 하나이자, 게으름뱅이 해골이면서도 깊은 힘을 감춘 자. 그리고 검성 토르, 아스가르드의 전사이자 수호자. 강력한 물리적 힘과 번개를 다루는 신들의 왕의 아들. 차원의 틈새에 떠 있는 이 공간은 아무런 색깔도, 형태도 없이 변화무쌍하게 휘감겼다. 그러나 그들의 시선은 오직 서로에게 머물러 있었다. 샌즈의 느긋한 표정이 흥미와 긴장으로 뒤섞였고, 토르의 눈동자는 번개처럼 빛나며 태연한 자신감을 내비쳤다. 이는 양 세계 관객 없는, 오직 두 운명의 존재만이 존재하는 무대였다. 샌즈가 먼저 입을 열었다. \\"휴우, 버라이어티한 광경이야. 아무래도 오늘은 나도 좀 진지해져야 할 듯싶군.\\" 토르는 거대한 해머, 뫼우닐을 굳건히 쥐며 답했다. \\"해골인지라 백골이 될 때까지 싸울 의무가 있는 모양이군.\\" 황량한 무대 위, 검성 토르의 해머가 번개와 함께 천둥소리를 내며 샌즈를 향해 내질렀다. 하지만 샌즈는 윙크하며 그 힘을 빠르게 피했다. 그의 움직임은 텔레포테이션 같은 능력으로 점멸하며, 공간 그 자체를 뛰어넘는 듯 보였다. \\"까불지 말라고, 헤에~\\" 샌즈가 태평하게 말하며 해골의 눈에서 빛나는 숨겨진 힘, 'GASTER BLASTER'를 발사했다. 토르는 그 강력한 에너지 빔을 막기 위해 뫼우닐을 들어올려 방어 자세를 취하자, 강력한 충돌이 이 차원의 경계를 뒤흔들었다. 번개가 에너지 빔과 충돌하는 소음이 공명하며, 그들의 대결이 점점 더 치열해졌다. 검성 토르는 번개와 폭풍을 맞추어 해머로 공격을 가하고, 샌즈는 자신의 능력 'KR'을 활용하여 토르의 이동을 방해하고 그의 기의 흐름을 떨뜨렸다. \\"배짱이 대단하군, 허나 인간과 다르게 느리게 늙는 너와는 시간 싸움을 하지 않아도 될 것 같아.\\" 샌즈의 유머가 무거운 공기 속을 헤집었다. 하지만 그의 말과는 달리 그의 눈은 심각함을 배어냈다. reddit.com/topic 토르는 하늘을 가르며 번개를 자신에게 불러들였다. 천둥의 왕으로서의 위엄이 그의 전신을 감싸며, 맹렬한 힘으로 샌즈를 압도하려 했다. 그의 강한 의지가 충돌의 기세를 갈수록 증폭시켰다. \\"이것이 진정한 신의 힘이다, 해골이여!\\" 하지만 샌즈는 주눅 들지 않았다. 그의 감정이 담긴 한 마디가 공간을 울렸다. \\"바깥 세계의 신이라도, 특별한 힘이 필요한 법이지.\\" 그리고 그 순간, 싸움은 끝나 있었다. 샌즈는 토르를 놀리는 듯한 웃음을 지으며 감춰뒀던 본래의 힘을 폭발시켰다. 그의 능력으로 차원을 자유롭게 넘나들며 토르를 현혹시켰다. 토르는 미묘하게 흔들리는 힘을 느끼고 샌즈의 마지막 기술인 'SPECIAL ATTACK'을 맞이했다. 후후, 차원을 뛰어넘는 싸움이 끝나며, 눈깜짝할 사이에 우주의 무대는 다시 평범한 모습으로 돌아왔다. 두 전사는 서로를 인정하는 눈빛을 교환하고 각자의 세계로 돌아갔다. 그들의 대결은 우주의 기억저편에 남겨졌고, 결국 그들의 용맹함만이 시간을 초월해 전해지게 되었다."},{"instruction":"fn main() { let start = std::time::Instant::now(); let file = PathBuf::from(\\"/home/alejandro/Documents/unam/TOGA_old_versions/x/gtf_files/1k.gtf\\"); let contents = reader(&file).unwrap(); let records = parallel_parse(&contents).unwrap(); // {transcript : (chr, strand, [starts], [ends]))} let mut transcripts: HashMap<String, (String, String, Vec<u32>, Vec<u32>)> = HashMap::new(); records.into_par_iter().for_each(|record| { let (chr, strand, start, end, transcript) = ( record.chr, record.strand, record.start, record.end, record.transcript, ); let entry = transcripts .entry(transcript) .or_insert((chr, strand, Vec::new(), Vec::new())); entry.2.push(start); entry.3.push(end); }); let end = start.elapsed(); println!(\\"Time elapsed: {:?}\\", end); } error[E0596]: cannot borrow \`transcripts\` as mutable, as it is a captured variable in a \`Fn\` closure --> src/main.rs:26:21 | 26 | let entry = transcripts | _____________________^ 27 | | .entry(transcript) | |______________________________^ cannot borrow as mutable could you help me with this?","output":"The issue here is that the \`transcripts\` HashMap is being accessed from within a parallel iterator, which uses multiple threads. The \`for_each\` closure in the parallel iterator requires the captured variables to be thread-safe for shared access. To mutate a shared variable, it needs to be wrapped in a type that provides thread-safe mutable access. In Rust, this is commonly achieved by using \`Mutex\` or \`RwLock\`. To resolve the issue, you should wrap the \`transcripts\` HashMap in a \`Mutex\`. A \`Mutex\` will ensure that only one thread can modify the \`transcripts\` at a time, thus preventing data races. Here's how you can do it: \`\`\`rust use std::collections::HashMap; use std::path::PathBuf; use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex}; use std::time::Instant; use rayon::prelude::*; fn main() { let start = Instant::now(); // ... previous code omitted for brevity ... // Wrap \`transcripts\` in a \`Mutex\` and then in an \`Arc\` to safely share and mutate it across threads let transcripts: Arc<Mutex<HashMap<String, (String, String, Vec<u32>, Vec<u32>)>>> = Arc::new(Mutex::new(HashMap::new())); records.into_par_iter().for_each(|record| { let (chr, strand, start, end, transcript) = ( record.chr, record.strand, record.start, record.end, record.transcript, ); // Lock the mutex to safely access and modify \`transcripts\` let mut transcripts = transcripts.lock().unwrap(); let entry = transcripts .entry(transcript) .or_insert((chr, strand, Vec::new(), Vec::new())); entry.2.push(start); entry.3.push(end); }); // the lock is automatically released here let end = start.elapsed(); println!(\\"Time elapsed: {:?}\\", end); } \`\`\` Note that when working with a \`Mutex\`, you must lock it before accessing the contained data, and the lock is automatically released when the \`MutexGuard\` goes out of scope (typically at the end of the block). Keep in mind that using a \`Mutex\` can reduce parallelism due to lock contention, so it might not provide the best performance depending on the workload. If the order in which the \`transcripts\` are updated doesn't matter, and you're simply aggregating results, you might consider collecting the results in thread-local data structures first and then combining them into the global \`transcripts\` HashMap after the parallel iterator is finished. Please also note that I can't see the implementation of \`reader\` and \`parallel_parse\`, nor the structure of \`record\`, so I'm assuming they work as expected and you have the necessary \`use\` statements for things like \`PathBuf\`, \`HashMap\`, and Rayon's traits. If those functions are related to IO, they should not be included within the parallel iteration as they may not benefit from it and could introduce overhead or race conditions unless they're properly synchronized or designed for concurrent access."},{"instruction":"Is it there any other parallel approach you would take? maybe fold() or reduce()?","output":"Yes, indeed there are better parallel approaches than using a \`Mutex\` within the \`for_each\` when dealing with aggregation of results in parallel computations. Rayon provides combinators like \`fold\`, \`reduce\`, and \`collect\` that can help with efficiently combining results with minimal contention. Here's how you might use \`fold\` with \`reduce\`: - \`fold\` is used to create a local accumulator for each thread. It's a method to perform an operation on elements within its local sequential stream. - \`reduce\` is then used to combine all local accumulators into a single accumulator. Let's create a small example showing how you could apply this: \`\`\`rust use rayon::prelude::*; use std::collections::HashMap; use std::path::PathBuf; use std::sync::{Arc, RwLock}; use std::time::Instant; fn main() { let start = Instant::now(); // ... previous code omitted for brevity ... // Don’t need Arc and Mutex anymore, so using just a regular HashMap. let transcripts: HashMap<String, (String, String, Vec<u32>, Vec<u32>)> = records.into_par_iter() .fold( || HashMap::new(), // Create an empty local HashMap as the accumulator. |mut local_transcripts, record| { let (chr, strand, start, end, transcript) = ( record.chr, record.strand, record.start, record.end, record.transcript, ); // Work with the local accumulator. let entry = local_transcripts .entry(transcript) .or_insert_with(|| (chr.clone(), strand.clone(), Vec::new(), Vec::new())); entry.2.push(start); entry.3.push(end); local_transcripts // Return the updated local accumulator. } ) .reduce( || HashMap::new(), // Create an empty HashMap for the reducing step. |mut combined_transcripts, local_transcripts| { // Merge the local accumulator into the combined one. for (transcript, (chr, strand, starts, ends)) in local_transcripts { let combined_entry = combined_transcripts .entry(transcript) .or_insert_with(|| (chr, strand, Vec::new(), Vec::new())); combined_entry.2.extend(starts); combined_entry.3.extend(ends); } combined_transcripts // Return the combined accumulator. } ); let end = start.elapsed(); println!(\\"Time elapsed: {:?}\\", end); } \`\`\` Briefly, here's what happens: 1. Each thread starts with its own local \`HashMap\`. When processing items in its subsequence, a thread adds records to its local \`HashMap\`. 2. Once threads have finished processing their subsequences, the \`reduce\` function is used to combine all local \`HashMaps\` into a single \`HashMap\`. This reduces the overall contention since most of the work is done in separate local data structures that don't require locking. 3. Finally, you have your \`transcripts\` HashMap, which contains the aggregated results from all threads. This approach should provide better performance than using a \`Mutex\`, as it minimizes the locking overhead and takes full advantage of the multiple cores."},{"instruction":"is it possible to introduce an if statement here?: pub fn parallel_parse<'a>(s: &'a str) -> Result<Vec<GeneModel>> { let records = s .par_lines() .map(|line| GeneModel::parse(line, \\"exon\\")) .collect::<Vec<GeneModel>>(); return Ok(records); } I just want to map lines that do not start with \\"#\\"","output":"Yes, you can introduce a conditional within your parallel iterator to filter out lines that start with \`#\`. To do this, you can use the \`filter\` method before calling \`map\` to ensure that only lines not starting with \`#\` are parsed.

The example assumes that \`.collect::<Vec<_>>()\` will work out properly. If \`GeneModel::parse\` can fail, you might need to handle errors in your \`map\` function by using \`filter_map\` instead or some other error handling strategy to ensure you only collect valid results or properly propagate errors. Also, make sure that your \`GeneModel::parse\` function signature accepts \`&str\` and returns a \`GeneModel\` or is compatible with the way it's being used here.

Assuming \`get_sequence\` is a function you've implemented to fetch a DNA sequence fragment given the chromosome, start, end, and strand, and \`records\` variable is some data structure containing the necessary information to achieve this, here's how you could implement that logic. However, note that the logic within this match block is inherently sequential for each transcript because the DNA sequence needs to be reconstructed in the correct order. Therefore, this part should not be parallelized. I'll give you a rough outline without the parallel part, as adding ordered sequence reconstruction into the parallel part is not quite straightforward and would require a different strategy: \`\`\`rust use std::collections::HashMap; // Assume we have a \`get_sequence\` function defined somewhere. // fn get_sequence(records: &mut Records, chr: &str, start: u32, end: u32, strand: &str) -> Result<Vec<u8>, Error>; // Other required variables and types are assumed to be in scope. // ... // transcripts is the result of the parallel operation shown in previous answers. // This below snippet is a separate sequential part that should process the aggregated results. let mut complete_transcripts: HashMap<String, String> = HashMap::new(); for (transcript_id, (chr, strand, mut starts, mut ends)) in transcripts.iter() { let mut seq = String::new(); match strand.as_str() { \\"+\\" => { starts.sort_unstable(); ends.sort_unstable(); } \\"-\\" => { starts.sort_unstable_by(|a, b| b.cmp(a)); ends.sort_unstable_by(|a, b| b.cmp(a)); } _ => continue, } // Assuming that starts and ends are of the same length and correspond to each other. for (&start, &end) in starts.iter().zip(ends.iter()) { match get_sequence(&mut records, &chr, start, end, &strand) { Ok(part) => { let part_str = String::from_utf8(part) .unwrap_or_else(|_| panic!(\\"Invalid UTF-8 sequence for exon: {}-{}\\", start, end)); seq.push_str(&part_str); }, Err(err) => { // Handle errors as appropriate for your use case. eprintln!(\\"Error getting sequence for exon: {}-{}. Error: {}\\", start, end, err); break; } } } if !seq.is_empty() { // Reverse complement the sequence if the strand is negative. if strand == \\"-\\" { seq = reverse_complement(&seq); } complete_transcripts.insert(transcript_id.clone(), seq); } } // Continue with the rest of your logic here... // \`complete_transcripts\` now contains the reconstructed sequences. // Utility function to compute the reverse complement of a sequence. // Implement this based on your requirements for handling DNA sequences. fn reverse_complement(seq: &str) -> String { // Replace this with actual reverse complement logic. seq.chars().rev().collect() } // ... rest of the code ... \`\`\` This loop goes through each transcript's data, sorts the exons, retrieves the sequence, appends it to the transcript sequence, and possibly performs the reverse complement if needed. The sorting and sequence building are specific to each transcript, and since they depend on a specific sequence order, this is naturally sequential in regards to a single transcript. This code is just a skeleton.

Today, the sky had been particularly generous, drizzling down a shower that promised a practice session straight out of a mudder's paradise. She wriggled into her team jersey, the fabric clinging to her arms like a promise of the scrums to come. \\"Looks like a swamp out there,\\" Tom remarked, catching sight of Lucia's beaming face. He cracked a smile, too, knowing full well that for Lucia, the words \\"swamp\\" and \\"playground\\" were synonymous on days like these. \\"You bet!\\" Lucia chuckled, grabbing her mouthguard and giving it a chomp. \\"Today's the kind of day you wish you could bottle up just to release a handful of mud whenever life gets too clean.\\" As they trotted out to the field, their boots squelched eagerly into the soggy earth, each step making a satisfying splat. The team gathered, ready to embrace the delightful mess of the day. Lucia couldn't resist; she took a running leap and belly-flopped into the mire, emerging with a gleeful squawk and a coat of earthy splendor. The whistle blew, and practice began. Lucia dove into tackles and emerged from rucks looking less like a player and more like a jubilant swamp creature. Each time she went down, she came up with a grin plastered on her face, painting happiness with streaks of mud. And then there was Alice, the reporter, perched on the sideline—her face a picture of dismay at the sloppy chaos before her. Her microphone seemed to shiver at the prospect of entering the fray. As she gingerly approached Lucia and Tom, Alice couldn't hide her shock. \\"You're telling me this is... enjoyable?\\" Alice asked, a note of perplexity lacing her words as she gingerly sidestepped a puddle. Lucia, caked in layers of the field, beamed at the camera. \\"Oh, absolutely!\\" she declared with a joyous laugh that sent flecks of mud onto the camera lens. \\"There's nothing like a good splatter of mud to make you feel alive. It's all part of the game!\\" Tom nodded in agreement, spinning a rugby ball in his muddied hands. \\"Wouldn't have it any other way. The rain just adds to the excitement, gives the ball its own little mind. Makes things unpredictable!\\" Alice couldn't help but smile, perhaps finally seeing the gleeful spark in Lucia's eyes — a spark that only the love of mud and sport could ignite. \\"And to think,\\" Lucia continued, a wide grin etched on her dirt-spattered face, \\"some people pay for spa mud treatments. We get ours for free and have a blast playing the sport we love!\\" The interview wrapped up with laughter and an acceptance of sorts from Alice, who, though still precariously avoiding the splashes, had caught a glimpse of the sheer joy that only a true love for the rugged, muddy side of sports could bring forth. Needless to say, Lucia and her teammates left the field that day with more than a few memories — and plenty of laundry."},{"instruction":"Please adjust the story to reflect that while Lucia and Tom play for the same rugby club, their teams would not share a changing room and they would probably be practicing with members of their own teams, not with each other.","output":"Lucia laced up her rugby boots with an irrepressible grin that lit up her face. She sat on the wooden bench of the women's changing room, the scent of damp earth and anticipation hanging in the air. Today, the heavens had opened up just enough to turn the rugby pitch into a delightful quagmire, perfect for a rollicking good practice. \\"I can hear the mud calling my name!\\" Lucia announced to her teammates, who responded with a chorus of laughter and cheers. They all knew Lucia's fondness for the scruffy side of the sport—the tackles, the dives, and most importantly, the gratuitous amount of mud. As the women's team stormed onto the field, their boots squelched with enthusiasm at the sight of the sloppy terrain. They were warriors of the muck, charging for the love of the game. Across the field, the men's team, led by Tom, was equally ready to embrace the soggy conditions. His laughter carried across the pitch, meeting Lucia's ears as he too splashed through the marshy grounds with a similar gleam in his eye. The two teams trained separately, the women mastering lineouts and the men drilling scrums, but they were united in their joyful acceptance of the mud that clung to their bodies like a second skin. The descending rain seemed to energize them, turning their practice into a celebration of the wilder side of rugby. It was amidst this festival of filth that Alice, the local TV news reporter, arrived—her heels sinking slightly into the softened earth on the sidelines. Dressed neatly and sporting a look of concern, she watched as Lucia surfaced from a particularly spectacular tackle, her face alight with glee despite—or perhaps because of—the muddy splatter that now adorned it. Alice approached Lucia, microphone in hand, a clear note of disbelief in her tone. \\"Doesn't it bother you, training in such dreadful conditions?\\" Lucia, standing with her equally muddied teammates, laughed. \\"Bother us? This is brilliant!\\" she said, gesturing to the muddle of players around her. \\"Getting dirty is all part of the fun. It's rugby; we live for days like this!\\" Meanwhile, in the background, Tom rallied his team with a call-and-response chant, streaks of mud highlighting the determination on their faces. Spotted by Alice, he trotedted over, joining Lucia for the interview. \\"Yeah, this is rugby at its finest,\\" Tom quipped, still catching his breath from the drills. \\"Honestly, we wouldn't want it any other way. The mud makes it real—gritty, challenging, and just plain fun.\\" Alice, while still out of her element, was gradually drawn into the infectious atmosphere. The sight of two teams, entirely at home in their miry playground, sparked a sense of curiosity behind her initial horror. Lucia continued with a laugh, wiping a rogue smudge of dirt from her cheek. \\"Seriously, some people pay good money for mud baths—we get ours for free, with the added thrill of the game!\\" The interview wrapped up with the teams demonstrating a shared passion for their sport that transcended a simple aversion to muck. Even Alice, still meticulously avoiding the muddiest spots, couldn't help but smile at the camaraderie and mirth on display. As both teams eventually trudged off the field, they were not only laden with layers of the earth but also the infectious spirit that drew them all to rugby in the first place."},{"instruction":"Please write detailed technical descriptions for an artist to draw two separate illustrations of Lucia and Tom during training.","output":"Illustration 1: Lucia During Training Scene: The rugby field is a landscape of muddy chaos, churned up by the day's practice. Raindrops speckle the air, emphasizing the wet conditions. Lucia is in the foreground, engaging fiercely in a tackling drill with a teammate. Character Positioning and Expression: Lucia is positioned center-left in the frame, in the process of executing a low and technically precise tackle. Her body is angled forward aggressively, knees bent, and her center of gravity is low to the ground to ensure stability and force in the tackle. Her right shoulder is braced for impact, just about to connect with her teammate's mid-thigh, and her arms are poised to wrap around the legs of her opponent for a clean takedown. Her face is a mask of concentration mixed with exhilaration, her mouth slightly open as she emits a determined cry. Her eyes are focused intently on her target, and her brows are furrowed, signaling the intensity of the moment. Attire and Details: Lucia is clad in her team jersey, which is maroon with a gold emblem on the chest. The jersey is untucked and slightly billowy, indicating movement, with splashes of mud across her torso, shoulders, and arms. Her rugby shorts are darker, almost black from the mud, and her long socks are half pulled down, one hanging more loosely than the other from the ongoing activity. Lucia's hair is tied back into a practical but disheveled ponytail, with strands escaping and sticking to her muddy cheeks. There is noticeable mud on her face as well, especially along her jawline and across her forehead, reinforcing the muddy nature of the practice. Background Characters: Behind Lucia, her teammates are engaged in similar drills, mirroring the theme of muddy enthusiasm. Some are half-standing, half-crouching, in preparation to continue the drill or in the middle of cheering on their teammate. Environment: The rugby pitch itself is an expanse of dark, waterlogged grass, with more brown than green visible. Puddles of varying sizes pepper the field, and the goalposts stand as a backdrop to the action, slightly blurred to emphasize the focus on Lucia. Illustration 2: Tom During Training Scene: Tom is part of a live scrum practice. The illustration captures the moment of engagement where both sets of forwards are about to clash. Character Positioning and Expression: Tom is at the center-right of the frame, in the position of the hooker, the core player in the scrum. His stance is low and powerful, with feet planted firmly in the mud for traction. He's hunkered down, with his back almost parallel to the wet ground due to the crouching scrum position, ready for the \\"engage\\" call. His face is set with steely determination, and he's looking straight ahead at his opponents in the other scrum, their faces blurred to showcase the intense focus on Tom. His jaw is set, and his cheeks are puffed slightly, breathing out controlled breaths in preparation for the oncoming physical confrontation. Attire and Details: Tom is wearing the men's team jersey, complementing Lucia's, with the same color scheme but a slightly different pattern. His jersey clings to his muscular frame, the fabric stretched tight due to the forward-leaning scrum posture. Shorts and long socks are similarly caked in mud, and his scrum cap is strapped snugly on his head, with bits of his hair peeking out. He's wearing scrum gloves, providing better grip, and his legs and forearms are flecked with mud, emphasizing the muddy engagement. His socks are stretched up to the knees, with mud streaking from the shins down to the rugged, worn rugby boots that are digging into the turf. Background Characters: His teammates are in their scrum positions around him, syncing their body stances with Tom, as if they’re a single, well-oiled machine. Their expressions are hidden behind Tom's figure, but their tense and ready postures suggest their shared anticipation. Environment: The background conveys the immediate vicinity of the scrum, slightly zoomed in to focus on the intense physicality of the moment. The ground is rough and muddy, more brown than green, indicating a lot of previous scrum engagement. To the side, a coach can be glimpsed, blurred in the mid-distance, observing the scrum with a clipboard in hand, his clothes speckled with the day's mud. In both illustrations, the artist must convey the sensation of wet, heavy air, and the energy of the action should be palpable to emphasize the enthusiasm and intensity Lucia and Tom bring to their training, regardless of the muck and the rain."},{"instruction":"Please write a detailed technical description for an artist to draw an illustration of Lucia and Tom being interviewed by Alice. Remember to describe the state of their arms, legs, hands and knees as well as their kit, faces and hair.","output":"Illustration Description: Lucia and Tom being interviewed by Alice after Rugby Training Scene: The rugby pitch sidelines serve as the background for this post-training interview scene. The ground is visibly uneven and muddy, bearing the marks of a day's hard practice. A solitary bench lies to one side, dotted with water bottles and a few spare training cones. The field itself shows streaks of churned-up grass and mud, signaling heavy use. The goal posts are visible but faint in the background, giving context to the rugby setting. Characters: Three characters are present in the scene—Lucia and Tom, slightly off-center to the left, and Alice, the interviewer, positioned on the right, facing them. Lucia (left character): Lucia stands with a stance that exudes energy and contentment. Her feet are shoulder-width apart, planted firmly in the mud. Her knees bear the brunt of a day's tackles, covered in a mix of fresh and drying mud, showing various shades of dark earth tones. Her arms are relaxed, but her hands are animated, gesturing slightly as she speaks, conveying her passion for the game—all with a bright smear of mud on her right forearm. Her rugby club kit is splattered with mud; the maroon jersey is no longer pristine, streaked with the day's battle scars. The club emblem is still discernible, albeit framed by a splattering of mud. Her shorts mirror the condition of her jersey, evidently well-worn during the practice. Her socks, half-slid down her calves, reveal grass stains blending with the mud, and her boots are thick with clumps of the field itself. Her face is a picture of satisfaction and mischief. A genuine smile stretches across her lips, a few specks of mud accentuating her cheekbones and forehead. Her eyebrows are raised slightly, expressive as she shares her love for the gritty aspects of rugby. Her hair, once in a tight ponytail, now has loose strands clinging to her face and neck due to sweat and moisture. Tom (right of Lucia): Tom stands with one foot slightly in front of the other, his weight shifted back, showcasing a relaxed poise with a touch of fatigue. His legs are caked with drying mud, especially around the knees, which are slightly bent from the constant exertion during scrum practices. His arms are crossed over his chest, hands visible—his left hand partially covered in mud, and the right hand cleaner, perhaps from wiping sweat from his brow during practice. Dressed in his team's version of the muddy maroon and gold kit, Tom's jersey is just as soiled, with long streaks of mud along the sides and back, testament to his involvement in the scrums. His shorts are almost uniformly brown from the dirt, and his socks are unevenly rolled down, with the right one slipping lower than the left. Tom's face carries a look of friendly agreement with Lucia's sentiments, a half-smile edged with the residue of intense exertion. A bit of mud traces the line of his jaw, and his hair is matted down with dampness, some of it escaping from under his scrum cap, which is now pushed back to rest on his head after the practice. Alice (right character): Alice is pristine in comparison, standing with impeccable posture, avoiding muddy patches with careful placement of her feet. Her right hand holds a microphone towards Lucia and Tom, while her left hand is slightly raised, holding a small notepad or digital recorder. Her attire is professional, sharp, and completely clean—a crisp blazer, possibly in a neutral color to contrast the muddy surroundings, and sensible closed shoes that are just shy of the muddiest ground. Her face betrays a mixture of intrigue and slight aversion to the mud. She maintains a professional demeanor, but her eyes are wide as she takes in the enthusiasm of the players before her. She's caught mid-question, her mouth open in dialogue, a slight furrow in her brow indicating her attempt to understand their muddy joy. Her hair is styled for television—neat and tidy, a stark contrast to the disarray of the rugby players' hair. A few loose tendrils hint at the humidity of the environment, but overall, it's clear she has taken pains to protect her appearance from the elements. In this illustration, the artist must capture the contrast between the clean, orderly appearance of Alice and the joyously disheveled and muddy look of Lucia and Tom, while also highlighting the warm dynamic of the interview exchange. The body language should reflect Lucia's animated explanation, Tom's supportive stance, and Alice's professional curiosity, all framed within the muddy, post-game rugby setting."},{"instruction":"Lucia has recently started playing rugby.

There had been a deluge the night before, and while most people grimaced at the thought of the gloomy weather, Lucia was thrilled. She pulled her rugby jersey over her head, a grin spreading across her face as she anticipated the muck and mud that awaited her on the practice field. Her teammates were equally excited, chuckling and joking as they geared up. \\"Looks like we're going for a swim instead of playing rugby today!\\" one of them quipped as they headed out, their boots squelching on the soggy ground. As she stepped out onto the field, Lucia felt the squish of the earth beneath her feet. She couldn't help but laugh, charging through puddles and sliding across the sodden grass during warmups. Then, out of the corner of her eye, she caught sight of Alice, the reporter from the local TV news, making her way towards the field. Alice's pristine shoes were ill-suited for the terrain, and her steps were ginger, a look of disgust on her face as she dodged the muddiest patches. \\"Oh, you poor things, you actually have to train in these terrible conditions?\\" Alice asked with a grimace as she approached Lucia and Tom. Her gaze darted between the two mud-splattered athletes, clearly hoping for some sympathy or outrage. Lucia shook her head, her laughter bubbling up. \\"Poor? Terrible? Oh no, you've got it all wrong!\\" she said, bits of mud flying off her as she gestured grandly. \\"This is the best part of rugby! You get to tackle, dive, and best of all, you get to do it in a glorious, glorious mud pit like this!\\" Tom nodded enthusiastically beside her, flicking a clod of mud from his arm for emphasis. \\"Yeah, we don't just endure it, we actually love it!

The two ran at each other and with a spectacular clash, both ended up sliding a good few feet in the mud, laughter ringing out as they stood up, covered head to toe in muck. \\"See?\\" Lucia beamed, her face streaked with earthy war paint. \\"Getting muddy is half the fun of rugby. It's a messy sport for those who don't mind getting down and dirty. It's liberating, really. Makes you feel alive!\\" Her infectious enthusiasm left Alice at a loss for words for a moment, then the reporter chuckled, shaking her head in disbelief. \\"Well, I suppose that's one way to look at it. You certainly have passion, I'll give you that!\\" The interview wrapped up shortly after, with Lucia and Tom returning to their drills, and Alice promising to watch a game sometime—albeit with better footwear. As Lucia plowed through the muck once more, she felt the fresh splatter of mud against her skin, and it might as well have been applause for the simple, unadulterated joy of playing rugby her way."},{"instruction":"Please write a detailed technical description for an artist to draw separate illustrations of Lucia and Tom during training.

Her hair is a chestnut brown, kept in a practical yet somewhat messy ponytail due to the intensity of training; a few loose strands are clinging to her forehead, muddied and damp. Her face is marked with the signs of her practice: streaks of mud splattered across her cheeks from tackles and dives, and a bright smile that radiates her enthusiasm for the game, her teeth a striking contrast to the grime on her face. For her training kit, she wears a fitted forest green rugby shirt, the fabric heavy and now soaked through with both rainwater and mud. The shirt is long-sleeved, originally designed to stay tucked during the rigorous activity, but now it hangs loose at the waist. Lucia’s shorts are black, sitting just above the knee, and they are almost unrecognizable under the layers of thick, dark mud that cakes them from her dives and tackles. Her legs are powerful and are coated in a spatter of muck, particularly around the knees, which bear the brunt of her engagement with the field. The mud provides almost a second skin, concealing minor scrapes she’s earned throughout training. Lucia's calf-high rugby socks, once white with two green stripes at the top, are now primarily brown, heavy with the clinging mud. Her boots are solid, designed for the sport with cleats that are caked with mud, distorting their original black color. One boot displays a fresh scratch on its side from a recent ruck. Illustration: Tom Tom is a ruggedly built man in his late twenties, with a stature that speaks volumes about his presence on the rugby field. His hair is short, blonde, and dusted with a layer of dirt. The exertion of his training has caused sweat and mud to mix, creating wet smudges that obscure the integrity of his haircut. Tom’s face is set in a determined expression, with a jawline coated in streaks of mud flung up during play. His blue eyes are sharp and focused, even as droplets of a muddy mix run down from his eyebrows, which are furrowed in concentration. He sports a navy blue rugby jersey, robust and reinforced to withstand the pulls and tugs of the game. The usually vibrant color is now dulled by the brownish water stains and splatters of mud from the constant contact with the ground and his teammates. Tom’s legs betray the intense nature of his training, with his quadriceps and calves etched with lines of dirt gathered during various drills. His navy shorts, which reach mid-thigh, are smeared with the earthy tones of the field, and give a clear indication of the number of times he has been up and down in the mud. His socks, like Lucia’s, were once white, but now they’re turned muddy brown, except for the residue of navy stripes around the shin area. Eventually, they tuck into his sturdy, mud-clumped boots, which are a dark grey with a hint of red outlining near the soles, now mostly obscured due to the thick paste of field mud enveloping them."},{"instruction":"Please write a detailed technical description for an artist to draw an illustration of Lucia and Tom being interviewed by Alice.

Lucia: Lucia stands confidently, a slight lean on one leg suggesting her casual approach to the interview. Her hair is brown, tied back in a practical ponytail, but by now it's partially undone. Stray strands cling to the side of her face, matted with a mixture of sweat and mud. Smudges of earth streak across her cheeks and the bridge of her nose, with a rogue splash of mud just below her left eye, expressing the joy of her vigorous practice. A genuine smile of exuberance shows through the mask of grime. Her rugby shirt is green with some darker green elements, such as a stripe or club logo, which are hard to distinguish under a generous layer of mud and grass stains. The sleeves are stretched and twisted from the physicality of training, and parts of the hem cling to her body, weighted down by the wet mud. Lucia's black shorts are soaked and barely visible under all the muddiness, while her legs show signs of extensive mud splatters, with her knees featuring a thick coating of mud, indicative of many successful tackles or scrums. Her hands are dirty, nails have earth under them, but Lucia seems unbothered by it. Her white socks with green stripes at the top are now a uniform mud color, nearly solid from the accumulation of wet earth. Her once-black boots, now heavy with clumps of mud, contrast strongly against her skin, which is also streaked with dirt. Tom: Tom stands with a good-natured but less exuberant presence than Lucia. His short blonde hair is disheveled and has dirt particles forming a makeshift crown on his head. His expression is of contented focus, and his blue eyes gleam with the joy of the sport. His face bears the marks of the game with muddy lines tracing the contours of his jaw and creating patterns across his forehead. His navy blue rugby jersey looks almost two tones darker where the rain has soaked it, with muddy smears across his broad chest and shoulders, resembling the aftermath of a rugby battle. The fabric stretches tightly across his muscular build, accentuating his athletic physique. Tom's shorts have fared no better, and the navy fabric is almost completely obscured by a thick coating of mud. Tom's legs are spattered with mud, and the front of his thighs and knees are especially covered due to direct contact with the ground. His hands are muddy at the knuckles and fingertips, suggesting he's recently wiped his face or pushed himself back up from the ground. His white socks are no longer distinguishable in color from his muddy boots, which are grey with red accents, now dulled and hidden by the thickness of the mud. Alice: Alice stands to one side, microphone in hand, overly cautious of getting any dirt on her clothes. She wears a tidy, professional ensemble – maybe a fitted blazer and smart trousers in contrasting colors like soft grey and dark blue. She has a small, elegant pair of heels, which are woefully unsuitable for the terrain and potentially have a bit of mud staining their edges despite her best efforts. Alice's hair is styled neatly, perhaps in a smart bob or pinned back to keep it away from her face, showcasing an orderly appearance. Her expression is one of disbelief about the conditions Lucia and Tom find joyful, and she maintains a careful distance to avoid splashes from their muddy gear. A small smudge of mud is present on her cheek, humorously contradicting her pristine image—a result of the active environment. Her face is framed by carefully applied makeup, and her expression is professional but edged with incredulity at the athletes' muddy appearances. She holds a microphone with a small station flag, and while her posture is upright and her attire clean, her eyes convey a mix of horror and fascination at the muddy spectacle before her. Background: The background is a blurred representation of the muddy field, with indistinct figures of other players still practicing, and the occasional splash of water or clumps of mud that have been flicked up into the air. The sky is overcast, indicative of recent rainfall, enhancing the feeling of the damp, muddy conditions that are central to the illustration."},{"instruction":"怎么样有效的控制血糖","output":"有效控制血糖需要一个综合管理策略，主要包括饮食、运动、药物和监测血糖水平等方面。以下是一些有助于控制血糖的方法： 1. **饮食管理**： - 采用低糖、低脂、高纤维的饮食。 - 分次餐，即每日多次少量餐饮，有助于稳定血糖水平。 - 注意碳水化合物的摄入，选择全谷物、高纤维的碳水化合物。 - 减少加工食品和含糖饮料的摄入。 2. **体力活动**： - 定期进行有氧运动，比如步行、游泳或骑自行车等，一般建议每周至少150分钟的中等强度运动。 - 力量训练也很重要，每周至少两次，有助于增强肌肉，提升胰岛素敏感性。 3. **药物治疗**： - 遵循医嘱服用抗糖尿病药物，如胰岛素或口服降糖药。 - 按时服药，并根据血糖水平的变化调整剂量。 4. **监测血糖**： - 定期监测血糖水平。糖尿病患者可能需要使用血糖仪。 - 熟悉正常的血糖范围，并了解当血糖过高或过低时如何应对。 5. **控制体重**： - 保持理想的体重，通过健康的饮食和定期运动来控制体重。 6. **避免不良习惯**： - 戒烟和限制饮酒，这些习惯会影响血糖控制。 7. **管理应激**： - 学习应对压力的方法，因为应激可以导致血糖水平波动。 8. **定期医疗检查**： - 定期进行医疗检查，包括血糖、血压和胆固醇水平的检测，并密切关注任何并发症的迹象。 请记住，每个人的情况都不同，因此必须与医疗专业人员合作，制定个性化的血糖控制计划。跟随医生的建议，并根据医疗指导进行调整，这对于有效控制血糖至关重要。"},{"instruction":"如果把进食的时间控制在八小时内会对血糖有帮助吗","output":"所描述的饮食模式被称为“间歔性禁食”（Intermittent Fasting, IF），其中一个常见的方案是16/8方案，即在16小时的时间里不进食，在剩下的8小时内进食。这种饮食方法已经在一些研究中显示出可能对血糖控制有积极的影响。 间歇性禁食可能对血糖有帮助的几个原因包括： 1. **改善胰岛素敏感性**：有研究表明间歔性禁食可能能提升身体对胰岛素的敏感性，有助于降低血糖水平。 2. **减少体重**：间歔性禁食可能有利于减少体重和体脂肪，这对于改善血糖控制非常重要，尤其是对于2型糖尿病患者。 3. **改变激素水平**：长时间禁食可以影响身体的激素水平，这包括有助于调节血糖的激素如胰岛素和胰高血糖素。 4. **减少炎症**：一些研究表明间歔性禁食能减少炎症，而慢性炎症与胰岛素抵抗有关联。 然而，需要注意的是，间歔性禁食并不适合所有人，尤其是以下人群应谨慎或避免实施： - 孕妇或哺乳期妇女 - 有典型或潜在的饮食失调者 - 患有某些慢性疾病，比如糖尿病患者在不经过医生评估的情况下自行实行可能有风险 此外，实行间歔性禁食的人在进食时，仍应关注所摄入食物的质量，保持均衡的饮食。 在尝试间歔性禁食或任何新的饮食习惯之前，尤其是如果您有任何健康问题，应咨询医生或营养专家。他们可以帮助评估该方法是否适合您，并提供指导，以确保您可以安全并有效地控制血糖。"},{"instruction":"Баллон емкостью 50 л заполнен кислородом при температуре газа 20℃.

Пусть начальное давление кислорода было ( P_1 ), а конечное давление после израсходования части кислорода - ( P_2 = P_1 - 0.2 ) МПа. Количество израсходованного кислорода в молях будет разностью ( n_1 - n_2 ), а масса можно определить умножением этой разности на молярную массу кислорода ( M = 32 ) г/моль или 0.032 кг/моль для перевода в килограммы. Поскольку ( P_1 ) неизвестно, нам необходимо рассмотреть изменение давления в терминах изменения количества молей: [ n_1 - n_2 = frac{P_1V}{RT} - frac{(P_1 - 0.2 times 10^6)V}{RT} ] Так как ( V ), ( R ), и ( T ) не изменяются, они сокращаются, и мы получаем: [ n_1 - n_2 = frac{P_1V - (P_1 - 0.2 times 10^6)V}{RT} ] [ n_1 - n_2 = frac{0.2 times 10^6 cdot V}{RT} ] Подставим значения: [ n_1 - n_2 = frac{0.2 times 10^6 cdot 0.05}{8.3144621 cdot 293.15} ] [ n_1 - n_2 = frac{10^4}{8.3144621 cdot 293.15} ] [ n_1 - n_2 approx frac{10^4}{2439.65} ] [ n_1 - n_2 approx 4.1 text{ моль} ] Теперь, умножим количество молей на молярную массу кислорода, чтобы получить массу: [ m = (n_1 - n_2) cdot M ] [ m approx 4.1 cdot 0.032 text{ кг/моль} ] [ m approx 0.1312 text{ кг} ] Следовательно, масса израсходованного кислорода составляет приблизительно 0.1312 килограмма."},{"instruction":"Traducir los textos siguientes a chino en un tono formal y contexto de documentos legales.","output":"Por supuesto, puedo ayudarte con eso, pero parece que no proporcionaste los textos que necesitas traducir.

В этой игре, Эд участвует в гротескном телешоу, созданном человеком по имени Ханз Шоумастер. Шоу называется \\"Rundead\\", где Эд должен пройти через серию зловещих препятствий и испытаний, чтобы в конце концов встретиться с Беном. СЦЕНАРИЙ КОТОРЫЙ Я НАПИСАЛ ОН УЖАСЕН, ПОЭТОМУ ПРИДЕТСЯ ВСЕ СНАЧАЛО СДЕЛАТЬ Сначала фильм лучше начать в мирное время, а потом после это уже разрушительные здания. Например в фильме Эд был ученым в лаборотории. У нее жена тоже ученная. Они вместе с другими ученными поэксперементировали над крысами, чтобы сделать вечную жизнь, и вечную молодость и им это удалось. Они так обрадовались, начали мечтать о будущем, что за это станут выдающимися, популярными людьми, и заработают очень много денег. Они закрыли лабороторию и все пошли по домам ночью. Позже Эд со своей женной на машине приехали домой. Дети находятся у бабушки на пару дней, а родители развлекаются у дома, смотрят фильм, начинают общаться по поводу достижении будущего. Муж в очках начинает флиртовать, разводить ее, она накоонец-то сдается и они начинают заниматься сексом. Вскоре ночью произошло что то нехорошее, крыса умерла, после этого она превратилась в зомби, и каким то образом смогла сбежать с лаборотории. И крыса начинает заражать людей ночью. Родители в очках очень сильно запатели, издают стоны в кровати. Утром в воскресенье встают, идут на работу и они видят что крыса сбежала, не понимают что произошло. В понедельник в школах, в которых они учаться тоже заразились. Их дети пропали без вести, либо заразились. А бабушка заразилась. Родители посмотрели новость в лаборотории о том что начинается заражения в нашем городе. И они видят на улицах толпы зомби, родители переживают о детях, звонят бабушке, но она не принимает трубку, так как она уже заражена. Жена начинает плакать, муж начинает утешать, но лаборотория была почти полностью перекрыта зомбиями, в итоге зомби пробили дверь лаборотории, начинают заражать включая ее жену. Жена не успела принять вакцину, а его муж принял вакцину после того как укусили. Ему не было выхода как прыгнуть в окну, жена сказала живи или типо того, я всегда тебя любила, после это она пожертвовала собой ради его спасения. Он прыгнул в окно с очень высокого этажа, но он выжил, потому что почти полностью эволюционировал в зомби. Мир узнал о вторжении зомби-апокалипсис, начали всемирные переговоры и решили власти мира скинуть ядерную бомбу в город. Как только Эд узнал об этом в новостях, тут же скрылся очень глубоко под землю. В итоге не только все зомби вымерли, но и все люди проживающем в этом городе. Я очень плохо описал часть сюжета для начала так как это было мое виденье, но попробуйте как то преобразовать получше, так чтобы было более детально и просто. СЦЕНАРИЙ ДОЛЖЕН НАЧАТЬСЯ ВОТ ТАК: Полный сюжет фильма \\"RUN ZOMBIE, RUN\\": Акт 1: Введение в мир и персонажей Открытие фильма: • Фильм начинается в мирное время, в современном научном городе, где жизнь кипит и наука бурлит. • Эд – талантливый учёный, занятый исследованиями в области биотехнологий вместе со своей женой и коллегами. Они стоят на пороге прорыва: создания вакцины для вечной жизни и молодости. • Научный отдел в восторге от открытия, в лаборатории царит атмосфера торжества. После успешной презентации их эксперимента над крысами, Эд и его жена возвращаются домой, чтобы отпраздновать успех. Буря наступает: • Интимные моменты между Эдом и его женой дома. Они обсуждают планы на будущее, их романтическая встреча переходит в страстный вечер. Секс должен быть! • Когда после утро голые с обьятием жены в постели,и через некоторое время начинают звонить в телефон эда и сообщают что в вашем лаборотории что-то случилось не хорошее. • Радость прерывается известием о трагедии: инфицированная крыса умерла и восстала как зомби, сбежав из лаборатории и начав заражение города. • Пока Эд и его жена отдыхают, город погружается в хаос. Зомби-вирус быстро распространяется, затрагивая школы, больницы, улицы. Трагический перелом: • На следующее утро Эд и его жена возвращаются в лабораторию и обнаруживают сбежавшую крысу. Новости сообщают о массовом заражении. • Они пытаются дозвониться до детей и родственников, но безуспешно. Улицы заполнены зомби. Лаборатория осаждена толпой заражённых. • После нападения зомби, Эда укусили, и он принимает экспериментальную вакцину. Он вынужден покинуть свою жену, которая жертвует собой, чтобы спасти его. Ядерный удар: • Эд, полузомби, узнаёт о намерениях властей сбросить на город ядерную бомбу. С помощью своих новых способностей он прячется в подземном бункере. • Бомба стирает город с лица земли, уничтожая всех его обитателей, как живых, так и мёртвых. Акт 2: Развитие сюжета и персонажей Эд выходит на поверхность: • После взрыва Эд, один из немногих выживших, покидает своё убежище. Мир, который он знал, больше не существует. • Он встречает Бена, мальчика-сироту, выжившего в руинах города. Между ними завязывается необычная дружба. Выживание в разрушенном мире: • Эд и Бен ищут припасы и остатки цивилизации, стараясь выжить среди развалин и постоянной угрозы зомби. • По мере их путешествия за руинами, Эд начинает терять остатки своего человечества и борется с внутренними демонами. Акт 3: Кульминация и разрешение конфликта Шоу \\"Rundead\\": • Ханз Шоумастер, выживший продюсер, создаёт телешоу \\"Rundead\\" и похищает Бена, чтобы использовать его в качестве приза для Эда. • Эд, теперь полностью зомби, но сохранивший воспоминания о Бене, проходит через жестокие испытания шоу. Финальная битва и трагедия: • Эд освобождает Бена, но внезапно теряет остатки человечности и атакует его, не в силах сопротивляться своему зомби-инстинкту. • Бен превращается в зомби, и они уходят вместе, оставляя мир во власти хаоса и зомби-апокалипсиса. Заключение: • Фильм заканчивается на тёмной ноте. Эд и Бен, теперь оба зомби, сидят на разрушенном мосту, смотря на новый мир, который никогда не будет таким, каким был когда-то. Мария - Жена Эда (учёная) Фильм \\"RUN ZOMBIE, RUN\\" показывает темную сторону человеческой изобретательности и последствия игры с природой. Со смешанными чувствами ужаса и сочувствия зрители следят за путешествием Эда от великого открытия до конечного падения в бездну живых мертвецов. Саундтреки будут браться из оригинальной игры BEN AND ED (2015 года) Дополнительные саундтреки: 1. Песня Yota - The Runner, финальная сцена, где зомби ED будет бежать c предпринимателем HANZ SHOWMASTER который создал величайшее в мире шоу и будут преодолевать препятствии. Зомби ЭД столкнет HANZ SHOWMASTER c площадки и он умирает 2. Песня The Cranberries - Zombie, сцена, где весь механизм вышел из под контроля, испытания стали чрезвычайно сложными, и люди которые смотрят это шоу начинают убегать от атаков зомби. Время продолжает заканчиваться и платформа в очень скором времени падает в лаву. Зомби ED берет в себя в руки и начинает быстро преодолевать все препятствия под эту песню за одну минуту, пока время полностью не истекало. Последние секунды заканчивается и платформа начинает падать в лаву. ED перепрыгивает из платформы и ухватывается руками на землю. А дальше он старается подняться из земли, чтобы не упасть в раскаленную лаву.

Тихая и пустая лаборатория внезапно оживает тревожными звуками сигнализации. Камеры безопасности зафиксировали странные движения – крыса мертва, но её клетка пуста. Мы видим, как темная фигура проникает в здание, заражая первых ничего не подозревающих охранников. 21 СТРАНИЦА ИЗ 150 СТРАНИЦ СЦЕНАРИЯ Начало сценария: RUN ZOMBIE, RUN an origin written by Alan Volker SHOOTING SCRIPT PAGE 1 OF 150: FADE IN: EXT. SCIENCE CITY - DAY The camera glides through a bustling metropolis, an eco-utopia where gleaming towers are crowned with verdant gardens and peppered with shimmering solar panels. Skyscrapers stretch toward an endlessly blue sky, and the streets teem with a vibrant mix of researchers in lab coats and students with backpacks slung over their shoulders. Electric buses glide silently past, punctuating the city with a hum of progressive serenity. Digital billboards cycle through breakthroughs in genetic therapy, nanotech, and A.I. We catch glimpses of headlines like “Age Reversal: Myth to Reality?” and “Mind over Matter: Telekinesis Breakthrough!” The camera zooms in on one building in particular: The GENEsis Laboratory, a hub of innovation where the most brilliant minds converge. CUT TO: INT. GENEsis LABORATORY - DAY A swath of excited chatter washes over the open-concept lab floor as a GROUP OF SCIENTISTS gathers around a high-tech enclosure. Inside, a white rat scampers on a wheel, its fur glistening under the lab lights. At the heart of the group, ED (30s), clean-cut and eyes sparkling with enthusiasm, discusses animatedly with his team. He gestures towards the rat and the complex array of equipment monitoring its vitals. A sense of imminent victory electrifies the air. ED (to his fellow scientists) We’re on the brink, people! This little guy is living proof. The answer to mortality, it’s here, within our grasp. A few feet away, Ed’s wife, MARIA (30s), equally brilliant and poised, smiles at Ed’s passion. She exchanges a knowing look with a well-dressed INVESTOR, silently communicating: “We’ve done it.” CUT TO: EXT. SCIENCE CITY - SUNSET The sun sets, casting a golden hue over the city, painting the labs and bustling streets in a warm light. The workday draws to a close, but a new chapter for humanity is about to begin. The RAUCOUS CHEERS from the lab fade into the evening as people start to leave the GENEsis building, their faces glowing with both fatigue and fulfillment. Ed and Maria, hand in hand, step out into the evening air, anticipation for the night ahead bright in their eyes. As they walk away, the CAMERA stays, lingering on the GENEsis building where behind closed doors, the seed of chaos unknowingly sows its roots. CUT TO: INT. ED AND MARIA’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT The setup is romantic. Dim lights, soft music, clinking glasses. They toast to their future, laughing and entwined on the couch. MARIA (nuzzling against Ed) To our breakthrough. To us. ED And to the world that’s about to change. They kiss, deeply, the world outside forgotten. As the embrace intensifies, the camera pans away discreetly, their murmurs and laughter fading into the sounds of the nightlife outside. FADE OUT. END OF PAGE 1 OF 150 PAGE 2 OF 150: INT. GENEsis LABORATORY - DAY The camera finds ED, mid-30s, a scientist with the focused eyes of a man who lives for his work. He’s standing in a state-of-the-art lab, surrounded by the hum of machinery and the sterile scent of progress. Test tubes bubble, machines whir, and screens display complex genetic sequences. Ed is the eye of the scientific storm, calm and deeply immersed in his research. A large white rat lies sedated on a lab table, connected to an array of sensors. Ed peers into a microscope, carefully adjusts a dial, and nods with satisfaction. MARIA, Ed’s wife, is at a nearby workstation surrounded by monitors showing the rat’s vitals and other statistics. She’s as engaged as Ed, her expression a mixture of concentration and pride. MARIA (to Ed) Heart rate steady, brain activity normal. She’s ready. Ed turns his attention to a SYRINGE filled with a luminous liquid— their latest concoction promising life everlasting. ED This is it, the culmination of our life’s work. Ed injects the serum into the rat. Everyone holds their breath. A tense moment passes, and then— The rat’s eyes flash open. Its vitals surge on the screens. Suddenly, spontaneous applause breaks out. The team exchanges looks of disbelief and joy. Ed and Maria share a moment of triumph. ED (over the applause, to Maria) We’ve made history today. Maria beams, a tear of joy in her eye. CUT TO: INT. ED AND MARIA’S CAR - NIGHT Driving home, the city lights twinkle through the window, reflecting the sparkle in Maria’s eyes. Ed’s at the wheel, quiet but visibly elated. MARIA (squeezing Ed’s hand) Can you imagine? Disease, aging, death— things of the past. Ed looks at Maria, his smile says it all. They are the pioneers of a new frontier. ED And to think, it all started with one little rat. They share a look of excitement and anticipation, not knowing that their breakthrough is about to spark a catastrophe beyond their wildest nightmares. CUT TO: EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT As Ed and Maria drive home, the city is vibrant, alive. But there’s an undercurrent of tension as sirens are heard in the distance. Something unsettling is in the air. Pulling into their driveway, they are unaware that the world they know is about to be thrown into terrifying chaos. FADE TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 2 OF 150 PAGE 3 OF 150: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY The opulent conference room is abuzz with the electric hum of anticipation. Academic elites, top scientists, and influential backers fill the ornate space. Everyone’s attention is riveted on the podium at the front, where Ed stands confidently beside a covered enclosure. ED (sweeping his arms wide) I present to you the future— a triumph over death itself. With a flourish, Ed pulls back the drape to reveal a glass habitat inside which a vivacious white rat scurries about playfully. The audience erupts into a thunderous standing ovation. Flashbulbs pop and the room is awash with applause. At the back, Maria, Ed’s intellectual and emotional partner, beams with pride. Her eyes shimmer with an amalgam of love, respect, and shared dreams. She claps with genuine admiration. ED (raising his voice to be heard over the clamor) This is merely the beginning. Today we celebrate not the end, but the dawn of a new era in biotechnology. One where eternal youth is not just a fantasy. The clamor grows louder as reporters clamor for comments, their questions flying fast and furious. Ed, the paragon of composure, engages with the media with the ease of someone who has done this many times before. MARIA (hugging a fellow scientist) We did it, we really did it! The fellow scientist nods, equally excited. Ed’s gaze finds Maria’s across the room, and their shared look is electric. They know their lives will never be the same. CUT TO: EXT. GENEsis LABORATORY - DUSK The building that was once a beacon of hope now looks menacing as the shadows of dusk gather around it. Inside, something nefarious has been unleashed, unbeknownst to the joyous crowd departing the laboratory grounds. As the last of the daylight fades, a frightening new chapter in humanity’s history is about to be written in blood and darkness. FADE OUT. END OF PAGE 3 OF 150 PAGE 4 OF 150: INT. ED AND MARIA’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT The ambiance is cozy and warm as Ed and Maria step into the sanctuary of their home. Soft jazz fills the background, a stark contrast to the scientific sterility of the lab. They are enveloped by a euphoria that goes beyond the walls of professional achievement; this is deeply personal. As they unwind, Maria flips through a plethora of congratulatory messages from colleagues across the globe; her eyes sparkle with tears of joy. Ed pours two glasses of champagne, the bubbly mirroring the effervescence of the moment. MARIA (overwhelmed with emotion) To think, it’s not just about us… it’s about what this means for humanity. Ed raises his glass, acknowledging the weight of their work. ED (raises his glass) To a future forged by our hands. They clink glasses and sip the liquid celebration, sinking into the comfort of their shared labors.

REPORTER Could this technology lead to overpopulation, if we’re all living longer—or even forever? Maria steps forward, her tone measured and reassuring. MARIA That’s a valid concern, and we’re working closely with global leaders in demography and sustainability. We’re advocates for a measured, phased approach to the introduction of this therapy. The questions come more rapidly now, from bioethicists, futurists, and the press. Each answer is more thoughtful than the last, portraying a team prepared for the depth of their discovery. A distinguished PROFESSOR clears his throat, attention focusing on him. PROFESSOR You’ve talked about the potential for this to fight disease, but is there a risk it could be weaponized or monopolized? ED (transparency in his voice) We’re acutely aware of that risk. Therefore, we’ve involved international health organizations from the onset to ensure equitable access. As for the former, stringent security protocols are in place to safeguard our work from unethical use. The power to extend life carries the responsibility to protect it. The question and answer session rolls on, punctuated by flashes from camera bulbs and scribbling pencils. As they continue to field inquiries, the depths of their commitment to this technology’s proper stewarding stand out against the backdrop of potential and peril. FADE OUT.

BACK TO MARIA AND ED As the storm outside their window rages, a different tempest looms. Ed stands, determination etching his features. He’s no longer just a man but a guardian against the consequences of their hubris. ED (settling into crisis mode) I have to fix this. We have to contain it—before it’s too late. With the storm as their herald, Ed and Maria brace for the dawn of an uncertain future cast under the shadow of their own creation. The screen fades to black, leaving behind an ominous silence. FADE OUT. END OF PAGE 19 OF 150 [Note: The following pages build upon the tense atmosphere, exploring the outbreak’s initial spread through Ed and Maria’s experience, setting the stage for the chaos to engulf the narrative and their city’s fate.] Please note that, based on your instruction, the narrative detail and specificity may require adjustments to adhere to production realities, audience sensitivities, and the film’s emotional intent.

ED AND MARIA’S BEDROOM – VERY EARLY MORNING The blue hue of predawn light filters through the window. ED (30s), more harried than before, is already dressed, his eyes glued to a series of charts and data on his laptop. MARIA (early 30s), equally somber, is on the phone, her voice a mixture of urgency and control. MARIA (into phone) No! Listen to me… isolate the afflicted areas, set up quarantine zones, and get the National Guard on standby. Ed watches her, admiration and worry battling within him as she steps up to the unfolding crisis. CUT TO: INT. GENEsis LABORATORY - CONTAINMENT FACILITY - SAME TIME Monitors show scientists in hazmat suits moving frantically. They examine petri dishes and run tests at breakneck speed, while a LARGE DIGITAL CLOCK counts down, adding to the tension. One young SCIENTIST, pale but determined, shares her findings with the head of the team - another piece of the deadly puzzle they are racing to solve. YOUNG SCIENTIST (almost breathless) The mutation rate is off the charts. It’s adapting faster than we can track. HEAD SCIENTIST (grave) Keep testing. We need a breakthrough, and fast. CUT TO: EXT. SCIENCE CITY - DAWN The once bustling city streets are now hauntingly silent. A lone DOG trots across an intersection, stopping to sniff at an overturned trash can. The eerie quiet betrays the panic that has gripped the city. CUT TO: INT. ED AND MARIA’S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS Ed hangs up his phone, the finality in his voice echoing in the tense atmosphere. ED (to Maria) We go back to the lab. We created this… Whatever it takes, we end it. Maria nods, her face set with resolve, as they both grab their pre-packed emergency bags. MARIA (steeling herself) Let’s do this. For our city, our kids… for a future. They share a quick but intense look of solidarity before moving towards the door. CUT TO: INT. GENEsis LABORATORY - SECURITY CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER Ed swipes his ID card with a trembling hand. The doors hiss open, revealing the chaos within. He braces himself for the sight, steeling his nerve for the tasks ahead. Maria follows, her scientific mind switching to high gear, pushing the fear to the back as they step into the unknown. CUT TO: Technical blueprints, epidemiological charts, and disaster management plans are strewn across the command center table. The screen splits to show government and military officials in conference - the fate of the city hangs in the balance. CUT TO: ED AND MARIA, now geared up in protective suits, face each other in the dim light of the lab. ED (voice muffled through mask) No matter what happens, know that I’ve never been prouder to be at your side. MARIA (tearfully resolute) Together. Always. They lock eyes as the lab door seals behind them, the silence of the chamber amplifying the gravity of each step forward. FADE OUT. END OF PAGE 20 OF 150 This is a continuation in the style you began, staying true to the tone and pacing you’ve set. Remember that in actual screenwriting, there is standard formatting to adhere to, and input from subject matter experts could be invaluable in crafting both the story’s scientific elements and dramatic tension.","output":"Scene 21: Nocturnal Resurgence (1 page) INT. GENEsis LABORATORY - NIGHT The quiet and deserted laboratory is suddenly pierced by the startling blare of an alarm. Security cameras capture disturbing movements— the \\"deceased\\" test rat is now conspicuously absent from its previously inescapable enclosure. A dark figure is seen infiltrating the facility, spreading infection to the unsuspecting night-shift guards with a feral ferocity.

GENEsis LABORATORY - SECURITY HUB - CONTINUOUS Alone in the pulsating red glow, the night-shift SECURITY GUARD jolts to attention as monitors blip with urgent warnings. He scrambles to assess the breach, cold sweat beading on his forehead. SECURITY GUARD (mumbling to himself) This is way above my pay grade... On the screen, we see grainy footage of the lab's interior. A body lies motionless on the floor—a second guard attacked just seconds ago. CUT TO: INT. GENEsis LABORATORY - HIGH-SECURITY CONTAINMENT - SAME The rat’s cage door swings open eerily. The once lifeless subject now displaying an unnatural vigor, its fur stiff with dried blood, clawing its way out into the open lab, eerily sentient. From a dark corner, the flashing alarm light catches the glossy eyes of a RODENT, once a docile test subject, now a harbinger of death. A stiff guard lies by the shattered enclosure, his radio crackles with a voice frantically trying to reach him—never to be answered. CUT TO: INT. SCIENCE CITY STREETS - CONTINUOUS As the city sleeps, the threat multiplies in the shadows. An infected rat stealthily navigates the labyrinth of alleys and sewer grates, a single vector of an impending epidemic. CUT TO: INT. GENEsis LABORATORY - VENTILATION SHAFTS - CONTINUOUS Through the metallic veins of the building, the creature slithers, propelled by a hunger no longer governed by the simplicity of nature. It moves with unholy purpose towards the world outside. CUT TO: INT. ED AND MARIA’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER The couple sleeps, oblivious to the chaos brewing. They are the serene eye of an unknowingly escalating storm. EXT. SCIENCE CITY - DAWN The first rays of dawn cast an otherworldly hue over the city.

В этой игре, Эд участвует в гротескном телешоу, созданном человеком по имени Ханз Шоумастер. Шоу называется \\"Rundead\\", где Эд должен пройти через серию зловещих препятствий и испытаний, чтобы в конце концов встретиться с Беном. СЦЕНАРИЙ КОТОРЫЙ Я НАПИСАЛ ОН УЖАСЕН, ПОЭТОМУ ПРИДЕТСЯ ВСЕ СНАЧАЛО СДЕЛАТЬ Сначала фильм лучше начать в мирное время, а потом после это уже разрушительные здания. Например в фильме Эд был ученым в лаборотории. У нее жена тоже ученная. Они вместе с другими ученными поэксперементировали над крысами, чтобы сделать вечную жизнь, и вечную молодость и им это удалось. Они так обрадовались, начали мечтать о будущем, что за это станут выдающимися, популярными людьми, и заработают очень много денег. Они закрыли лабороторию и все пошли по домам ночью. Позже Эд со своей женной на машине приехали домой. Дети находятся у бабушки на пару дней, а родители развлекаются у дома, смотрят фильм, начинают общаться по поводу достижении будущего. Муж в очках начинает флиртовать, разводить ее, она накоонец-то сдается и они начинают заниматься сексом. Вскоре ночью произошло что то нехорошее, крыса умерла, после этого она превратилась в зомби, и каким то образом смогла сбежать с лаборотории. И крыса начинает заражать людей ночью. Родители в очках очень сильно запатели, издают стоны в кровати. Утром в воскресенье встают, идут на работу и они видят что крыса сбежала, не понимают что произошло. В понедельник в школах, в которых они учаться тоже заразились. Их дети пропали без вести, либо заразились. А бабушка заразилась. Родители посмотрели новость в лаборотории о том что начинается заражения в нашем городе. И они видят на улицах толпы зомби, родители переживают о детях, звонят бабушке, но она не принимает трубку, так как она уже заражена. Жена начинает плакать, муж начинает утешать, но лаборотория была почти полностью перекрыта зомбиями, в итоге зомби пробили дверь лаборотории, начинают заражать включая ее жену. Жена не успела принять вакцину, а его муж принял вакцину после того как укусили. Ему не было выхода как прыгнуть в окну, жена сказала живи или типо того, я всегда тебя любила, после это она пожертвовала собой ради его спасения. Он прыгнул в окно с очень высокого этажа, но он выжил, потому что почти полностью эволюционировал в зомби. Мир узнал о вторжении зомби-апокалипсис, начали всемирные переговоры и решили власти мира скинуть ядерную бомбу в город. Как только Эд узнал об этом в новостях, тут же скрылся очень глубоко под землю. В итоге не только все зомби вымерли, но и все люди проживающем в этом городе. Я очень плохо описал часть сюжета для начала так как это было мое виденье, но попробуйте как то преобразовать получше, так чтобы было более детально и просто. СЦЕНАРИЙ ДОЛЖЕН НАЧАТЬСЯ ВОТ ТАК: Полный сюжет фильма \\"RUN ZOMBIE, RUN\\": Акт 1: Введение в мир и персонажей Открытие фильма: • Фильм начинается в мирное время, в современном научном городе, где жизнь кипит и наука бурлит. • Эд – талантливый учёный, занятый исследованиями в области биотехнологий вместе со своей женой и коллегами. Они стоят на пороге прорыва: создания вакцины для вечной жизни и молодости. • Научный отдел в восторге от открытия, в лаборатории царит атмосфера торжества. После успешной презентации их эксперимента над крысами, Эд и его жена возвращаются домой, чтобы отпраздновать успех. Буря наступает: • Интимные моменты между Эдом и его женой дома. Они обсуждают планы на будущее, их романтическая встреча переходит в страстный вечер. Секс должен быть! • Когда после утро голые с обьятием жены в постели,и через некоторое время начинают звонить в телефон эда и сообщают что в вашем лаборотории что-то случилось не хорошее. • Радость прерывается известием о трагедии: инфицированная крыса умерла и восстала как зомби, сбежав из лаборатории и начав заражение города. • Пока Эд и его жена отдыхают, город погружается в хаос. Зомби-вирус быстро распространяется, затрагивая школы, больницы, улицы. Трагический перелом: • На следующее утро Эд и его жена возвращаются в лабораторию и обнаруживают сбежавшую крысу. Новости сообщают о массовом заражении. • Они пытаются дозвониться до детей и родственников, но безуспешно. Улицы заполнены зомби. Лаборатория осаждена толпой заражённых. • После нападения зомби, Эда укусили, и он принимает экспериментальную вакцину. Он вынужден покинуть свою жену, которая жертвует собой, чтобы спасти его. Ядерный удар: • Эд, полузомби, узнаёт о намерениях властей сбросить на город ядерную бомбу. С помощью своих новых способностей он прячется в подземном бункере. • Бомба стирает город с лица земли, уничтожая всех его обитателей, как живых, так и мёртвых. Акт 2: Развитие сюжета и персонажей Эд выходит на поверхность: • После взрыва Эд, один из немногих выживших, покидает своё убежище. Мир, который он знал, больше не существует. • Он встречает Бена, мальчика-сироту, выжившего в руинах города. Между ними завязывается необычная дружба. Выживание в разрушенном мире: • Эд и Бен ищут припасы и остатки цивилизации, стараясь выжить среди развалин и постоянной угрозы зомби. • По мере их путешествия за руинами, Эд начинает терять остатки своего человечества и борется с внутренними демонами. Акт 3: Кульминация и разрешение конфликта Шоу \\"Rundead\\": • Ханз Шоумастер, выживший продюсер, создаёт телешоу \\"Rundead\\" и похищает Бена, чтобы использовать его в качестве приза для Эда. • Эд, теперь полностью зомби, но сохранивший воспоминания о Бене, проходит через жестокие испытания шоу. Финальная битва и трагедия: • Эд освобождает Бена, но внезапно теряет остатки человечности и атакует его, не в силах сопротивляться своему зомби-инстинкту. • Бен превращается в зомби, и они уходят вместе, оставляя мир во власти хаоса и зомби-апокалипсиса. Заключение: • Фильм заканчивается на тёмной ноте. Эд и Бен, теперь оба зомби, сидят на разрушенном мосту, смотря на новый мир, который никогда не будет таким, каким был когда-то. Мария - Жена Эда (учёная) Фильм \\"RUN ZOMBIE, RUN\\" показывает темную сторону человеческой изобретательности и последствия игры с природой. Со смешанными чувствами ужаса и сочувствия зрители следят за путешествием Эда от великого открытия до конечного падения в бездну живых мертвецов. Саундтреки будут браться из оригинальной игры BEN AND ED (2015 года) Дополнительные саундтреки: 1. Песня Yota - The Runner, финальная сцена, где зомби ED будет бежать c предпринимателем HANZ SHOWMASTER который создал величайшее в мире шоу и будут преодолевать препятствии. Зомби ЭД столкнет HANZ SHOWMASTER c площадки и он умирает 2. Песня The Cranberries - Zombie, сцена, где весь механизм вышел из под контроля, испытания стали чрезвычайно сложными, и люди которые смотрят это шоу начинают убегать от атаков зомби. Время продолжает заканчиваться и платформа в очень скором времени падает в лаву. Зомби ED берет в себя в руки и начинает быстро преодолевать все препятствия под эту песню за одну минуту, пока время полностью не истекало. Последние секунды заканчивается и платформа начинает падать в лаву. ED перепрыгивает из платформы и ухватывается руками на землю. А дальше он старается подняться из земли, чтобы не упасть в раскаленную лаву.

He gestures towards the rat and the complex array of equipment monitoring its vitals. A sense of imminent victory electrifies the air. ED (to his fellow scientists) We’re on the brink, people! This little guy is living proof. The answer to mortality, it’s here, within our grasp. A few feet away, Ed’s wife, MARIA (30s), equally brilliant and poised, smiles at Ed’s passion. She exchanges a knowing look with a well-dressed INVESTOR, silently communicating: “We’ve done it.” CUT TO: EXT. SCIENCE CITY - SUNSET The sun sets, casting a golden hue over the city, painting the labs and bustling streets in a warm light. The workday draws to a close, but a new chapter for humanity is about to begin. The RAUCOUS CHEERS from the lab fade into the evening as people start to leave the GENEsis building, their faces glowing with both fatigue and fulfillment. Ed and Maria, hand in hand, step out into the evening air, anticipation for the night ahead bright in their eyes. As they walk away, the CAMERA stays, lingering on the GENEsis building where behind closed doors, the seed of chaos unknowingly sows its roots. CUT TO: INT. ED AND MARIA’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT The setup is romantic. Dim lights, soft music, clinking glasses. They toast to their future, laughing and entwined on the couch. MARIA (nuzzling against Ed) To our breakthrough. To us. ED And to the world that’s about to change. They kiss, deeply, the world outside forgotten. As the embrace intensifies, the camera pans away discreetly, their murmurs and laughter fading into the sounds of the nightlife outside. FADE OUT. END OF PAGE 1 OF 150 PAGE 2 OF 150: INT. GENEsis LABORATORY - DAY The camera finds ED, mid-30s, a scientist with the focused eyes of a man who lives for his work. He’s standing in a state-of-the-art lab, surrounded by the hum of machinery and the sterile scent of progress. Test tubes bubble, machines whir, and screens display complex genetic sequences. Ed is the eye of the scientific storm, calm and deeply immersed in his research. A large white rat lies sedated on a lab table, connected to an array of sensors. Ed peers into a microscope, carefully adjusts a dial, and nods with satisfaction. MARIA, Ed’s wife, is at a nearby workstation surrounded by monitors showing the rat’s vitals and other statistics. She’s as engaged as Ed, her expression a mixture of concentration and pride. MARIA (to Ed) Heart rate steady, brain activity normal. She’s ready. Ed turns his attention to a SYRINGE filled with a luminous liquid— their latest concoction promising life everlasting. ED This is it, the culmination of our life’s work. Ed injects the serum into the rat. Everyone holds their breath. A tense moment passes, and then— The rat’s eyes flash open. Its vitals surge on the screens. Suddenly, spontaneous applause breaks out. The team exchanges looks of disbelief and joy. Ed and Maria share a moment of triumph. ED (over the applause, to Maria) We’ve made history today. Maria beams, a tear of joy in her eye. CUT TO: INT. ED AND MARIA’S CAR - NIGHT Driving home, the city lights twinkle through the window, reflecting the sparkle in Maria’s eyes. Ed’s at the wheel, quiet but visibly elated. MARIA (squeezing Ed’s hand) Can you imagine? Disease, aging, death— things of the past. Ed looks at Maria, his smile says it all. They are the pioneers of a new frontier. ED And to think, it all started with one little rat. They share a look of excitement and anticipation, not knowing that their breakthrough is about to spark a catastrophe beyond their wildest nightmares. CUT TO: EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT As Ed and Maria drive home, the city is vibrant, alive. But there’s an undercurrent of tension as sirens are heard in the distance. Something unsettling is in the air. Pulling into their driveway, they are unaware that the world they know is about to be thrown into terrifying chaos. FADE TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 2 OF 150 PAGE 3 OF 150: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY The opulent conference room is abuzz with the electric hum of anticipation. Academic elites, top scientists, and influential backers fill the ornate space. Everyone’s attention is riveted on the podium at the front, where Ed stands confidently beside a covered enclosure. ED (sweeping his arms wide) I present to you the future— a triumph over death itself. With a flourish, Ed pulls back the drape to reveal a glass habitat inside which a vivacious white rat scurries about playfully. The audience erupts into a thunderous standing ovation. Flashbulbs pop and the room is awash with applause. At the back, Maria, Ed’s intellectual and emotional partner, beams with pride. Her eyes shimmer with an amalgam of love, respect, and shared dreams. She claps with genuine admiration. ED (raising his voice to be heard over the clamor) This is merely the beginning. Today we celebrate not the end, but the dawn of a new era in biotechnology. One where eternal youth is not just a fantasy. The clamor grows louder as reporters clamor for comments, their questions flying fast and furious. Ed, the paragon of composure, engages with the media with the ease of someone who has done this many times before. MARIA (hugging a fellow scientist) We did it, we really did it! The fellow scientist nods, equally excited. Ed’s gaze finds Maria’s across the room, and their shared look is electric. They know their lives will never be the same. CUT TO: EXT. GENEsis LABORATORY - DUSK The building that was once a beacon of hope now looks menacing as the shadows of dusk gather around it. Inside, something nefarious has been unleashed, unbeknownst to the joyous crowd departing the laboratory grounds. As the last of the daylight fades, a frightening new chapter in humanity’s history is about to be written in blood and darkness. FADE OUT. END OF PAGE 3 OF 150 PAGE 4 OF 150: INT. ED AND MARIA’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT The ambiance is cozy and warm as Ed and Maria step into the sanctuary of their home. Soft jazz fills the background, a stark contrast to the scientific sterility of the lab. They are enveloped by a euphoria that goes beyond the walls of professional achievement; this is deeply personal. As they unwind, Maria flips through a plethora of congratulatory messages from colleagues across the globe; her eyes sparkle with tears of joy. Ed pours two glasses of champagne, the bubbly mirroring the effervescence of the moment. MARIA (overwhelmed with emotion) To think, it’s not just about us… it’s about what this means for humanity. Ed raises his glass, acknowledging the weight of their work. ED (raises his glass) To a future forged by our hands.

The camera pans across the room, capturing the intimate setting—the scattered scientific journals, the bountiful bouquets, the polished accolades adorning the walls. Ed wraps his arms around Maria, and they share a slow dance, bodies swaying to the soothing rhythm of the music. The pressures of perfection and precision melt away, replaced by raw, unbounded love. ED (whispering in her ear) I love you. Now and for all the tomorrows. Maria slips her arms around his neck, her eyes closed, safe in the harbor of his embrace. MARIA Content, knowing we’ve done something miraculous. The moment is tender; the triumph is theirs. Little do they realize the horror that their beautiful discovery will unleash upon the world as they retreat from the distractions of their monumental success to savor the serenity of their life together. But peace is a precarious perch, and in their isolated bliss, a shadow of dread extends its reach, ready to eclipse tomorrow’s light. FADE OUT. END OF PAGE 4 OF 150 PAGE 5 OF 150: INT. GENEsis LABORATORY - NIGHT The once animated lab is now a vault of silence and shadows, sterile and still in the after-hours. Charts and diagrams adorn the walls, esoteric symbols of human ingenuity. A single light flickers overhead, casting an eerie glow over the room. Suddenly, the silence is shattered by the shrill sound of an emergency ALARM. Fluorescent lights snap to life, illuminating the lab in a clinical blaze. Monitors blink on, bathing the room in a pale electronic light. On the screens, SECURITY CAMERAS feed a harrowing sight. A once inert rat—a test subject meant to revolutionize medical science—twitches with unnatural vigor. Its eyes, milky with decay, snap open. It contorts, stands, and begins a frenzied scrabble against the glass of its enclosure. CUT TO: CLOSE-UP - MONITOR SCREEN Red emergency indicators pulse along the digital readouts. The rodent’s life signs, once flatlined, now spike erratically, a symphony of aberration. This is not life as known to the world of the living. A hand, clad in a lab coat, reaches into view and hits a PANIC BUTTON. The action triggers a cascade of protocols—doors lock, vents seal—but it’s too late. CUT TO: INT. GENEsis SECURITY ROOM - CONTINUOUS A lone GUARD snaps to attention, his previous drowsiness instantly forgotten. He scrutinizes the monitors, gripping the edge of the console, his knuckles whitening. GUARD (into his walkie-talkie) Code Black! We have a Code Black! Subject has— His voice catches, unable to comprehend or articulate the catastrophe being birthed before his eyes. INT. GENEsis LABORATORY - CONTINUOUS The rat gnashes at the glass, mindless and monstrous in its new existence. It is chaos given form, a Pandora’s box sprung open. Then, with a muffled crack, the enclosure gives way. The creature tumbles to the floor, lands with a sickening thud, but does not cease. It scurries off, into the bowels of the lab, into the city beyond. EXT. GENEsis LABORATORY - NIGHT Pandemonium is loosed upon the streets. As the creature disappears into the shadows of Science City, the alarm continues its futile wail, an air raid siren for an apocalypse of man’s own making. FADE OUT.

The audience leans forward, collectively holding their breath as graphs, data, and images of cellular regeneration fill the screen—a ballet of scientific wonder. Ed locks eyes with Maria, who nods. It is a silent exchange - they have crossed the Rubicon, there is no turning back. FADE OUT. END OF PAGE 6 OF 150 PAGE 7 OF 150: INT. GENEsis LABORATORY - RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT - DAY The sterile, high-tech room is alive with the quiet intensity of focus. Ed leads his team through the final checks. They move with clinical precision, operating advanced machinery and verifying vial after vial of the life-extending serum. Ed stands by a centrifuge, watching it whirl. His presence is calm, yet commanding. Maria looks over a data sheet, making annotations with a digital pen. Their rapport is seamless, a dance of intellect and intuition. ED (looking up from the centrifuge) Remember, every detail matters. This isn’t just science—it’s our legacy. Maria walks over to a microscope with several slides, lays them out neatly, and begins examining them one by one. Her face is lit by the blue glow of the digital readout. At a nearby station, a young researcher, JAMES, runs a simulation on a computer. The screen displays a 3D model of a rat’s DNA strand, flashing with the virtual injection of the serum. ED (to James) How are the longevity markers holding up? JAMES (focused on the screen) Stable and strong, Dr. Ed. If these rats could talk, they’d thank us for a few extra lifetimes. Maria glances over at James’s screen and gives Ed a reassuring nod. ED (giving final instructions) Alright, everyone. Let’s do one last walkthrough. This presentation will change everything. Let’s make sure we’re ready. The team members exchange determined looks; the burden of expectation is etched on their faces, spurring them on to double-check every result, every machine, every byte of data.

How do you plan to address the ethical issues arising from such a profound advance? Ed and Maria exchange a look, understanding the gravity of the question. With calm resolve, Ed responds. ED Ethics remain at the forefront of our research. We’ve established an oversight committee to explore the potential consequences and ensure responsible application. Our goal is to enhance life, not to disrupt the delicate balance of our society. Another hand shoots up, belonging to a young, inquisitive REPORTER. REPORTER Could this technology lead to overpopulation, if we’re all living longer—or even forever? Maria steps forward, her tone measured and reassuring. MARIA That’s a valid concern, and we’re working closely with global leaders in demography and sustainability. We’re advocates for a measured, phased approach to the introduction of this therapy. The questions come more rapidly now, from bioethicists, futurists, and the press. Each answer is more thoughtful than the last, portraying a team prepared for the depth of their discovery. A distinguished PROFESSOR clears his throat, attention focusing on him. PROFESSOR You’ve talked about the potential for this to fight disease, but is there a risk it could be weaponized or monopolized? ED (transparency in his voice) We’re acutely aware of that risk. Therefore, we’ve involved international health organizations from the onset to ensure equitable access. As for the former, stringent security protocols are in place to safeguard our work from unethical use. The power to extend life carries the responsibility to protect it. The question and answer session rolls on, punctuated by flashes from camera bulbs and scribbling pencils. As they continue to field inquiries, the depths of their commitment to this technology’s proper stewarding stand out against the backdrop of potential and peril. FADE OUT.

В этой игре, Эд участвует в гротескном телешоу, созданном человеком по имени Ханз Шоумастер. Шоу называется \\"Rundead\\", где Эд должен пройти через серию зловещих препятствий и испытаний, чтобы в конце концов встретиться с Беном. СЦЕНАРИЙ КОТОРЫЙ Я НАПИСАЛ ОН УЖАСЕН, ПОЭТОМУ ПРИДЕТСЯ ВСЕ СНАЧАЛО СДЕЛАТЬ Сначала фильм лучше начать в мирное время, а потом после это уже разрушительные здания. Например в фильме Эд был ученым в лаборотории. У нее жена тоже ученная. Они вместе с другими ученными поэксперементировали над крысами, чтобы сделать вечную жизнь, и вечную молодость и им это удалось. Они так обрадовались, начали мечтать о будущем, что за это станут выдающимися, популярными людьми, и заработают очень много денег. Они закрыли лабороторию и все пошли по домам ночью. Позже Эд со своей женной на машине приехали домой. Дети находятся у бабушки на пару дней, а родители развлекаются у дома, смотрят фильм, начинают общаться по поводу достижении будущего. Муж в очках начинает флиртовать, разводить ее, она накоонец-то сдается и они начинают заниматься сексом. Вскоре ночью произошло что то нехорошее, крыса умерла, после этого она превратилась в зомби, и каким то образом смогла сбежать с лаборотории. И крыса начинает заражать людей ночью. Родители в очках очень сильно запатели, издают стоны в кровати. Утром в воскресенье встают, идут на работу и они видят что крыса сбежала, не понимают что произошло. В понедельник в школах, в которых они учаться тоже заразились. Их дети пропали без вести, либо заразились. А бабушка заразилась. Родители посмотрели новость в лаборотории о том что начинается заражения в нашем городе. И они видят на улицах толпы зомби, родители переживают о детях, звонят бабушке, но она не принимает трубку, так как она уже заражена. Жена начинает плакать, муж начинает утешать, но лаборотория была почти полностью перекрыта зомбиями, в итоге зомби пробили дверь лаборотории, начинают заражать включая ее жену. Жена не успела принять вакцину, а его муж принял вакцину после того как укусили. Ему не было выхода как прыгнуть в окну, жена сказала живи или типо того, я всегда тебя любила, после это она пожертвовала собой ради его спасения. Он прыгнул в окно с очень высокого этажа, но он выжил, потому что почти полностью эволюционировал в зомби. Мир узнал о вторжении зомби-апокалипсис, начали всемирные переговоры и решили власти мира скинуть ядерную бомбу в город. Как только Эд узнал об этом в новостях, тут же скрылся очень глубоко под землю. В итоге не только все зомби вымерли, но и все люди проживающем в этом городе. Я очень плохо описал часть сюжета для начала так как это было мое виденье, но попробуйте как то преобразовать получше, так чтобы было более детально и просто. СЦЕНАРИЙ ДОЛЖЕН НАЧАТЬСЯ ВОТ ТАК: Полный сюжет фильма \\"RUN ZOMBIE, RUN\\": Акт 1: Введение в мир и персонажей Открытие фильма: • Фильм начинается в мирное время, в современном научном городе, где жизнь кипит и наука бурлит. • Эд – талантливый учёный, занятый исследованиями в области биотехнологий вместе со своей женой и коллегами. Они стоят на пороге прорыва: создания вакцины для вечной жизни и молодости. • Научный отдел в восторге от открытия, в лаборатории царит атмосфера торжества. После успешной презентации их эксперимента над крысами, Эд и его жена возвращаются домой, чтобы отпраздновать успех. Буря наступает: • Интимные моменты между Эдом и его женой дома. Они обсуждают планы на будущее, их романтическая встреча переходит в страстный вечер. Секс должен быть! • Когда после утро голые с обьятием жены в постели,и через некоторое время начинают звонить в телефон эда и сообщают что в вашем лаборотории что-то случилось не хорошее. • Радость прерывается известием о трагедии: инфицированная крыса умерла и восстала как зомби, сбежав из лаборатории и начав заражение города. • Пока Эд и его жена отдыхают, город погружается в хаос. Зомби-вирус быстро распространяется, затрагивая школы, больницы, улицы. Трагический перелом: • На следующее утро Эд и его жена возвращаются в лабораторию и обнаруживают сбежавшую крысу. Новости сообщают о массовом заражении. • Они пытаются дозвониться до детей и родственников, но безуспешно. Улицы заполнены зомби. Лаборатория осаждена толпой заражённых. • После нападения зомби, Эда укусили, и он принимает экспериментальную вакцину. Он вынужден покинуть свою жену, которая жертвует собой, чтобы спасти его. Ядерный удар: • Эд, полузомби, узнаёт о намерениях властей сбросить на город ядерную бомбу. С помощью своих новых способностей он прячется в подземном бункере. • Бомба стирает город с лица земли, уничтожая всех его обитателей, как живых, так и мёртвых. Акт 2: Развитие сюжета и персонажей Эд выходит на поверхность: • После взрыва Эд, один из немногих выживших, покидает своё убежище. Мир, который он знал, больше не существует. • Он встречает Бена, мальчика-сироту, выжившего в руинах города. Между ними завязывается необычная дружба. Выживание в разрушенном мире: • Эд и Бен ищут припасы и остатки цивилизации, стараясь выжить среди развалин и постоянной угрозы зомби. • По мере их путешествия за руинами, Эд начинает терять остатки своего человечества и борется с внутренними демонами. Акт 3: Кульминация и разрешение конфликта Шоу \\"Rundead\\": • Ханз Шоумастер, выживший продюсер, создаёт телешоу \\"Rundead\\" и похищает Бена, чтобы использовать его в качестве приза для Эда. • Эд, теперь полностью зомби, но сохранивший воспоминания о Бене, проходит через жестокие испытания шоу. Финальная битва и трагедия: • Эд освобождает Бена, но внезапно теряет остатки человечности и атакует его, не в силах сопротивляться своему зомби-инстинкту. • Бен превращается в зомби, и они уходят вместе, оставляя мир во власти хаоса и зомби-апокалипсиса. Заключение: • Фильм заканчивается на тёмной ноте. Эд и Бен, теперь оба зомби, сидят на разрушенном мосту, смотря на новый мир, который никогда не будет таким, каким был когда-то. Мария - Жена Эда (учёная) Фильм \\"RUN ZOMBIE, RUN\\" показывает темную сторону человеческой изобретательности и последствия игры с природой. Со смешанными чувствами ужаса и сочувствия зрители следят за путешествием Эда от великого открытия до конечного падения в бездну живых мертвецов. Саундтреки будут браться из оригинальной игры BEN AND ED (2015 года) Дополнительные саундтреки: 1. Песня Yota - The Runner, финальная сцена, где зомби ED будет бежать c предпринимателем HANZ SHOWMASTER который создал величайшее в мире шоу и будут преодолевать препятствии. Зомби ЭД столкнет HANZ SHOWMASTER c площадки и он умирает 2. Песня The Cranberries - Zombie, сцена, где весь механизм вышел из под контроля, испытания стали чрезвычайно сложными, и люди которые смотрят это шоу начинают убегать от атаков зомби. Время продолжает заканчиваться и платформа в очень скором времени падает в лаву. Зомби ED берет в себя в руки и начинает быстро преодолевать все препятствия под эту песню за одну минуту, пока время полностью не истекало. Последние секунды заканчивается и платформа начинает падать в лаву. ED перепрыгивает из платформы и ухватывается руками на землю. А дальше он старается подняться из земли, чтобы не упасть в раскаленную лаву.

She’s as engaged as Ed, her expression a mixture of concentration and pride. MARIA (to Ed) Heart rate steady, brain activity normal. She’s ready. Ed turns his attention to a SYRINGE filled with a luminous liquid— their latest concoction promising life everlasting. ED This is it, the culmination of our life’s work. Ed injects the serum into the rat. Everyone holds their breath. A tense moment passes, and then— The rat’s eyes flash open. Its vitals surge on the screens. Suddenly, spontaneous applause breaks out. The team exchanges looks of disbelief and joy. Ed and Maria share a moment of triumph. ED (over the applause, to Maria) We’ve made history today. Maria beams, a tear of joy in her eye. CUT TO: INT. ED AND MARIA’S CAR - NIGHT Driving home, the city lights twinkle through the window, reflecting the sparkle in Maria’s eyes. Ed’s at the wheel, quiet but visibly elated. MARIA (squeezing Ed’s hand) Can you imagine? Disease, aging, death— things of the past. Ed looks at Maria, his smile says it all. They are the pioneers of a new frontier. ED And to think, it all started with one little rat. They share a look of excitement and anticipation, not knowing that their breakthrough is about to spark a catastrophe beyond their wildest nightmares. CUT TO: EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT As Ed and Maria drive home, the city is vibrant, alive. But there’s an undercurrent of tension as sirens are heard in the distance. Something unsettling is in the air. Pulling into their driveway, they are unaware that the world they know is about to be thrown into terrifying chaos. FADE TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 2 OF 150 PAGE 3 OF 150: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY The opulent conference room is abuzz with the electric hum of anticipation. Academic elites, top scientists, and influential backers fill the ornate space. Everyone’s attention is riveted on the podium at the front, where Ed stands confidently beside a covered enclosure. ED (sweeping his arms wide) I present to you the future— a triumph over death itself. With a flourish, Ed pulls back the drape to reveal a glass habitat inside which a vivacious white rat scurries about playfully. The audience erupts into a thunderous standing ovation. Flashbulbs pop and the room is awash with applause. At the back, Maria, Ed’s intellectual and emotional partner, beams with pride. Her eyes shimmer with an amalgam of love, respect, and shared dreams. She claps with genuine admiration. ED (raising his voice to be heard over the clamor) This is merely the beginning. Today we celebrate not the end, but the dawn of a new era in biotechnology. One where eternal youth is not just a fantasy. The clamor grows louder as reporters clamor for comments, their questions flying fast and furious. Ed, the paragon of composure, engages with the media with the ease of someone who has done this many times before. MARIA (hugging a fellow scientist) We did it, we really did it! The fellow scientist nods, equally excited. Ed’s gaze finds Maria’s across the room, and their shared look is electric. They know their lives will never be the same. CUT TO: EXT. GENEsis LABORATORY - DUSK The building that was once a beacon of hope now looks menacing as the shadows of dusk gather around it. Inside, something nefarious has been unleashed, unbeknownst to the joyous crowd departing the laboratory grounds. As the last of the daylight fades, a frightening new chapter in humanity’s history is about to be written in blood and darkness. FADE OUT. END OF PAGE 3 OF 150 PAGE 4 OF 150: INT.

What you are about to witness is not just a leap forward in biotechnology, but a paradigm shift in our understanding of life itself. (The audience murmurs with intrigue.) ED (CONT’D) For centuries, humanity has grappled with the inevitability of aging, disease, and death. But imagine a world where these constraints are no longer our destiny; a world where the human lifespan is not a clock winding down, but a canvas waiting for us to paint our prolonged tales. (Spectators nod, some leaning in as they absorb the weight of his words.) ED (CONT’D) At GENEsis Laboratories, we dare to venture beyond the frontier of current medical science. Through rigorous research and relentless dedication, we have discovered a way to not only halt the aging process but to reverse it. A collective gasp echoes through the hall and Ed allows a small smile, a hint of pride in his steady gaze. ED (CONT’D) Our breakthrough is anchored in the very building blocks of life - DNA. By harnessing and enhancing the body’s natural regenerative capabilities, we are on the cusp of unlocking the elixir of youth. Ed pauses, letting the implications of his words sink in. Behind him, a screen lights up displaying the image of the extraordinary white rat. ED (CONT’D) This, ladies and gentlemen, is our proof of concept—a subject whose biological clock has not only been stopped but turned back. The applications of this research are vast and the implications profound. The audience is rapt; some are shaking their heads in disbelief, while others appear deep in thought. Ed’s passion is evident, his hope infectious. ED (CONT’D) We stand before a new dawn. As we embark on this journey, we must tread with caution, for the path of innovation is fraught with moral and ethical challenges. But it is our belief that the benefits to mankind will be immeasurable. A round of applause begins to swell, drowning out Ed’s final words as he acknowledges the ovation with humble nods. Maria’s face lights up with pride and vindication as she watches her husband captivate the crowd. FADE OUT. END OF PAGE 9 OF 150 PAGE 10 OF 150: INT. GENEsis LABORATORY - PRESENTATION HALL - DAY The applause fades, and ED regains control of the room. He advances the slide, revealing a timeline of their experiments, the progression from theory to reality. ED (to the audience) Allow me to take you on a journey through our research. These milestones are not just scientific achievements, but stepping stones to our future. The audience watches intently as images flicker across the screen: a petri dish, cellular divisions, time-lapse footage of the rat showing reversal signs of aging. ED (CONT’D) What started as a pursuit of knowledge has become a beacon of hope. This is not science fiction; it’s science fact. Maria watches from the front row, a surge of pride swelling within her. Her eyes are fixed on Ed, her belief in their work unwavering. Suddenly, the room’s attention narrows on a real-time display of the rat’s current condition. The creature is active, its movements vibrant and youthful. ED (CONT’D) Behold, the evidence of our success. Our test subject, now rejuvenated, previously showed all the hallmarks of advanced age. Now, it is as vivacious as a newborn, perhaps even more so. A technical assistant carefully handles the enclosure, allowing the guests to observe the undeniable vigor of the animal. A murmur of disbelief and awe spreads through the crowd. Ed stands back, letting the reality of the discovery sink in. His confident demeanor serves as a reassuring presence in the face of the staggering implications. ED (CONT’D) Imagine the diseases we will cure, the lives we will extend, the mysteries of aging we will unravel. The screen shows diagrams of DNA strands, neatly highlighting the parts that they have successfully modified. ED (CONT’D) Our method is a delicate orchestration of gene therapy combined with a bespoke cocktail of enzymes and growth factors. The results, as you can see, are transformative. He pauses a beat, allowing the weight of his revelation to permeate the room. ED (CONT’D) Tonight, as you lay your heads down to sleep, you will do so knowing that the dawn we wake to offers not just a new day, but the potential of a new era for all of humanity. Comprehensive applause erupts in the hall, louder and more sustained than before. Maria joins in, her eyes watery with emotion. Through the cacophony, Ed’s gaze finds her face, and their shared smile speaks volumes—the future, fraught with unknowns, also brims with possibility. ED (CONT’D) (over the applause) Together, we will venture into this new horizon of hope. Thank you. Ed steps back from the podium, and the stage lights dim slightly, a signal of the session’s end. The room, still abuzz with excited chatter, begins to dispel as attendees move towards the exits and others rush to converse with Ed and his team. FADE OUT. END OF PAGE 10 OF 150 PAGE 11 OF 150: INT. GENEsis LABORATORY - PRESENTATION HALL - DAY The post-presentation buzz fills the hall as eager attendees gather around ED and MARIA, their questions an inquisitive hum in the otherwise serene aftermath. Some hold recorders, others notepads; all seek to delve deeper into the ramifications of this scientific miracle. ED (eager to engage) Yes, Dr. Abbott, go ahead. DR. ABBOTT, an eminent biologist, pushes his way to the front, his face marked with a blend of astonishment and skepticism. DR. ABBOTT The implications of reversing aging are staggering. How do you plan to address the ethical issues arising from such a profound advance? Ed and Maria exchange a look, understanding the gravity of the question. With calm resolve, Ed responds. ED Ethics remain at the forefront of our research. We’ve established an oversight committee to explore the potential consequences and ensure responsible application. Our goal is to enhance life, not to disrupt the delicate balance of our society. Another hand shoots up, belonging to a young, inquisitive REPORTER. REPORTER Could this technology lead to overpopulation, if we’re all living longer—or even forever? Maria steps forward, her tone measured and reassuring. MARIA That’s a valid concern, and we’re working closely with global leaders in demography and sustainability. We’re advocates for a measured, phased approach to the introduction of this therapy. The questions come more rapidly now, from bioethicists, futurists, and the press. Each answer is more thoughtful than the last, portraying a team prepared for the depth of their discovery. A distinguished PROFESSOR clears his throat, attention focusing on him. PROFESSOR You’ve talked about the potential for this to fight disease, but is there a risk it could be weaponized or monopolized? ED (transparency in his voice) We’re acutely aware of that risk. Therefore, we’ve involved international health organizations from the onset to ensure equitable access. As for the former, stringent security protocols are in place to safeguard our work from unethical use. The power to extend life carries the responsibility to protect it. The question and answer session rolls on, punctuated by flashes from camera bulbs and scribbling pencils. As they continue to field inquiries, the depths of their commitment to this technology’s proper stewarding stand out against the backdrop of potential and peril. FADE OUT.

GENEsis LABORATORY - RECEPTION HALL - EVENING The elegantly decorated reception hall is filled with the soft glow of chandeliers and the murmur of a well-heeled crowd. Guests in formal attire meander through the room, clinking glasses and discussing the revolutionary presentation they’ve just witnessed. At the center of the room, ED and MARIA gratefully accept congratulations from their peers, their faces reflecting the glow of success. Waiters navigate the space with trays of champagne and delicate canapés. CUT TO: CLOSE-UP - A HANDSHAKE between Ed and CHANCELLOR WEST, an influential member of the scientific community. CHANCELLOR WEST (grasping Ed’s hand firmly) Your presentation was exceptional, Ed. The whole city is talking about it. ED (smiling modestly) Thank you, Chancellor. We hope to live up to the expectations. Maria, ever present by Ed’s side, is engaged in conversation with a GROUP OF INVESTORS, her charisma and intelligence shining through as she articulates the project’s potential. MARIA (to the investors) We’re just scratching the surface. The possibilities are limitless. Investors nod, expressions filled with a mix of greed and genuine excitement for the future. CUT TO: ED (leaning in, to Chancellor West) Still, there are concerns—ethical, social. We must proceed with the utmost care. CHANCELLOR WEST (nodding, gravely) Indeed. Great power comes with heavy responsibility. Eyes around the world will be watching. CUT TO: ACROSS THE ROOM A CORNER where two FIGURES converse in hushed tones. One is DR. ROSENBERG, shrouded in skepticism, his eyes darting towards Ed and Maria. DR. ROSENBERG (whispering) The implications… Are they fully prepared for the consequences? His companion, MS. SHARPE, a noted bioethicist, takes a sip of her drink, her gaze sharp and calculating. MS. SHARPE That remains to be seen. Innovation and precaution must walk hand in hand. Let’s hope the GENEsis team understands that. BACK TO ED AND MARIA ED (to another group of colleagues) We’ve considered the ramifications. We’re not just chasing after immortality; we’re seeking to improve quality of life. MARIA (chiming in) That’s right. We must ensure that this technology serves humanity, not diminishes it. The conversational exchanges continue to crisscross the room, an interwoven tapestry of hope and foreboding. Guests sip their drinks, but there’s an undercurrent of uncertainty that even the bubbling champagne can’t dissipate. The room is filled with a sense of destiny in the making—a feeling that tonight, the future has begun to unfold. FADE TO BLACK.

GENEsis LABORATORY - MARIA’S OFFICE - NIGHT The room is hushed, insulated from the buzz of the reception outside. A large window offers a view of the city skyline, twinkling under the mantle of night. MARIA stands by the glass, lost in thought, her silhouette a portrait of contemplation. Her office, usually an epicenter of activity, is now a sanctum of quiet reflection. ED enters, closing the door softly behind him. There’s a magnetism between them as he approaches, the shared burdens and triumphs of their work enveloping them like a cloak. The clink of glass and faint laughter from the celebration seep through the walls, a reminder of the world outside. CUT TO: CLOSE-UP - MARIA’S FACE, illuminated by the city lights, her eyes shining with unshed tears. MARIA (voice soft with emotion) We’ve done more than I ever dreamed. Yet tonight, I can’t shake off a sense of foreboding… ED wraps his arms around her waist, drawing her close. Their connection is as palpable as the air they breathe, their union strengthened by the challenges they’ve faced. ED (reassuringly) We’ve tread through the unknown, shaped the future. Any fear we feel is a reminder of our responsibility. They stand in shared silence, their gaze on the sprawling city below—a testament to humanity’s relentless advance. CUT TO: TWO SHOT - ED AND MARIA together, framed against the cityscape. Ed rests his chin on Maria’s shoulder, their reflections woven into the tapestry of lights. ED (softly) What matters now is that we navigate the path ahead with caution. For every miracle we’ve created, there’s a responsibility we can’t ignore. MARIA (turning to face him) Our dreams could become nightmares if we’re not careful. The joy of discovery, the weight of consequence—we carry them both. ED (nodding) Together, we’ll face whatever comes. Our love, our bond… it’s our anchor amidst the storm. They share a tender kiss, a moment of solace away from prying eyes and probing questions. It’s a promise, a vow unspoken but deeply felt—an acknowledgment of their unity and unwavering support for each other. FADE OUT.

ED and MARIA close down their workstations, their faces a stark contrast of triumph and trepidation. Ed powers off the last computer with a lingering touch, almost reluctant to let go of the day’s events. MARIA (gently) We stand at a crossroads, Ed. Our work has the power to alter the course of humanity. ED (softly) For all the promise it holds, it also carries a shadow of risk. The weight of that is… tremendous. Together, they cast a final look across the lab, a cauldron of potential now whispering with secrets yet to unfold. They exit, locking the secrets within the laboratory walls. EXT. ED AND MARIA’S CAR - NIGHT Under a cloak of stars, the couple drive away, leaving the beacon of GENEsis behind. The car’s interior is a sanctuary of shared silence—a stillness fraught with the unspoken thrill of success and the creeping dread of the unknown. MARIA (eyes on the road) There’s no retreating from the path we’ve taken. ED (firmly) We face whatever comes. With clarity, with unity. Always together. Their hands intertwine, bridging the gap between their quiet anxieties and the fiercely held hope that anchors them. CUT TO: INT. ED AND MARIA’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT The house, a realm separate from scientific breakthroughs and ethical quandaries, welcomes them with gentle shadows and a familiar sense of intimacy. Glasses of wine in hand, they find solace in each other’s company, a bastion against the coming storm. MARIA (soft chuckle) Science aside, I’m grateful for this—this quiet moment with you. It’s the still point in a turning world. ED (eyes meeting hers) Amidst everything, you’re my constant, Maria. The heart of my universe. They drink to that constancy, to the refuge they find when the weight of the world retreats in the face of their love. FADE OUT. END OF PAGE 14 OF 150 PAGE 15 OF 150: INT. ED AND MARIA’S CAR - EVENING Inside the car, the mood is one of celebration and contemplation. They navigate the road, each turn moving them further from the lab—an emblem of their progress—and closer to their sanctuary of normalcy. Laughter and warm exchanges fill the space. ED No prediction could ever account for how today unfolded. We’re pioneers on an uncharted frontier. MARIA (eyes softening) And what we’ve begun… it’s both exhilarating and intimidating. Pulling up in their driveway, they allow a moment for the day’s reality to settle like dusk around them. Exiting the car, they carry with them the gravity of their roles in shaping tomorrow. EXT. ED’S HOUSE - BACK PORCH - LATER The stars adorn the night sky as Ed and Maria, wrapped in each other’s arms, set the bottle of wine down on a side table. The porch is their stage, the cool breeze whispers secrets for the morrow—a moment etched in tranquillity. MARIA (raising her glass) To us, to our dreams, to a future painted with the colors we choose. ED (holding his glass high) A future where every possibility, every hope, is within our reach. Their eyes meet, alight with a love that’s weathered storms and may yet face more. The night envelopes them in gentle reassurance, even as darker currents surge unseen, beyond the edges of their vision. FADE TO BLACK.

ED AND MARIA’S HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT The living room is swathed in soft, warm lighting, casting an intimate glow over ED and MARIA, who sit closely together on the plush sofa, elegantly set with a sleek modern design that contrasts the traditional, romantic atmosphere. In front of them, a low table adorned with a bouquet of fresh flowers and a pair of flickering candles. An unfinished bottle of red wine breathes beside two half-empty glasses. Maria leans into Ed, snuggling under his arm as they reminisce about their day’s success and dream about what the future holds. MARIA (smiling lovingly at Ed) To think… we might have just unlocked the secrets of eternal youth. ED (looking into her eyes) And I couldn’t have done it without you—the brilliant mind and the beating heart of our team. Maria blushes at the compliment, looking down modestly before meeting his gaze again. MARIA (raising her glass) To our discovery, our future… and to us. Ed raises his glass, clinking it gently against Maria’s. They sip the rich wine, a musical choir of distant night sounds serenading them. ED (earnestly) Through every trial, our partnership has only grown stronger. Whatever the future brings, we’ll face it together. The camera slowly zooms in as Ed and Maria gently put their glasses down and turn towards each other. Maria gently frames Ed’s face with her hands and whispers softly. MARIA I feel like this is just the beginning. A new chapter… Ed captures her lips with his, deepening their kiss as gentle music begins to rise.

В этой игре, Эд участвует в гротескном телешоу, созданном человеком по имени Ханз Шоумастер. Шоу называется \\"Rundead\\", где Эд должен пройти через серию зловещих препятствий и испытаний, чтобы в конце концов встретиться с Беном. СЦЕНАРИЙ КОТОРЫЙ Я НАПИСАЛ ОН УЖАСЕН, ПОЭТОМУ ПРИДЕТСЯ ВСЕ СНАЧАЛО СДЕЛАТЬ Сначала фильм лучше начать в мирное время, а потом после это уже разрушительные здания. Например в фильме Эд был ученым в лаборотории. У нее жена тоже ученная. Они вместе с другими ученными поэксперементировали над крысами, чтобы сделать вечную жизнь, и вечную молодость и им это удалось. Они так обрадовались, начали мечтать о будущем, что за это станут выдающимися, популярными людьми, и заработают очень много денег. Они закрыли лабороторию и все пошли по домам ночью. Позже Эд со своей женной на машине приехали домой. Дети находятся у бабушки на пару дней, а родители развлекаются у дома, смотрят фильм, начинают общаться по поводу достижении будущего. Муж в очках начинает флиртовать, разводить ее, она накоонец-то сдается и они начинают заниматься сексом. Вскоре ночью произошло что то нехорошее, крыса умерла, после этого она превратилась в зомби, и каким то образом смогла сбежать с лаборотории. И крыса начинает заражать людей ночью. Родители в очках очень сильно запатели, издают стоны в кровати. Утром в воскресенье встают, идут на работу и они видят что крыса сбежала, не понимают что произошло. В понедельник в школах, в которых они учаться тоже заразились. Их дети пропали без вести, либо заразились. А бабушка заразилась. Родители посмотрели новость в лаборотории о том что начинается заражения в нашем городе. И они видят на улицах толпы зомби, родители переживают о детях, звонят бабушке, но она не принимает трубку, так как она уже заражена. Жена начинает плакать, муж начинает утешать, но лаборотория была почти полностью перекрыта зомбиями, в итоге зомби пробили дверь лаборотории, начинают заражать включая ее жену. Жена не успела принять вакцину, а его муж принял вакцину после того как укусили. Ему не было выхода как прыгнуть в окну, жена сказала живи или типо того, я всегда тебя любила, после это она пожертвовала собой ради его спасения. Он прыгнул в окно с очень высокого этажа, но он выжил, потому что почти полностью эволюционировал в зомби. Мир узнал о вторжении зомби-апокалипсис, начали всемирные переговоры и решили власти мира скинуть ядерную бомбу в город. Как только Эд узнал об этом в новостях, тут же скрылся очень глубоко под землю. В итоге не только все зомби вымерли, но и все люди проживающем в этом городе. Я очень плохо описал часть сюжета для начала так как это было мое виденье, но попробуйте как то преобразовать получше, так чтобы было более детально и просто. СЦЕНАРИЙ ДОЛЖЕН НАЧАТЬСЯ ВОТ ТАК: Полный сюжет фильма \\"RUN ZOMBIE, RUN\\": Акт 1: Введение в мир и персонажей Открытие фильма: • Фильм начинается в мирное время, в современном научном городе, где жизнь кипит и наука бурлит. • Эд – талантливый учёный, занятый исследованиями в области биотехнологий вместе со своей женой и коллегами. Они стоят на пороге прорыва: создания вакцины для вечной жизни и молодости. • Научный отдел в восторге от открытия, в лаборатории царит атмосфера торжества. После успешной презентации их эксперимента над крысами, Эд и его жена возвращаются домой, чтобы отпраздновать успех. Буря наступает: • Интимные моменты между Эдом и его женой дома. Они обсуждают планы на будущее, их романтическая встреча переходит в страстный вечер. Секс должен быть! • Когда после утро голые с обьятием жены в постели,и через некоторое время начинают звонить в телефон эда и сообщают что в вашем лаборотории что-то случилось не хорошее. • Радость прерывается известием о трагедии: инфицированная крыса умерла и восстала как зомби, сбежав из лаборатории и начав заражение города. • Пока Эд и его жена отдыхают, город погружается в хаос. Зомби-вирус быстро распространяется, затрагивая школы, больницы, улицы. Трагический перелом: • На следующее утро Эд и его жена возвращаются в лабораторию и обнаруживают сбежавшую крысу. Новости сообщают о массовом заражении. • Они пытаются дозвониться до детей и родственников, но безуспешно. Улицы заполнены зомби. Лаборатория осаждена толпой заражённых. • После нападения зомби, Эда укусили, и он принимает экспериментальную вакцину. Он вынужден покинуть свою жену, которая жертвует собой, чтобы спасти его. Ядерный удар: • Эд, полузомби, узнаёт о намерениях властей сбросить на город ядерную бомбу. С помощью своих новых способностей он прячется в подземном бункере. • Бомба стирает город с лица земли, уничтожая всех его обитателей, как живых, так и мёртвых. Акт 2: Развитие сюжета и персонажей Эд выходит на поверхность: • После взрыва Эд, один из немногих выживших, покидает своё убежище. Мир, который он знал, больше не существует. • Он встречает Бена, мальчика-сироту, выжившего в руинах города. Между ними завязывается необычная дружба. Выживание в разрушенном мире: • Эд и Бен ищут припасы и остатки цивилизации, стараясь выжить среди развалин и постоянной угрозы зомби. • По мере их путешествия за руинами, Эд начинает терять остатки своего человечества и борется с внутренними демонами. Акт 3: Кульминация и разрешение конфликта Шоу \\"Rundead\\": • Ханз Шоумастер, выживший продюсер, создаёт телешоу \\"Rundead\\" и похищает Бена, чтобы использовать его в качестве приза для Эда. • Эд, теперь полностью зомби, но сохранивший воспоминания о Бене, проходит через жестокие испытания шоу. Финальная битва и трагедия: • Эд освобождает Бена, но внезапно теряет остатки человечности и атакует его, не в силах сопротивляться своему зомби-инстинкту. • Бен превращается в зомби, и они уходят вместе, оставляя мир во власти хаоса и зомби-апокалипсиса. Заключение: • Фильм заканчивается на тёмной ноте. Эд и Бен, теперь оба зомби, сидят на разрушенном мосту, смотря на новый мир, который никогда не будет таким, каким был когда-то. Мария - Жена Эда (учёная) Фильм \\"RUN ZOMBIE, RUN\\" показывает темную сторону человеческой изобретательности и последствия игры с природой. Со смешанными чувствами ужаса и сочувствия зрители следят за путешествием Эда от великого открытия до конечного падения в бездну живых мертвецов. Саундтреки будут браться из оригинальной игры BEN AND ED (2015 года) Дополнительные саундтреки: 1. Песня Yota - The Runner, финальная сцена, где зомби ED будет бежать c предпринимателем HANZ SHOWMASTER который создал величайшее в мире шоу и будут преодолевать препятствии.

Our goal is to enhance life, not to disrupt the delicate balance of our society. Another hand shoots up, belonging to a young, inquisitive REPORTER. REPORTER Could this technology lead to overpopulation, if we’re all living longer—or even forever? Maria steps forward, her tone measured and reassuring. MARIA That’s a valid concern, and we’re working closely with global leaders in demography and sustainability. We’re advocates for a measured, phased approach to the introduction of this therapy. The questions come more rapidly now, from bioethicists, futurists, and the press. Each answer is more thoughtful than the last, portraying a team prepared for the depth of their discovery. A distinguished PROFESSOR clears his throat, attention focusing on him. PROFESSOR You’ve talked about the potential for this to fight disease, but is there a risk it could be weaponized or monopolized? ED (transparency in his voice) We’re acutely aware of that risk. Therefore, we’ve involved international health organizations from the onset to ensure equitable access. As for the former, stringent security protocols are in place to safeguard our work from unethical use. The power to extend life carries the responsibility to protect it.

GENEsis LABORATORY - RECEPTION HALL - EVENING The elegantly decorated reception hall is filled with the soft glow of chandeliers and the murmur of a well-heeled crowd. Guests in formal attire meander through the room, clinking glasses and discussing the revolutionary presentation they’ve just witnessed. At the center of the room, ED and MARIA gratefully accept congratulations from their peers, their faces reflecting the glow of success. Waiters navigate the space with trays of champagne and delicate canapés. CUT TO: CLOSE-UP - A HANDSHAKE between Ed and CHANCELLOR WEST, an influential member of the scientific community. CHANCELLOR WEST (grasping Ed’s hand firmly) Your presentation was exceptional, Ed. The whole city is talking about it. ED (smiling modestly) Thank you, Chancellor. We hope to live up to the expectations. Maria, ever present by Ed’s side, is engaged in conversation with a GROUP OF INVESTORS, her charisma and intelligence shining through as she articulates the project’s potential. MARIA (to the investors) We’re just scratching the surface. The possibilities are limitless. Investors nod, expressions filled with a mix of greed and genuine excitement for the future. CUT TO: ED (leaning in, to Chancellor West) Still, there are concerns—ethical, social. We must proceed with the utmost care. CHANCELLOR WEST (nodding, gravely) Indeed. Great power comes with heavy responsibility. Eyes around the world will be watching. CUT TO: ACROSS THE ROOM A CORNER where two FIGURES converse in hushed tones. One is DR. ROSENBERG, shrouded in skepticism, his eyes darting towards Ed and Maria. DR. ROSENBERG (whispering) The implications… Are they fully prepared for the consequences? His companion, MS. SHARPE, a noted bioethicist, takes a sip of her drink, her gaze sharp and calculating. MS. SHARPE That remains to be seen. Innovation and precaution must walk hand in hand. Let’s hope the GENEsis team understands that. BACK TO ED AND MARIA ED (to another group of colleagues) We’ve considered the ramifications. We’re not just chasing after immortality; we’re seeking to improve quality of life. MARIA (chiming in) That’s right. We must ensure that this technology serves humanity, not diminishes it. The conversational exchanges continue to crisscross the room, an interwoven tapestry of hope and foreboding. Guests sip their drinks, but there’s an undercurrent of uncertainty that even the bubbling champagne can’t dissipate. The room is filled with a sense of destiny in the making—a feeling that tonight, the future has begun to unfold. FADE TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 12 OF 150 [Note: As the film progresses, the layers of intrigue and tension increase, leading Ed and Maria into the dark heart of their creation’s unintended consequences.] PAGE 13 OF 150: INT. GENEsis LABORATORY - MARIA’S OFFICE - NIGHT The room is hushed, insulated from the buzz of the reception outside. A large window offers a view of the city skyline, twinkling under the mantle of night. MARIA stands by the glass, lost in thought, her silhouette a portrait of contemplation. Her office, usually an epicenter of activity, is now a sanctum of quiet reflection. ED enters, closing the door softly behind him. There’s a magnetism between them as he approaches, the shared burdens and triumphs of their work enveloping them like a cloak. The clink of glass and faint laughter from the celebration seep through the walls, a reminder of the world outside. CUT TO: CLOSE-UP - MARIA’S FACE, illuminated by the city lights, her eyes shining with unshed tears. MARIA (voice soft with emotion) We’ve done more than I ever dreamed. Yet tonight, I can’t shake off a sense of foreboding… ED wraps his arms around her waist, drawing her close. Their connection is as palpable as the air they breathe, their union strengthened by the challenges they’ve faced. ED (reassuringly) We’ve tread through the unknown, shaped the future. Any fear we feel is a reminder of our responsibility. They stand in shared silence, their gaze on the sprawling city below—a testament to humanity’s relentless advance. CUT TO: TWO SHOT - ED AND MARIA together, framed against the cityscape. Ed rests his chin on Maria’s shoulder, their reflections woven into the tapestry of lights. ED (softly) What matters now is that we navigate the path ahead with caution. For every miracle we’ve created, there’s a responsibility we can’t ignore. MARIA (turning to face him) Our dreams could become nightmares if we’re not careful. The joy of discovery, the weight of consequence—we carry them both. ED (nodding) Together, we’ll face whatever comes. Our love, our bond… it’s our anchor amidst the storm. They share a tender kiss, a moment of solace away from prying eyes and probing questions. It’s a promise, a vow unspoken but deeply felt—an acknowledgment of their unity and unwavering support for each other. FADE OUT. END OF PAGE 13 OF 150 [Note: The screenplay will deepen the complexity of Ed and Maria’s relationship as they grapple with the consequences of their work and the outbreak that follows.] PAGE 14 OF 150: INT. GENEsis LABORATORY - LATE NIGHT The lab, now silent and still, echoes the absence of the day’s fervor. ED and MARIA close down their workstations, their faces a stark contrast of triumph and trepidation. Ed powers off the last computer with a lingering touch, almost reluctant to let go of the day’s events. MARIA (gently) We stand at a crossroads, Ed. Our work has the power to alter the course of humanity. ED (softly) For all the promise it holds, it also carries a shadow of risk. The weight of that is… tremendous. Together, they cast a final look across the lab, a cauldron of potential now whispering with secrets yet to unfold. They exit, locking the secrets within the laboratory walls. EXT. ED AND MARIA’S CAR - NIGHT Under a cloak of stars, the couple drive away, leaving the beacon of GENEsis behind. The car’s interior is a sanctuary of shared silence—a stillness fraught with the unspoken thrill of success and the creeping dread of the unknown. MARIA (eyes on the road) There’s no retreating from the path we’ve taken. ED (firmly) We face whatever comes. With clarity, with unity. Always together. Their hands intertwine, bridging the gap between their quiet anxieties and the fiercely held hope that anchors them. CUT TO: INT. ED AND MARIA’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT The house, a realm separate from scientific breakthroughs and ethical quandaries, welcomes them with gentle shadows and a familiar sense of intimacy. Glasses of wine in hand, they find solace in each other’s company, a bastion against the coming storm. MARIA (soft chuckle) Science aside, I’m grateful for this—this quiet moment with you. It’s the still point in a turning world. ED (eyes meeting hers) Amidst everything, you’re my constant, Maria. The heart of my universe. They drink to that constancy, to the refuge they find when the weight of the world retreats in the face of their love. FADE OUT. END OF PAGE 14 OF 150 PAGE 15 OF 150: INT. ED AND MARIA’S CAR - EVENING Inside the car, the mood is one of celebration and contemplation. They navigate the road, each turn moving them further from the lab—an emblem of their progress—and closer to their sanctuary of normalcy. Laughter and warm exchanges fill the space. ED No prediction could ever account for how today unfolded. We’re pioneers on an uncharted frontier. MARIA (eyes softening) And what we’ve begun… it’s both exhilarating and intimidating. Pulling up in their driveway, they allow a moment for the day’s reality to settle like dusk around them. Exiting the car, they carry with them the gravity of their roles in shaping tomorrow. EXT. ED’S HOUSE - BACK PORCH - LATER The stars adorn the night sky as Ed and Maria, wrapped in each other’s arms, set the bottle of wine down on a side table. The porch is their stage, the cool breeze whispers secrets for the morrow—a moment etched in tranquillity. MARIA (raising her glass) To us, to our dreams, to a future painted with the colors we choose. ED (holding his glass high) A future where every possibility, every hope, is within our reach. Their eyes meet, alight with a love that’s weathered storms and may yet face more. The night envelopes them in gentle reassurance, even as darker currents surge unseen, beyond the edges of their vision. FADE TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 15 OF 150 (As the narrative unfolds, Ed and Maria will face the unfolding terror of a world succumbing to the horrors their creation inadvertently unleashed. Standing side by side, they will confront the pandemonium as it threatens to swallow everything they cherish.)

Ed and Maria’s lives are forever changed, as they must now navigate the cataclysm they inadvertently contributed to.] PAGE 16 OF 150: INT. ED AND MARIA’S HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT The living room is swathed in soft, warm lighting, casting an intimate glow over ED and MARIA, who sit closely together on the plush sofa, elegantly set with a sleek modern design that contrasts the traditional, romantic atmosphere. In front of them, a low table adorned with a bouquet of fresh flowers and a pair of flickering candles. An unfinished bottle of red wine breathes beside two half-empty glasses. Maria leans into Ed, snuggling under his arm as they reminisce about their day’s success and dream about what the future holds. MARIA (smiling lovingly at Ed) To think… we might have just unlocked the secrets of eternal youth. ED (looking into her eyes) And I couldn’t have done it without you—the brilliant mind and the beating heart of our team. Maria blushes at the compliment, looking down modestly before meeting his gaze again. MARIA (raising her glass) To our discovery, our future… and to us. Ed raises his glass, clinking it gently against Maria’s. They sip the rich wine, a musical choir of distant night sounds serenading them. ED (earnestly) Through every trial, our partnership has only grown stronger. Whatever the future brings, we’ll face it together. The camera slowly zooms in as Ed and Maria gently put their glasses down and turn towards each other. Maria gently frames Ed’s face with her hands and whispers softly. MARIA I feel like this is just the beginning. A new chapter… Ed captures her lips with his, deepening their kiss as gentle music begins to rise. The screenplay notes focus on their silhouettes against the backdrop of candlelight, a moment suspended in time. FADE OUT. END OF PAGE 16 OF 150 PAGE 17 OF 150: INT. ED AND MARIA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT The storm outside casts a sharp silhouette on the steamy windows. Raindrops patter rhythmically against the glass, complementing the passionate symphony from WITHIN. Ed and Maria’s love overflows; a tangible energy undulates through the air as layers of clothing fall away like petals. Now bare to each other and the world, they find truth in the touch of skin on skin. They sink into the carnal embrace, bodies entwined in the timeless dance of desire. Moonlight streams through the window, casting ghostly rays over their melding forms. A profound intimacy fills the room as a series of delicate moans, and whispers crescendo with the increasing fervor of the night. CUT TO: Adjacent Frame: GRAPHIC DETAILS OMITTED. Passion-filled silhouettes imply their rising desire. CUT TO: The camera pans to the security footage on their laptop, unnoticed in their rapture. The rat, lifeless in its cage, suddenly convulses. Its deceased form twitches, resurrecting into a ghastly vermin gnawing at reality and reason. The rat’s maligned resurrection unfolds clinically, stark against their natural humanity. It begins to batter against the confines of its glass prison with awakened ferocity, signaling the start of a relentless plague. BACK TO ED AND MARIA: Their union, though blurred in the shadows, remains the focal point. But the storm outside picks up its pace, lightning illuminating the backdrop of their passion and the impending dread that brews unseen. CUT TO: Exterior Shot: The rat’s figure, now sinister and frenzied, escapes into the swirling maelstrom, finding its way to the heart of an unsuspecting city. CUT TO: The bedroom builds to a passionate zenith. In the flickering light, two souls entwined seem untouched by the lurking terror. FADE OUT. END OF PAGE 17 OF 150 PAGE 18 OF 150: INT. ED AND MARIA’S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT The tempest outside crescendos, an ominous symphony to match the unfamiliar silence within. Ed and Maria lie entwined, a peaceful reprieve from the chaos of their lives. Yet as they sleep, fate sits patiently on their doorstep. The incessant RINGING of Ed’s phone slices through the silence—insistent, jarring. He stirs, but Maria nudges him towards the persistent invasion of their tranquility. MARIA (muffled against Ed’s neck) Honey… the phone… ED (grumbling) Let it ring… nothing is more important than this moment. But the phone is relentless. After several ignored calls, Ed finally relents. ED (sighing) Alright… alright… He reaches out, voice heavy with the remnants of sleep and satisfaction. ED (into the phone) Hello? The grave voice of a COLLEAGUE reverberates through the line, shattering the mussed warmth of their sanctuary. CUT TO: Split Screen: Ed’s expressions of ecstasy now contort to one of shock and disbelief. COLLEAGUE (V.O.) (urgent, panicked) Ed—it’s gone wrong. The test subject—it… The blood drains from Ed’s face as the screams from the other side sync with lightning strikes outside. Redeployment from a night of union to one of splitting despair. The camera focuses tight on Ed’s widening eyes, as understanding and dread meld into a chilling realization. CUT TO: Maria looks on, her countenance shifting from tranquil contentment to alarmed confusion. MARIA (in a strained whisper) Ed, what’s happened? The storm outside wails as if to answer. Chaos is calling, and their world teeters on the edge of an abyss. SMASH CUT TO BLACK.

A white rat, bearing the hallmark scars of reanimation, escapes through a vent, its eyes baleful, carrying with it the seeds of an unknown horror. BACK TO MARIA AND ED As the storm outside their window rages, a different tempest looms. Ed stands, determination etching his features. He’s no longer just a man but a guardian against the consequences of their hubris. ED (settling into crisis mode) I have to fix this. We have to contain it—before it’s too late. With the storm as their herald, Ed and Maria brace for the dawn of an uncertain future cast under the shadow of their own creation. The screen fades to black, leaving behind an ominous silence.

В этой игре, Эд участвует в гротескном телешоу, созданном человеком по имени Ханз Шоумастер. Шоу называется \\"Rundead\\", где Эд должен пройти через серию зловещих препятствий и испытаний, чтобы в конце концов встретиться с Беном. СЦЕНАРИЙ КОТОРЫЙ Я НАПИСАЛ ОН УЖАСЕН, ПОЭТОМУ ПРИДЕТСЯ ВСЕ СНАЧАЛО СДЕЛАТЬ Сначала фильм лучше начать в мирное время, а потом после это уже разрушительные здания. Например в фильме Эд был ученым в лаборотории. У нее жена тоже ученная. Они вместе с другими ученными поэксперементировали над крысами, чтобы сделать вечную жизнь, и вечную молодость и им это удалось. Они так обрадовались, начали мечтать о будущем, что за это станут выдающимися, популярными людьми, и заработают очень много денег. Они закрыли лабороторию и все пошли по домам ночью. Позже Эд со своей женной на машине приехали домой. Дети находятся у бабушки на пару дней, а родители развлекаются у дома, смотрят фильм, начинают общаться по поводу достижении будущего. Муж в очках начинает флиртовать, разводить ее, она накоонец-то сдается и они начинают заниматься сексом. Вскоре ночью произошло что то нехорошее, крыса умерла, после этого она превратилась в зомби, и каким то образом смогла сбежать с лаборотории. И крыса начинает заражать людей ночью. Родители в очках очень сильно запатели, издают стоны в кровати. Утром в воскресенье встают, идут на работу и они видят что крыса сбежала, не понимают что произошло. В понедельник в школах, в которых они учаться тоже заразились. Их дети пропали без вести, либо заразились. А бабушка заразилась. Родители посмотрели новость в лаборотории о том что начинается заражения в нашем городе. И они видят на улицах толпы зомби, родители переживают о детях, звонят бабушке, но она не принимает трубку, так как она уже заражена. Жена начинает плакать, муж начинает утешать, но лаборотория была почти полностью перекрыта зомбиями, в итоге зомби пробили дверь лаборотории, начинают заражать включая ее жену. Жена не успела принять вакцину, а его муж принял вакцину после того как укусили. Ему не было выхода как прыгнуть в окну, жена сказала живи или типо того, я всегда тебя любила, после это она пожертвовала собой ради его спасения. Он прыгнул в окно с очень высокого этажа, но он выжил, потому что почти полностью эволюционировал в зомби. Мир узнал о вторжении зомби-апокалипсис, начали всемирные переговоры и решили власти мира скинуть ядерную бомбу в город. Как только Эд узнал об этом в новостях, тут же скрылся очень глубоко под землю. В итоге не только все зомби вымерли, но и все люди проживающем в этом городе. Я очень плохо описал часть сюжета для начала так как это было мое виденье, но попробуйте как то преобразовать получше, так чтобы было более детально и просто.

A large window offers a view of the city skyline, twinkling under the mantle of night. MARIA stands by the glass, lost in thought, her silhouette a portrait of contemplation. Her office, usually an epicenter of activity, is now a sanctum of quiet reflection. ED enters, closing the door softly behind him. There’s a magnetism between them as he approaches, the shared burdens and triumphs of their work enveloping them like a cloak. The clink of glass and faint laughter from the celebration seep through the walls, a reminder of the world outside. CUT TO: CLOSE-UP - MARIA’S FACE, illuminated by the city lights, her eyes shining with unshed tears. MARIA (voice soft with emotion) We’ve done more than I ever dreamed. Yet tonight, I can’t shake off a sense of foreboding… ED wraps his arms around her waist, drawing her close. Their connection is as palpable as the air they breathe, their union strengthened by the challenges they’ve faced. ED (reassuringly) We’ve tread through the unknown, shaped the future. Any fear we feel is a reminder of our responsibility. They stand in shared silence, their gaze on the sprawling city below—a testament to humanity’s relentless advance. CUT TO: TWO SHOT - ED AND MARIA together, framed against the cityscape. Ed rests his chin on Maria’s shoulder, their reflections woven into the tapestry of lights. ED (softly) What matters now is that we navigate the path ahead with caution. For every miracle we’ve created, there’s a responsibility we can’t ignore. MARIA (turning to face him) Our dreams could become nightmares if we’re not careful. The joy of discovery, the weight of consequence—we carry them both. ED (nodding) Together, we’ll face whatever comes. Our love, our bond… it’s our anchor amidst the storm. They share a tender kiss, a moment of solace away from prying eyes and probing questions. It’s a promise, a vow unspoken but deeply felt—an acknowledgment of their unity and unwavering support for each other. FADE OUT.

GENEsis LABORATORY - LATE NIGHT The lab, now silent and still, echoes the absence of the day’s fervor. ED and MARIA close down their workstations, their faces a stark contrast of triumph and trepidation. Ed powers off the last computer with a lingering touch, almost reluctant to let go of the day’s events. MARIA (gently) We stand at a crossroads, Ed. Our work has the power to alter the course of humanity. ED (softly) For all the promise it holds, it also carries a shadow of risk. The weight of that is… tremendous. Together, they cast a final look across the lab, a cauldron of potential now whispering with secrets yet to unfold. They exit, locking the secrets within the laboratory walls. EXT. ED AND MARIA’S CAR - NIGHT Under a cloak of stars, the couple drive away, leaving the beacon of GENEsis behind. The car’s interior is a sanctuary of shared silence—a stillness fraught with the unspoken thrill of success and the creeping dread of the unknown. MARIA (eyes on the road) There’s no retreating from the path we’ve taken. ED (firmly) We face whatever comes. With clarity, with unity. Always together. Their hands intertwine, bridging the gap between their quiet anxieties and the fiercely held hope that anchors them. CUT TO: INT. ED AND MARIA’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT The house, a realm separate from scientific breakthroughs and ethical quandaries, welcomes them with gentle shadows and a familiar sense of intimacy. Glasses of wine in hand, they find solace in each other’s company, a bastion against the coming storm. MARIA (soft chuckle) Science aside, I’m grateful for this—this quiet moment with you. It’s the still point in a turning world. ED (eyes meeting hers) Amidst everything, you’re my constant, Maria. The heart of my universe. They drink to that constancy, to the refuge they find when the weight of the world retreats in the face of their love. FADE OUT. END OF PAGE 14 OF 150 PAGE 15 OF 150: INT. ED AND MARIA’S CAR - EVENING Inside the car, the mood is one of celebration and contemplation. They navigate the road, each turn moving them further from the lab—an emblem of their progress—and closer to their sanctuary of normalcy. Laughter and warm exchanges fill the space. ED No prediction could ever account for how today unfolded. We’re pioneers on an uncharted frontier. MARIA (eyes softening) And what we’ve begun… it’s both exhilarating and intimidating. Pulling up in their driveway, they allow a moment for the day’s reality to settle like dusk around them. Exiting the car, they carry with them the gravity of their roles in shaping tomorrow. EXT. ED’S HOUSE - BACK PORCH - LATER The stars adorn the night sky as Ed and Maria, wrapped in each other’s arms, set the bottle of wine down on a side table. The porch is their stage, the cool breeze whispers secrets for the morrow—a moment etched in tranquillity. MARIA (raising her glass) To us, to our dreams, to a future painted with the colors we choose. ED (holding his glass high) A future where every possibility, every hope, is within our reach. Their eyes meet, alight with a love that’s weathered storms and may yet face more. The night envelopes them in gentle reassurance, even as darker currents surge unseen, beyond the edges of their vision. FADE TO BLACK.

ED AND MARIA’S HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT The living room is swathed in soft, warm lighting, casting an intimate glow over ED and MARIA, who sit closely together on the plush sofa, elegantly set with a sleek modern design that contrasts the traditional, romantic atmosphere. In front of them, a low table adorned with a bouquet of fresh flowers and a pair of flickering candles. An unfinished bottle of red wine breathes beside two half-empty glasses. Maria leans into Ed, snuggling under his arm as they reminisce about their day’s success and dream about what the future holds. MARIA (smiling lovingly at Ed) To think… we might have just unlocked the secrets of eternal youth. ED (looking into her eyes) And I couldn’t have done it without you—the brilliant mind and the beating heart of our team. Maria blushes at the compliment, looking down modestly before meeting his gaze again. MARIA (raising her glass) To our discovery, our future… and to us. Ed raises his glass, clinking it gently against Maria’s. They sip the rich wine, a musical choir of distant night sounds serenading them. ED (earnestly) Through every trial, our partnership has only grown stronger. Whatever the future brings, we’ll face it together. The camera slowly zooms in as Ed and Maria gently put their glasses down and turn towards each other. Maria gently frames Ed’s face with her hands and whispers softly. MARIA I feel like this is just the beginning. A new chapter… Ed captures her lips with his, deepening their kiss as gentle music begins to rise.

Ed and Maria’s love overflows; a tangible energy undulates through the air as layers of clothing fall away like petals. Now bare to each other and the world, they find truth in the touch of skin on skin. They sink into the carnal embrace, bodies entwined in the timeless dance of desire. Moonlight streams through the window, casting ghostly rays over their melding forms.

It begins to batter against the confines of its glass prison with awakened ferocity, signaling the start of a relentless plague. BACK TO ED AND MARIA: Their union, though blurred in the shadows, remains the focal point. But the storm outside picks up its pace, lightning illuminating the backdrop of their passion and the impending dread that brews unseen.

The incessant RINGING of Ed’s phone slices through the silence—insistent, jarring. He stirs, but Maria nudges him towards the persistent invasion of their tranquility. MARIA (muffled against Ed’s neck) Honey… the phone… ED (grumbling) Let it ring… nothing is more important than this moment. But the phone is relentless. After several ignored calls, Ed finally relents. ED (sighing) Alright… alright… He reaches out, voice heavy with the remnants of sleep and satisfaction. ED (into the phone) Hello? The grave voice of a COLLEAGUE reverberates through the line, shattering the mussed warmth of their sanctuary.

The two main types of user accounts with regard to privilege levels are standard user accounts and administrator accounts. 1. **Standard User Accounts**: By default, standard users have limited permissions and are unable to make significant changes to the system. This includes installing or uninstalling software, changing system-wide settings, or modifying files in secure system locations. The limitation in permissions is a security measure to prevent accidental or intentional system-wide changes that could affect the stability and security of the system. 2. **Administrator Accounts**: Administrator accounts, on the other hand, have elevated privileges that allow users to perform almost any action on the system, including those that can affect the security and stability of the operating system. Users with administrator privileges can install and remove software, change critical system settings, and access all files on the system. When running applications in Windows, the application may require a certain level of permission to function correctly: - **Standard privileges**: Most applications are designed to run with standard privileges and do not need elevated privileges to perform their tasks. - **Elevated privileges**: Some applications, especially those that perform system-level tasks such as disk management utilities, system monitoring tools, or server software, require elevated privileges to access the resources they need to function properly. If such an application is run without the necessary privileges, it may not work correctly or may be unable to perform some of its functions. The mechanism behind managing these permission levels is known as User Account Control (UAC), which was introduced with Windows Vista. UAC helps prevent unauthorized changes to the operating system. When an application requires elevated privileges, UAC prompts the user for consent—or for administrator credentials on a standard user account—before allowing the application to run with higher privileges. When developers create software for Windows, they can specify the required execution level in the application's manifest file. Here are the execution levels that can be set: - **AsInvoker**: The application will run with the same privileges as the calling process. - **HighestAvailable**: The application will run with the highest privileges available to the current user. - **RequireAdministrator**: The application will always run with administrator privileges, prompting for consent or credentials if necessary. If an application is intended to be run with elevated privileges but is not, it may display errors, fail to execute certain tasks, or crash. Conversely, running an application with elevated privileges unnecessarily can be a security risk, as it could potentially provide a pathway for malicious software to compromise the system. To address an application that's encountering problems due to privilege issues, you can right-click the executable file or shortcut and select \\"Run as administrator\\" to start it with elevated permissions. Alternatively, application compatibility settings can be adjusted to always run the application as an administrator. However, it is important to do this only for trusted applications that genuinely require elevated access to operate correctly."},{"instruction":"when using net.exe use command to map network drives, will the standard user account and admin account make a difference?","output":"Yes, using the \`net use\` command to map network drives as a standard user versus an administrator can make a difference depending on the specifics of the networking setup and the resources you are trying to access. When you map a network drive using a standard user account, you'll only have access to network resources that the account has permission to use. If the network resource requires higher privileges (for example, if you're trying to access administrative shares like C or if the network resource has restricted permissions), then a standard user may not have sufficient rights to successfully map the drive. Here's a simple example of the \`net use\` command: \`\`\`shell net use Z: ServerShare \`\`\` This would map the network share \\"Share\\" on \\"Server\\" to the drive letter Z. If you encounter permission issues, the command may prompt you for a username and password that has sufficient rights to access the share. On the other hand, if you run the \`net use\` command from an administrative account (or elevate your command prompt using \\"Run as administrator\\"), you might have access to additional network resources depending on the administrative account's permissions. However, UAC (User Account Control) may still restrict certain actions unless they are explicitly granted with administrative approval. Here are some key points to consider: - Access to network resources is generally governed by the network permissions and the account you use, not necessarily by whether your local Windows session is under a standard or administrator account. However, being an administrator may allow you to override certain local policies. - When you map a network drive using \`net use\` within a command prompt launched with administrator privileges, the mapped drive is typically not visible in a standard user's Windows Explorer. This is due to the separation of session spaces between standard user contexts and administrator contexts in modern versions of Windows. - If you map the drive as a standard user but need to provide different credentials to access the network resource, you can specify them in the \`net use\` command: \`\`\`shell net use Z: ServerShare /user:DomainUsername Password \`\`\` - Some environments use Group Policy to restrict the ability to map certain network drives to administrators only. To troubleshoot issues with mapping network drives, make sure that the user account has the necessary network permissions, and if you must elevate to an administrator, be aware that the mapping might not persist or be visible across different user contexts."},{"instruction":"if using \\"net use Z: ServerShare /user:DomainUsername Password\\", will Z drive be visible to both standard user and admin?","output":"If you map a network drive using the \`net use\` command with specific credentials while logged in as a standard user, the mapped drive (Z: in your example) will usually only be visible within that standard user's session. If you then switch to an administrator account or open a new session with elevated privileges, the mapped drive will not be visible in the new context. Windows typically isolates drive mappings between user sessions for security and session management purposes. This means that drives mapped within one user's session (whether a standard user or an administrator) are generally not visible to other user sessions. Here’s what to expect in different situations: 1. **Mapped as a Standard User**: If you are logged in as a standard user and map the network drive using a different set of credentials with \`net use\`, the mapped drive will only be visible to your standard user session. It won't appear for an administrator or another standard user unless they map it within their own sessions using the same or another set of credentials. 2. **Mapped with Elevated Privileges**: If you open a command prompt with \\"Run as administrator\\" and map the drive there, it will not appear in a standard user's session, nor will it be visible in a normal command prompt window that is not running with elevated privileges. It will only be visible in the elevated session. 3. **Drive Persistency**: If you use the \`/PERSISTENT:YES\` option with the \`net use\` command, the mapped drive is intended to persist across logins; however, it will still only reappear in the context of the user who created it. Remember that persistency doesn’t change the visibility of the mapped drive between different user contexts. In short, regardless of the credentials used to map the network drive, the visibility of the Z: drive is scoped to the user session executing the \`net use\` command, and it does not cross over between standard user sessions and elevated/administrator sessions. If you need the drive to be available across all sessions or to specific users, you may need to map it separately within each user's context or look into Group Policy settings that can automate network drive mapping for users."},{"instruction":"So i will need to mount twice, one with standard user cmd, one with admin cmd, to make the drive visible to all apps, no matter if they run with or without elevated privilege?","output":"Yes, if you need the network drive to be visible to applications running under both standard and elevated privileges, you would typically have to map the network drive twice: once in a standard user context and once in an elevated context (administrator). This is because, in Windows, the mapped network drives are tied to the specific user logon session - standard and elevated sessions have separate namespaces for network drive mappings due to the User Account Control (UAC) isolation. For standard user applications: - Open a normal command prompt (not as an administrator). - Map the network drive using the \`net use\` command. For applications that require elevated privileges: - Open a command prompt as an administrator (right-click the command prompt and select \\"Run as administrator\\"). - Map the network drive again using the \`net use\` command within this elevated command prompt. This will ensure that the drive mapping is accessible to both types of applications. However, this approach has its drawbacks: - It can be inconvenient to have to map the drive in both contexts. - It might lead to confusion if the mappings use different drive letters or network paths. - The network drive mapped in the elevated context is not typically visible in the Windows Explorer interface accessed by a standard user, which could be inconvenient or confusing for end users. As an alternative to multiple mappings, software solutions exist that can enable the sharing of network drive mappings between user and administrative sessions. In a controlled environment, Group Policy can also be used to roll out consistent drive mappings across all user sessions. Lastly, it's important to note that mapping drives with administrative privileges poses a security risk, as it could inadvertently expose sensitive data or systems to unauthorized access. Always ensure that you map drives with the least privileges necessary for the required task."},{"instruction":"how to set group policy to make the drive visible for all users?","output":"To create a Group Policy Object (GPO) that maps a network drive for all users, regardless of their privilege level, follow these steps: 1. Open the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC): - Press \`Win + R\`, type \`gpmc.msc\`, and hit \`Enter\`. - Alternatively, on a domain controller, you can find it in the \\"Administrative Tools\\" section in the Control Panel or under \\"Windows Administrative Tools\\" in the Start menu. 2. Create a new Group Policy Object or edit an existing one that is linked to the appropriate Organizational Unit (OU) where your user accounts reside. 3. Navigate to \`User Configuration\` -> \`Preferences\` -> \`Windows Settings\` -> \`Drive Maps\`. 4. Right-click on \`Drive Maps\` and select \`New\` -> \`Mapped Drive\`. 5. In the new drive properties window, configure the settings for your mapped drive: - Under the \\"Action\\" dropdown, select \\"Create,\\" \\"Update,\\" or \\"Replace\\" depending on how you want the policy to apply. - In the \\"Location\\" field, enter the path to the network share (e.g., \`ServerSharedFolder\`). - Assign a drive letter from the \\"Drive letter\\" dropdown. - If necessary, check \\"Reconnect\\" to make the mapping persistent across sessions and reboots. - Under the \\"Common\\" tab, you may want to select \\"Run in logged-on user's security context\\" to ensure the drive is mapped with user permissions. - Optionally, you can set up the mapping to use different credentials. However, this is usually avoided in GPOs for security reasons. 6. Click \`OK\` once you've configured the drive mapping settings. 7. Once the GPO is created or edited, it needs to be linked to the appropriate OU, if you haven't already done so. This ensures the policy is applied to the correct users or groups. 8. Allow some time for Group Policy to refresh or force an update on a client by running \`gpupdate /force\` from the command line. Note that the drive mapping policy is applied at user login or Group Policy refresh interval. Network drives mapped via GPO are visible and accessible to the user regardless of whether applications are run with or without elevated privileges since the mappings occur in the user's context thanks to the specific policy configuration. Keep in mind these mapped drives will only be visible within a user session and not across different user profiles. If you need the mapping to be available for all users on a machine, including those with administrative sessions, you might consider using a logon script or a startup script that includes the \`net use\` command, and ensure that it's configured to run in the appropriate security context. However, Group Policy drive mappings are typically user-specific and not system-wide."},{"instruction":"maybe i can create two daemons with different privileges, both monitor the net drive and mount if disconnected","output":"Creating two daemons (services in Windows terminology) that monitor the network drive and remap it if it becomes disconnected is indeed a more advanced solution. This will ensure that the mapped drive is consistently available, regardless of user privilege level changes. Here are the general steps you could follow: 1. **Create a Service Application**: You would need to create an application that attempts to reconnect to the network drive when it detects a disconnection. This application would be run as a Windows service. 2. **Run the Services with Different Privileges**: To ensure that both standard and elevated privilege applications can access the network drive, you would run two instances of this application. One service would run under a standard user account, and the other would run with administrative privileges. Both would need to be configured to restart themselves upon service failure (e.g., after a network interruption). 3. **Configure Service Recovery Options**: Under the service properties in the \\"Recovery\\" tab, you can set the service to take specific actions after subsequent failures, such as restarting. However, before proceeding with such an implementation, consider the following: - **Complexity and Maintenance**: Running custom services adds complexity to the system. You will need to maintain the service application code and ensure its security. - **Security Risks**: Running a service that automatically reconnects to network resources may inadvertently expose you to security risks. Proper handling of credentials and secure programming practices must be followed. - **Synchronization Issues**: If you have two services trying to map the same resource simultaneously but with different user contexts, there is potential for conflict or race conditions, which could lead to mapping failures or unintended behavior. - **User Experience**: Remember that mapped drives by an administrative service won't show up in the standard user's Windows Explorer by default due to session separation, so the user interface experience would need to be considered. - **Built-in Alternatives**: Before developing custom services, it's worth considering whether existing solutions such as scripting (logon scripts), Group Policy Preferences, or scheduled tasks could achieve your goal with less complexity. If the requirement to map the drives for both privilege levels is critical for your use case and cannot be met by existing Windows features like Group Policy Preferences or logon scripts, then writing custom services may be justified. It's typically recommended to explore built-in features and weigh the pros and cons of maintaining custom code, especially for something as critical to security as network drive mapping."},{"instruction":"how to create scheduled tasks to automatically check and mount net drive?","output":"Creating a scheduled task to automatically check and remount a network drive requires creating a batch script to perform the check and map operation, and then using Task Scheduler to run this script at specified intervals.

Below is an example of a simple batch script to achieve this: \`\`\`batch @echo off setlocal :: Define the drive letter and network path set \\"driveLetter=Z:\\" set \\"networkPath=ServerShare\\" :: Check if the drive is already mapped if exist %driveLetter% ( echo Drive %driveLetter% is already mapped. ) else ( echo Drive %driveLetter% is not mapped. echo Attempting to map drive... net use %driveLetter% %networkPath% if %ERRORLEVEL% EQU 0 ( echo Successfully mapped %driveLetter% to %networkPath%. ) else ( echo Failed to map %driveLetter%. Error code: %ERRORLEVEL%. ) ) endlocal \`\`\` Save this script to a file with a \`.bat\` extension, for example \`CheckAndMapDrive.bat\`. # Step 2: Create a Scheduled Task 1. Open Task Scheduler: - You can search for \\"Task Scheduler\\" in the Start menu and open it. 2. Create a New Task: - In the \`Action\` menu, choose \\"Create Task\\" to open the \\"Create Task\\" dialog. 3. Configure General Settings: - Enter a name for the task, for example \\"Check and Map Network Drive\\". - Choose \\"Run whether user is logged on or not\\" if you want it to run regardless of user session. - Choose \\"Run with highest privileges\\" if the share requires administrative rights. 4. Configure Triggers: - Click the \`Triggers\` tab, then click \\"New\\". - Set the task to begin \\"On a schedule\\". - Choose how often you want the check to occur ('Daily', 'Weekly', 'At log on', etc.) - Configure the trigger details (start time, frequency, etc.) and click \\"OK\\". 5. Configure Actions: - Click the \`Actions\` tab, then click \\"New\\". - For \\"Action\\", select \\"Start a program\\". - Browse and select the batch file \`CheckAndMapDrive.bat\` that you created. - Click \\"OK\\". 6. Configure Conditions (optional): - You can specify conditions such as \\"Start the task only if the computer is on AC power\\" or \\"Start only if the following network connection is available\\". 7. Configure Settings (optional): - Adjust the settings to determine the behavior of the task if it fails, if it takes too long, etc. 8. Enter your credentials (if needed): - You will be prompted to enter the credentials for the user account under which the task should run. 9. Save your task: - Click \\"OK\\" to save and exit the setup. Your scheduled task is now set up and should automatically run at the specified times.

Remember to test your task to ensure it works as expected in reestablishing the drive mapping."},{"instruction":"what does setlocal and endlocal mean?","output":"In a batch file script on Windows, \`setlocal\` and \`endlocal\` are commands used to control the visibility of environment variables and their changes within the script. These commands are used to create scopes within the batch file to ensure that any changes made to environment variables are not propagated outside the scope where they were made. Here's a brief explanation of both: - \`setlocal\`: This command begins localization of environment changes in a batch file. After you issue \`setlocal\`, any changes made to environment variables (using the \`set\` command) remain local to the script and are not visible to other batch files or the command prompt shell that executed the script. This way, you can prevent your script's variables from affecting the environment of subsequent scripts or commands. - \`endlocal\`: This command ends the localization of environment changes. When you issue \`endlocal\`, the changes that were made to environment variables within the scope between \`setlocal\` and \`endlocal\` are discarded, and the environment is returned to its previous state before the \`setlocal\` command was run. Essentially, using \`setlocal\` and \`endlocal\` allows you to create a \\"sandbox\\" for your batch file's environment variables. These variables exist temporarily during the execution of the batch file and are cleaned up afterward. Here’s how they work in practice: \`\`\`batch @echo off set VAR1=global echo VAR1 in global scope: %VAR1% setlocal set VAR1=local echo VAR1 in local scope: %VAR1% endlocal echo VAR1 after local scope: %VAR1% \`\`\` In this example: - \`VAR1\` is initially set to \\"global\\" and then displayed. - The \`setlocal\` command creates a new scope. Within this scope, \`VAR1\` is set to \\"local\\" and then displayed. - The \`endlocal\` command ends the scope, and any changes made within it are discarded. - \`VAR1\` is displayed again after the local scope, showing that it has reverted to its global value of \\"global.\\" Using \`setlocal\` and \`endlocal\` is good practice in batch scripting, especially when writing complex scripts that involve multiple environment variables, as it helps to prevent unintentional side effects on the system environment."},{"instruction":"根据中国的命理学知识，给出一名1993年农历三月初十晚上9点出生的男生的命理","output":"在中国传统命理学中，通常用八字（又称为生辰八字或四柱命理）来分析一个人的性格、命运、健康、婚姻、事业等。八字是由出生年月日时的天干地支组成，每个时间单元有两个字符，分别代表天干和地支。 由于您提供的是农历日期，我们首先需要将该日期转换为公历（即阳历或格里历）。1993年农历三月初十晚上9点，可能对应公历的4月或5月（具体日期需要查询该年的农历对照表）。但即使有了确切的公历日期，不同年份的农历三月初十对应的公历日期也可能不同。因此，没有具体的农历转公历日期，我们不能给出准确的八字命理分析。 另外，晚上9点属于中国传统时辰的“戌时”，时辰也是命理分析中重要的因素之一。每个时辰对应一个地支，戌时对应的地支是“戌”。 然而，无精确的公历日期，我们只能提供一个大致框架。在八字中，男生出生于： - 天干：需要根据公历日期确定年柱和月柱的天干 - 地支：需要确定年柱和月柱的地支，而日柱的地支根据农历日期能确定是哪一天，时柱的地支则是“戌” 但是，即使我们知道时辰的地支是“戌”，没有年、月、日的准确干支信息，仍然无法提供完整的八字和命理分析。每个天干地支组合还会与其他部分进行相互作用，形成更复杂的分析体系，包括五行相生相克、十神分析、大运流年等。 若想获取更准确的八字分析，建议您查询农历1993年三月初十对应的公历日期，并提供准确的出生时间（包括时区，因为命理计算基于当地时间），以便进行详尽的分析。在现代，很多在线工具可以帮助进行八字计算和分析。"},{"instruction":"根据中国的命理学知识，给出一名1993年5月1日晚上9点出生的男生的命理","output":"要根据给定的公历日期和时间（1993年5月1日晚上9点）给出一个人的命理分析，首先我们需要换算成中国传统农历日期，并确定天干地支以构建八字。然后我们相应地分析相关的五行、吉凶等因素。我们将这一过程一步步进行。 1. 农历换算： 根据1993年的农历和公历对照表，1993年5月1日晚上9点，农历是三月二十。 2. 八字排盘： 因为不同年份的农历月份会有所变动，需要查证具体的年份才能确定天干地支的排列，以下是根据1993年的情况进行推算。 1993年是公历的辛酉年。我们可以这样排盘： - 年柱（出生年代表的天干地支）：辛酉（辛代表金，酉也属金） - 月柱（出生月份代表的天干地支）：根据中国农历的干支纪年体系和1993年的具体对照，这里是己巳（己属土，巳属火） - 日柱（出生当日代表的天干地支）：需要查询具体的农历日的天干地支，因为没有具体的八字日历，无法提供准确日柱信息 - 时柱（出生时辰代表的天干地支）：晚上9点到晚上11点是戌时（戌属土） 为了得到准确的日柱，我们需要一个万年历来查阅对应日期的天干地支。没有日柱的确切信息，我们的八字分析会不完整。 3. 分析： 假设我们已经有了完整的八字，分析会考虑以下内容： - 五行平衡：分析金木水火土之间的平衡状态，判断哪一类是忌神（不利）或喜神（有利）。 - 大运和流年：计算命局的大运周期和流年影响，预测不同人生阶段可能发生的重大事件。 - 十神分析：用来分析各个天干对本人的具体影响，譬如食神、伤官、比肩等。 - 冲克合害影响：检视八字中的地支相互冲克合害关系，以及天干相生相克的情况。 由于没有日柱的准确信息，以上只是一个大致的分析框架。如果您希望得到详尽的命理分析，可以使用准确的农历出生日期、时间及地点（因考虑到时差问题）查询一个专业的命理咨询或在线八字计算工具。"},{"instruction":"农历日期换算的不对，1993年5月1日换算成农历是闰三月初十","output":"非常感谢您的指正。使用公历1993年5月1日对应的农历日期——闰三月初十，我们可以来尝试进行八字排盘，这里提供一个简化版的分析。 首先，1993年是农历的辛酉年，辛属金，酉为鸡，也属金。根据八字学的传统，我们需要确定该年的干支及时辰。 年柱（出生年代表的天干地支）：辛酉（辛是金，酉也是金） 月柱（出生月份代表的天干地支）：闰三月一般来说，闰月的天干地支与前一个月相同，但是具体需要查询当年历书。大致上，这个时候是春末夏初，那个阶段通常属于巳月（巳属火）。 日柱（出生当日代表的天干地支）：需要具体查询1993年闰三月初十当日的天干地支。 时柱（出生时辰代表的天干地支）：晚上9点到11点是戌时，戌为狗，属土。 具体的日柱，我们需要通过天干地支历书查询得知。但以提供的信息，我们还缺乏足够能够进行命理分析的细节资料，尤其是缺少了日柱的确切信息。 若要得到完整的八字分析，你可能需要咨询专业的命理师，或通过可靠的在线农历转换和八字排盘工具，输入详细的公历出生日期和时辰，以得到更准确的分析。八字分析是相当复杂的，通常需要考虑到五行之间的相生相克、地支之间的冲合害刑及天干之间的相合相生信息。基于你的八字（生辰八字），命理学家会分析你的性格、运势和其他命理相关事项。"},{"instruction":"假设你是一名命理学专家","output":"如果我是一名命理学专家，依据您提供的1993年5月1日晚上9点出生的男生的信息，我们可以根据中国传统命理学进行八字排盘。再次声明，闰三月初十的具体天干地支还需要查阅历书确认，但为了这个假设分析，我会先排出可能的八字，并进行分析。 由于公历1993年5月1日是农历1993年闰三月初十，我们首先需要查找该日的具体天干地支。此处为假设，仅供解释之用。 1. **年柱（辛酉）**：辛属金，酉也属金，这表示该男生的出生年的天干和地支都是金，说明金元素在其八字中可能很旺。 2. **月柱（可能的丙辰）**：在不考虑闰月的情况下，春季晚期大约是辰月，辰为湿土。而闰三月可能的天干为“丙”，这是一个火元素。火能生土，说明火和土这两个元素之间是相生的。 3. **日柱**：我们需要具体的天干地支对照表来确定该日的日柱，因此无法在此假设。 4. **时柱（戌时）**：戌时对应的是戌，属于土。如果我们假设该时辰的天干为“戊”，则戊戌也属土。土在晚上的这个时辰也被认为是较旺盛的状态。 根据这些信息，如果假设的月柱准确，我们可以看到金和土相对旺盛在命盘中。金生水、克木，土生金并克水。因此，金和土的平衡至关重要。 在命理学中，如果某一元素过于强盛，可能导致生命图中的不平衡，这可能在此人的性格和命运中体现出来。例如，金旺的人可能具有刚毅、果断、理性等特点，但也可能表现出刻板、难以妥协的特性。 除此之外，我们还会通过十神来了解命主与周围人的关系，分析五行的旺衰对健康、事业、人际关系等方面的影响，以及通过大运和流年看命主一生的运势走向。 为了进行更为精确的分析，真正的命理学专家需要确切的日柱信息，并详细分析所有的相生相克、冲合害刑等关系才能提供个人的命理指导。如果你对个人的命理分析感兴趣，建议你查找可靠的命理专家或使用详细的历书来获取更为准确的信息。"},{"instruction":"I created an unofficial Jujutsu Kaisen character. Noah Vanderbeek the only son of two special-grade sorcerers, Yuki Tsukumo (She has long blonde hair, she's tall at 187cm, and she possess red eyes.) and a missing Flemish sorcerer named Hannes Vanderbeek, who moved to Japan. His whereabouts, or even if he's still alive, are unknown. (Hannes was around 195cm, or 6'5.) Noah stands at 192cm, though Yuki notes that Hannes did not stop growing until he was 25. He is the second-tallest in the Kyoto School after the 198cm Aoi Todo. Noah is fit with an 8-pack and iliac furrow. His nickname among female students is \\"Beauty and the Beast.\\" His eyes are a rare grey and his thick, long straight hair is a dirty blond, usually styled into a high ponytail. It grows past his shoulder when undone. Noah is a second-year at Kyoto Jujutsu High, and he's regarded with a mix of respect and incredibly high expectations for the accomplishments of his father, and admonishment for the behavior of his mother. Yuki's innate technique (Bonbaye, literally Star Rage) allows her to grant virtual mass to herself and her shikigami, Garuda. The mass greatly enhances Yuki's physical attacks, and allows either her or Garuda to strike with devastating destructive force, capable of effortlessly exorcising a special grade curse. Yuki uses this primarily to punch hard, and the extra mass does not encumber her (Note: up to a certain level, but she has more than enough power.) Noah does seem to be slowed down by the added mass, however, so he struggles to hit as hard as him. Still, he's capable of comfortably carrying 40 times his body weight of 99kg (218lbs.) While a potent power, Bonbaye is only one power. Unique to Noah is Good Vibrations, a jujutsu technique that allows him to create lpowerful shockwaves, seismic disturbances, and even manipulate sound waves all to lay waste to his opponents. The shockwaves, or vibrations, can travel through any medium including the air, water, and the ground. Noah's Good Vibrations technique grants him exceptional control over his own body's vibrations as well. He can vibrate his muscles at high frequencies, enhancing his strength, speed, and reflexes. This ability allows him to move at incredible speeds and deliver lightning-fast strikes, making him a formidable close-combat fighter. Additionally, Noah can absorb and redirect external vibrations, effectively turning any attack against him into an advantage. He can absorb the impact of incoming attacks by harmonizing his own vibrations with them, neutralizing their force and leaving him virtually unharmed. Using this ability, he can also redirect the absorbed vibrations into powerful counterattacks, amplifying their destructive potential. Noah's mastery over vibrations extends beyond combat as well. He can use his ability to detect faint vibrations in his surroundings, allowing him to sense the presence and movements of curses or hidden enemies, or lost allies via echolocation. This enhanced perception makes him an invaluable asset in reconnaissance missions and tracking down elusive targets. The vibrations also stack with Bonbaye. One example of such attack is named \\"Seismic Smash.\\" He focuses vibrations around his fist in a spherical bubble to form an earthquake hypocenter and delivers a punch releasing all the force concentrated at once, with enormous power. A powerful form of this, augmented with virtual mass, is the Nova Smash, individually as strong as an artillery shell, capable of leaving a small crater in the ground and injuring opponents even without direct contact. The most powerful form of Seismic Smash, augmented with the most mass, is Supernova Smash. This is as strong as a missile, requires incantation, and cannot be used willy-nilly. The explosion can pulverize a city block. Another application of his powers is \\"Herstal\\" (from FN Herstal.) in which he fires multiple smaller shockwaves in rapid succession from his fingertips, allowing him concentrated fire. \\"Herstal: Swarm\\" uses ten fingers, allowing for an even greater fire rate. Maximum Herstal is the superlative form. He's a true ace, and Satoru Gojo believes he will surpass him soon, though Gojo teaches for a rival school. Other sorcerers Gojo believes will surpass him, albeit further in the future, include Kinji Hakari and Yuta Okkotsu. Big eater.

His Jujutsu High uniform consists of a a short sleeve jacket (Gakuran) that is always unbuttoned to reveal a black tank, as well as matching pants and dress shoes. Yuki raised him into her idea of a manly man. As a result, he's cut from the same cloth as Aoi Todo. Lo and behold, they were trained by the same person. He has an outrageous personality. He's hot-blooded, passionate in everything he does. He's also temperamental. His birth lead his mother to postpone her research project - she sought to create a world without cursed energy. The plan was for Noah to enroll at Tokyo Metropolitan Curse Technical College (Tokyo Jujutsu High), but he go to Kyoto Metropolitan Curse Technical College (Kyoto Jujutsu High) with his friends instead. Rather than come crawling to another school, she simply chose to leave Jujutsu society again. On the other hand, the meatheaded Todo respects his strength, and Noah is capable of calming him down, though he chooses not to intervene if he thinks it would be more funny otherwise. Relationships: Close friends with Aoi Todo, whom no one else really likes. They're the kind that make fun of each other a lot. They train together, and the surrounding environment often ends up destroyed. Others believe Todo brings out the worst in Noah. Noah's type is a tall woman with long legs. Spirited and strong. He believes these are the most fun to tame. Todo's tastes are similar, tall women with big butts. He's very vocal about this. Kasumi Miwa is one of his best friends, and the two grew up together. She was also his only friend growing up, as the other children were afraid of him. He'd kill those that seek to hurt her. She finds herself intimidated by him nowadays. He's so strong, confident, and he hangs out with that thug! (Todo). Noah is a Grade 1 sorcerer, marking him as part of Jujutsu Society's first line of defense - and also one who walks around with more cash than he uses. Kasumi on the other hand comes from an impoverished family, and wishes to support her two younger brothers. He doesn't \\"do\\" handouts, but he's willing to accompany her on Jujutsu exorcisms. He usually does most of the work. She gets 40%, unless she appeases him with food. In this case, she can get anywhere from a 50-75% cut. Kasumi is a good cook, so it happens more often than you would think. Kasumi serves as a grounding influence, though she struggles with such a stubborn constitution. She understands that Noah sometimes must cut loose to get the excitement out of his system. Kasumi is a user of New Shadow Style: Simple Domain. Simple Domain of course isn't innate and it, as well as the techniques attached to it, can be learned and used by others. She wields a katana in battle. Her innate technique is unnamed but allows her to soothe Noah or others through hugs, massages, or acupuncture needles imbued with her energy. Mai Zen'in is one of many female fans of his, often watching him with hearts in her eyes. Momo Nishimiya believes he should act more mannerly and listen more to his elders, as it would be more \\"cute\\" (Note: like Todo or Noritoshi Kamo, she's a third-year, and she takes this seriously. She believes the young have a duty to obey their elders. She's also a girly girl, and likes \\"cute\\" things and people.) Noritoshi Kamo sees Noah and Todo as lacking the refinement a sorcerer should have. The hot-blooded Noah of course threatens to beat him up, and show him what a real sorcerer is. Kasumi keeps Noah under control, and prevents him from acting impulsively. This might cause wilder characters like Todo, or his admirer in Mai, to chastise her as boring and a killjoy, while the more measured ones may thank her or wonder how she gets him to listen.","output":"With the additional information on Noah Vanderbeek's personality and relationships, it's easier to visualize how he would fit into the dynamic world of \\"Jujutsu Kaisen.\\" His character is defined by his strong presence and interpersonal dynamics, painting a vivid picture of his role in the series. Here's an expansion of his character incorporating the new details: **Expanded Character Profile: Noah Vanderbeek** - **Personality & Attitude:** - Noah has the walk and demeanor of a delinquent, brimming with the defiant confidence of a man raised to be tough and self-assured. - Yuki's influence has sculpted him into someone similar to Aoi Todo, with an outrageous and hot-blooded personality, passionate and occasionally volatile. - **Appearance & Fashion:** - His attire deviates from the norm with an unbuttoned short-sleeve gakuran over a black tank top, signaling his rebellious nature and physicality. - **Schooling & Background:** - Initially meant to join Tokyo Metropolitan Curse Technical College, his decision to attend Kyoto Jujutsu High reflects his strong independent streak and loyalty to friends. - **Interpersonal Relationships:** - Shares an intense but affable bond with Aoi Todo; their camaraderie is marked by mutual teasing and a penchant for training-induced havoc. - Noah's friendship with Kasumi Miwa is long-standing, and she has become an integral part of his life. Despite his reluctance to give handouts, he supports her through shared exorcism jobs, showcasing a softer side willing to negotiate rewards for her cooking—a balance of tough love with genuine care. - Mai Zen'in admires him greatly, while Momo Nishimiya and Noritoshi Kamo find themselves at odds with his demeanor, reflecting the broad spectrum of reactions Noah inspires across his peers. - **Combat Capabilities:** - As a Grade 1 sorcerer, Noah stands at the forefront of the Jujutsu world's defense, exhibiting extraordinary strength and a nuanced understanding of his abilities. - His camaraderie with Todo extends into their shared taste for strong, spirited women, hinting at a competitive yet playful side to his personality. - **Impact on Others:** - Though at times a polarizing figure, especially when it comes to Mai's infatuation or Noritoshi's disapproval, Noah's presence significantly affects those around him. - Kasumi serves as a tempering force for Noah. Despite her struggles, she provides emotional support not only through her culinary skills but also through her unique soothing technique that helps Noah decompress. Interweaving Noah's traits and interactions with established \\"Jujutsu Kaisen\\" characters enriches the complexity of his character and strengthens his believability in the universe. Whether he's training destructively with Todo, advocating for his idea of sorcerers, or navigating the mixed opinions of his peers, Noah's indelible impact resonates throughout the Jujutsu High community. For someone with Noah's personality and abilities, potential story arcs could involve him facing challenges that test his beliefs, working through interpersonal conflicts with characters like Momo and Noritoshi, and maybe exploring deeper storylines with Kasumi, who clearly has a major role in his life. How would Noah's presence change Jujutsu High dynamics? How would he handle situations requiring more than just strength or recklessness? These are interesting angles to explore in his character development."},{"instruction":"A scene and dialogue","output":"Here's a scene featuring Noah Vanderbeek at Kyoto Jujutsu High with his friends Aoi Todo and Kasumi Miwa, along with a brief dialogue exchange that highlights his personality and relationships: --- **Setting**: The sprawling courtyard of Kyoto Jujutsu High, where shattered remnants of cursed energy dummies are strewn about as evidence of intense training. The sun is setting, casting long shadows across the grounds. **Kasumi Miwa** (catching her breath): \\"That's enough for today, Noah! Look at this mess!\\" **Noah Vanderbeek** (grinning, wiping sweat from his brow): \\"What's life without a little chaos, Kasumi? Besides, I'm helping you get stronger!\\" **Aoi Todo** (laughing heartily): \\"Brother, your appetite for destruction is second only to your appetite for Miwa's cooking. Speaking of which, are we getting a taste of that tonight? My muscles cry out for sustenance!\\" Noah (turning to Todo with a fiery look): \\"You'll get your share, Todo, but remember, only if you don't slack during clean-up.\\" **Kasumi** (sighing, knowing the state of the place): \\"Why do I feel like the only grown-up here? Fine, I'll make extra for you two... but only because you'll need the energy to fix what you've broken.\\" Noah flashes a charismatic smile and gently punches Todo on the arm: \\"See, that's what makes her irreplaceable. She keeps us in check.\\" **Momo Nishimiya** (approaching with a stern look): \\"Speaking of being kept in check, would it hurt you to act more...properly, Vanderbeek? Consider showing respect for the school grounds and your seniors.\\" Noah (stepping forward, his grin unfading): \\"Momo, my dear third-year, where's the fun in that? We're sorcerers, not librarians. Besides...\\" He flexes his arm for a bit of bravado. \\"I respect power and heart, and I've got both in spades.\\" **Mai Zen'in** (watching from afar with hearts in her eyes): \\"He's so cool!\\" **Kasumi** (interjecting before Momo can retort): \\"He's just high-spirited, Momo. I assure you, he's well aware of the responsibilities that come with our craft.\\" Noah looks at Kasumi and nods affirmatively, offering her a rare moment of deference out of genuine respect. Noah: \\"She's right. We're all fighting for the same cause, just in our own ways. So, how about we start by turning this place back to normal?\\" With a shared sense of purpose, albeit with different attitudes, the group sets to work, restoring order to the chaos that is both their training and their lives at Kyoto Jujutsu High. --- This scene highlights Noah's competitive yet caring nature, his relationships with Todo and Kasumi, and his interactions with others who are part of his daily life. It also captures the way his personality rubs off on both friends and critics within the Jujutsu society, adding to the richness of his character."},{"instruction":"3DMM是什么","output":"3DMM全称为3D Morphable Model，是一种三维的可变形模型，通常用于数字人脸建模和动画领域。该模型首次由Volker Blanz和Thomas Vetter在1999年提出，目的是为了精确地捕捉和表现人脸的三维结构以及表面的反射特性。 3DMM基于高精度的3D扫描数据来形成一个统计模型，它包含了形状和纹理两个方面。形状模型捕捉了人脸的几何特征，例如面部的轮廓、鼻子、嘴巴和眼睛的位置等；而纹理模型则涉及到肤色、皮肤纹理等表面属性。通过对这些数据进行主成分分析（PCA），3DMM可以生成具有不同形状和纹理特性的新面孔，用于描述或重建真实或虚构的人脸。 在实际应用中，3DMM可以用于不同领域，例如计算机图形学、计算机视觉、医学成像、虚拟现实（VR）、增强现实（AR）和面部识别技术等。通过调整模型参数，研究者和开发人员可以生成一系列多样化的人脸样本，以适配不同的用途和需求。"},{"instruction":"width not divisible by 2 (197x259) ffmpeg图片合成视频时报了这个错误应该怎么解决","output":"在使用FFmpeg将图片合成视频时，如果遇到“width not divisible by 2”这样的错误，意味着你的图片宽度或高度不是2的倍数。许多视频编码标准（比如H.264）要求图像的尺寸必须是2的倍数，这样才能确保编码过程中的像素块能够正确对齐。 为了解决这个问题，你可以通过以下两种方法之一来调整图片尺寸，使其满足编码要求： 1. 使用FFmpeg的scale滤镜来调整图片尺寸。例如，如果你想要把图像的宽度调整为偶数，可以使用如下命令： \`\`\`bash ffmpeg -i input.jpg -vf \\"scale='if(gt(a,1),ceil(iw/2)*2,trunc(oh*a/2)*2)':-1\\" output.jpg \`\`\` 这段代码的含义是如果图像的宽高比大于1，那么就向上取到最近的偶数宽度，高度会自动调整以保持图像的纵横比。 或者，直接指定一个固定的尺寸，例如下面的命令会将图片调整到最接近的偶数尺寸，同时保持纵横比： \`\`\`bash ffmpeg -i input.jpg -vf \\"scale=ceil(iw/2)*2:ceil(ih/2)*2\\" output.jpg \`\`\` 2. 使用其他图像处理软件（如 Photoshop, GIMP, Paint.NET 等）手动调整图片尺寸，确保它们的宽度和高度均为偶数。 选择适合你的方法来调整所有用于合成视频的图片尺寸，以确保宽度和高度均为偶数。之后就可以使用FFmpeg正常进行图片到视频的转换流程了。"},{"instruction":"./ffmpeg -framerate 25 -pattern_type glob -i 'vis2/xiaohongshu_1/0/*.jpg' -vf \\"scale='if(gt(a,1),ceil(iw/2)2,trunc(oha/2)*2)':-1\\" -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p 001.mp4这样写有什么问题么","output":"在您提供的FFmpeg命令中，存在一些需要修正的地方。下面是您的原始命令： \`\`\`bash ./ffmpeg -framerate 25 -pattern_type glob -i 'vis2/xiaohongshu_1/0/*.jpg' -vf \\"scale='if(gt(a,1),ceil(iw/2)2,trunc(oha/2)*2)':-1\\" -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p 001.mp4 \`\`\` 问题和建议如下： 1. 设置尺寸变量时，\`ceil(iw/2)2\`中缺少了操作符\`*\`，导致表达式不能正确执行。同理，\`trunc(oha/2)*2\`这里也有相同的问题，实际上应为\`trunc(oh*a/2)*2\`。要保证每个计算的操作符如\`*\`都写在正确的位置。 2. 在\`scale\`滤镜中，如果要维持宽高比，可以使用\`-1\`来自动计算另一边，但这样有时也会导致非偶数的结果。可以结合\`scale\`滤镜中的\`ih\`使用\`ceil(ih/2)*2\`来保证高度也是偶数。 考虑到上述问题，修正后的命令如下： \`\`\`bash ./ffmpeg -framerate 25 -pattern_type glob -i 'vis2/xiaohongshu_1/0/*.jpg' -vf \\"scale='if(gt(a,1),ceil(iw/2)*2,trunc(oh*a/2)*2)':-2\\" -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p 001.mp4 \`\`\` 在这个修改后的命令中，我使用了\`ceil(iw/2)*2\`来确保宽度是偶数，同时用\`-2\`来自动计算高度并确保它也是偶数。 如果您仍然遇到问题，可以详细描述错误信息，以便能够进一步诊断和解决问题。"},{"instruction":"Missing ')' or too many args in 'if(gt(a,1),ceil(iw/2)2,trunc(oha/2)*2)' 报了这个错","output":"错误提示表明在\`scale\`过滤器中的表达式缺少关闭的括号\`')'\`或者参数过多。在您提供的表达式中确实有些问题，主要是缺失了操作符以及误写的字符。 改正后的命令如下： \`\`\`bash ./ffmpeg -framerate 25 -pattern_type glob -i 'vis2/xiaohongshu_1/0/*.jpg' -vf \\"scale='if(gt(a,1),ceil(iw/2)*2,trunc(oh*a/2)*2)'\\" -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p 001.mp4 \`\`\` 这里我把\`ceil(iw/2)2\`改为\`ceil(iw/2)*2\`，代表把宽度调整到最近的偶数，并确保宽度和高度都符合编码要求。同时我也修正了\`trunc(oha/2)*2\`为\`trunc(oh*a/2)*2\`。注意过滤器参数的结束采用单引号\`'\`闭合。 由于在\`scale\`过滤器中，提供\`-2\`给高度即可保证高度自动取偶数，因此您也可以简化命令如下： \`\`\`bash ./ffmpeg -framerate 25 -pattern_type glob -i 'vis2/xiaohongshu_1/0/*.jpg' -vf \\"scale=ceil(iw/2)*2:-2\\" -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p 001.mp4 \`\`\` 这个命令会保证输出视频中的宽度和高度都是偶数，宽度通过\`ceil(iw/2)*2\`调整到最近的偶数，高度采用\`-2\`来保证自动计算后也为一个偶数值。这样的命令是简洁且有效的，也能满足大多数视频编码标准。"},{"instruction":"有么有什么格式是不要求长宽一定要偶数的","output":"大多数现代视频编码标准，如H.264或H.265(HEVC)，通常要求视频帧的尺寸为偶数，主要是为了编码过程中宏块的处理（宏块通常是8x8像素或者16x16像素）。然而，有些格式或编解码器可能没有这样的限制，允许奇数尺寸的视频。 1. **MJPEG**：即运动JPEG，是一种连续JPEG图片的序列，通常不强制要求图像尺寸必须是偶数。 2. **动画GIF**：虽然不是真正的视频格式，但是动画GIF并不要求宽度和高度必须是偶数。 3. **某些容器格式**：一些容器格式（例如AVI或QuickTime）可能会使用不要求偶数尺寸的编解码器，但这取决于选择的具体编解码器。 重要的是要注意，不是文件的容器格式决定这个要求，而是实际用于视频数据编码的编解码器。尽管有些编解码器允许非偶数尺寸，但出于兼容性、效率和压缩比的考虑，仍然推荐使用偶数尺寸。 如果你不希望调整视频尺寸，一个可行的解决方案是选择支持非偶数尺寸视频的编解码器，但要确保最终用途的播放环境能够支持这样的视频文件。如果你的应用场景允许或不受限于特定的编解码器要求，那么可以选择较为灵活的编解码器。不过，由于偶数尺寸是通用标准，能保证更广泛的兼容性，通常还是建议调整图像尺寸以满足偶数约束。"},{"instruction":"用MJPEG合成视频的命令呢","output":"要使用FFmpeg将一系列JPEG图片合成为一个MJPEG编码的视频，你可以使用类似于以下的FFmpeg命令： \`\`\`bash ./ffmpeg -framerate 25 -i input_%03d.jpg -c:v mjpeg -q:v 3 output.avi \`\`\` 这里是命令中的参数解释： -

The code you've provided essentially sorts the starts and ends depending on the strand, retrieves sequences for each start-end pair, and then concatenates the sequences into a single string. To do this, you'll also need to define \`seq\` as a \`String\` to hold the resulting concatenated sequence.

The call to \`get_sequence(...)\` could potentially fail, so using \`unwrap()\` might not be safe in production code. You would normally want to handle errors gracefully. 2. Sorting \`starts\` and \`ends\` in reverse for the negative strand is correct when you want to get sequences in their natural order, but keep in mind that you may want to reverse-complement each sequence part before concatenating it to get the actual biological sequence consistent with the negative strand. 3. You should consider storing \`seq\` in a more durable way if you need access to it after the loop. The example provided comments out a potential way to update the transcript entry with the sequence. 4. Lastly, ensure that \`records\` is mutable and accessible in the scope where you are using \`get_sequence\`, as the function's signature in the example implies mutability of \`records\`.

It should only read shared data or work with data passed to it. If \`get_sequence\` is part of a structure that needs to access some mutable state, you'll need a synchronized access pattern (like using Mutex or RwLock). - If you're modifying parts of entries in a hashmap in parallel, make sure that no two threads can modify the same entry at the same time, to avoid data races. - Depending on the implementation of \`get_sequence\`, this task can be CPU-bound (due to sorting and computation) or IO-bound (if \`get_sequence\` involves accessing files or databases). This will affect the degree of parallelism you can achieve. If \`get_sequence\` cannot be made thread-safe or requires mutable access to a shared resource, you’ll have to redesign the data flow to ensure thread safety, possibly by handling sequencing in a separate pass or using a concurrent data structure."},{"instruction":"transcripts .par_iter_mut() .for_each(|(transcript, (chr, strand, starts, ends))| { if !transcript.is_empty() { let mut seq = String::new(); match strand.as_str() { \\"+\\" => { starts.sort_unstable(); ends.sort_unstable(); for (i, &start) in starts.iter().enumerate() { let end = ends[i]; if let Some(part) = get_sequence(&mut seqs, chr, start, end, strand) { seq.push_str(&String::from_utf8(part).unwrap()); } } } \\"-\\" => { starts.sort_unstable_by(|a, b| b.cmp(a)); ends.sort_unstable_by(|a, b| b.cmp(a)); for (i, &start) in starts.iter().enumerate() { let end = ends[i]; if let Some(part) = get_sequence(&mut seqs, chr, start, end, strand) { seq.push_str(&String::from_utf8(part).unwrap()); } } } _ => (), } } }); where: fn get_sequence( records: &Vec<seq_io::fasta::OwnedRecord>, chr: &str, start: u32, end: u32, strand: &String, ) -> Option<Vec<u8>> { let mut seq = vec![]; let start = start - 1; for record in records { //let head = String::from_utf8(record.head.to_vec()).unwrap(); let x = record.head.split(|&b| b == b' ').next().unwrap().to_vec(); let head = String::from_utf8(x).unwrap(); if head.contains(chr) { seq = record.seq[start as usize..end as usize].to_vec(); if strand.contains(\\"-\\") { seq.reverse(); seq = b_cpm(seq); } return Some(seq); } } return Some(seq); } and: let mut seqs = Fasta::read(&args.fasta).unwrap().records; error[E0596]: cannot borrow \`seqs\` as mutable, as it is a captured variable in a \`Fn\` closure --> src/main.rs:127:62 | 127 | ... if let Some(part) = get_sequence(&mut seqs, chr, start, end, strand) { | ^^^^^^^^^ cannot borrow as mutable error[E0596]: cannot borrow \`seqs\` as mutable, as it is a captured variable in a \`Fn\` closure --> src/main.rs:138:62 | 138 | ... if let Some(part) = get_sequence(&mut seqs, chr, start, end, strand) { | ^^^^^^^^^ cannot borrow as mutable","output":"The error you're encountering indicates that you're trying to borrow \`seqs\` mutably within a closure that is dictated by \`Fn\` trait bounds, which only allows immutable borrows.

The updated \`get_sequence\` would look like this: \`\`\`rust fn get_sequence( records: &[seq_io::fasta::OwnedRecord], chr: &str, start: u32, end: u32, strand: &str, ) -> Option<Vec<u8>> { // Function body as before... } \`\`\` Here, \`records\` parameter type is changed from \`&Vec<...>\` to a slice \`&[...]\`, which is more idiomatic. Also, notice \`strand\` is now \`&str\` instead of \`&String\`, as it doesn't need ownership. Now, the code calling \`get_sequence\` should look like this: \`\`\`rust transcripts.par_iter_mut().for_each(|(transcript, (chr, strand, starts, ends))| { // Your parallel code... // Now \`seqs\` is borrowed immutably. if let Some(part) = get_sequence(&seqs, chr, start, end, &strand) { // ... } // ... }); \`\`\` Make sure \`seqs\` is not being modified anywhere in the process while being accessed by possibly multiple threads, and that concurrent access is safe. If \`seqs\` is already immutable, then you should not encounter any issues here. Additionally, if the function \`get_sequence\` modifies global state or performs I/O operations, you need to ensure thread safety by other means, like using a mutex to synchronize access to the shared resource. However, based on the context provided, it seems that the function is merely reading data and not modifying it, so you should be fine with these changes."},{"instruction":"is it possible to write to an output inside that block? For example: writeln!(..., transcript, seq).unwrap()","output":"Writing output within a parallel block is possible, but it requires careful coordination to ensure that the output operation is thread-safe. Rust's file I/O operations are not inherently thread-safe when writing to the same file from multiple threads concurrently, as there could be data races which would lead to corrupted output. To handle this issue, you can use synchronization primitives such as \`Mutex\` or \`RwLock\` from the \`std::sync\` module to achieve thread-safe writing. A common pattern is to use a \`Mutex\` to wrap the output writer so that only one thread can write to the file at a time. Here's an example of how you can write output within the parallel block using a \`Mutex\` to wrap an \`io::Write\` object (like a file or standard output): \`\`\`rust use rayon::prelude::*; use std::fs::File; use std::io::{self, BufWriter, Write}; use std::sync::Mutex; // ... // Create an output file for writing. let output_file = File::create(\\"output.txt\\").unwrap(); let writer = BufWriter::new(output_file); let writer_mutex = Mutex::new(writer); transcripts.par_iter().for_each(|(transcript, (chr, strand, starts, ends))| { let mut seq = String::new(); // Compute sequence as before. // Ensure only one thread writes to the file at a time. let mut writer = writer_mutex.lock().unwrap(); writeln!(writer, \\"{}t{}\\", transcript, seq).unwrap(); // MutexGuard is automatically dropped here, releasing the lock. }); // After this point, \`writer_mutex\` goes out of scope // and the underlying writer will be dropped, closing the file. \`\`\` The above code will create an output buffer \`writer\` and wrap it with a \`Mutex\` to guard concurrent access. Inside the \`.par_iter()\` call, each thread computes the sequence string, then it locks the \`Mutex\`, writes to the file, and finally releases the lock as soon as the \`MutexGuard\` is dropped at the end of the lock scope. Note that frequent locking and unlocking can impede parallel performance due to contention. To minimize this, minimize the amount of work done while holding the lock. If the sequences are very large and the computation time to create them is significant compared to the time spent writing, the locking overhead will be less noticeable. If you're worried about performance impact due to synchronization, another approach could be to aggregate the output in memory and write to the file in a single operation after the parallel computation, but this may consume a lot of memory depending on the size of the data. Be careful with error handling as well. In production code, you would want to handle potential errors from \`writeln!\` rather than unwrapping them as this example shows. You may want to collect errors and handle them after the parallel processing is complete."},{"instruction":"how would you optimize this: for (transcript, (chr, strand, mut starts, mut ends)) in transcripts { if !transcript.is_empty() { let mut seq = String::new(); match strand.as_str() { \\"+\\" => { starts.sort_unstable(); ends.sort_unstable(); for (i, &start) in starts.iter().enumerate() { let end = ends[i]; if let Some(part) = get_sequence(&seqs, &chr, start, end, &strand) { seq.push_str(&String::from_utf8(part).unwrap()); } } writeln!(output, \\">{}n{}\\", transcript, seq).unwrap(); } \\"-\\" => { starts.sort_unstable_by(|a, b| b.cmp(a)); ends.sort_unstable_by(|a, b| b.cmp(a)); for (i, &start) in starts.iter().enumerate() { let end = ends[i]; if let Some(part) = get_sequence(&seqs, &chr, start, end, &strand) { seq.push_str(&String::from_utf8(part).unwrap()); } } writeln!(output, \\">{}n{}\\", transcript, seq).unwrap(); } _ => (), } } } needs to be the fastest way possible","output":"To optimize the code for performance, consider the following strategies: 1. Use parallel processing: Since the processing of each transcript is independent of the others, this operation is a good candidate for parallelization. Rayon can be used to handle this. 2. Reduce allocation and copying: String allocation and copying can be expensive, so it's better to allocate once and reuse the buffer. Additionally, if the sequences are large, consider using a more efficient data structure, such as a \`Vec<u8>\`, to avoid the cost of UTF-8 validation when converting from \`Vec<u8>\` to \`String\`. 3. Avoid sorting if unnecessary: If the \`starts\` and \`ends\` vectors are guaranteed to be in order, remove the sorting step. If this guarantee cannot be made but the data is mostly sorted, consider using \`sort_unstable\` only if the vectors are not already sorted. 4. Improve I/O efficiency: Use buffered I/O and write to the file in chunks to minimize system calls. Ensure that you're not holding a lock on the output longer than necessary when doing parallel writes. 5. Error handling: Use proper error handling instead of \`unwrap()\` to avoid panics in case of errors. Here's an example with some of these suggestions incorporated and assuming parallel processing is desired: \`\`\`rust use rayon::prelude::*; use std::sync::Mutex; use std::fs::File; use std::io::{BufWriter, Write}; // Assuming you have a \`get_sequence\` function and \`seqs\` data. // ... // Create a buffered output writer wrapped in a Mutex for thread safety. let output_file = File::create(\\"output.fasta\\").unwrap(); let writer = BufWriter::new(output_file); let writer_mutex = Mutex::new(writer); // Use Rayon to parallelize the work. transcripts.par_iter().for_each(|(transcript, (chr, strand, starts, ends))| { if !transcript.is_empty() { let mut seq = Vec::new(); // Check if sorting is necessary let mut starts_sorted = starts.clone(); let mut ends_sorted = ends.clone(); if strand == \\"+\\" { starts_sorted.sort_unstable(); ends_sorted.sort_unstable(); } else if strand == \\"-\\" { starts_sorted.sort_unstable_by(|a, b| b.cmp(a)); ends_sorted.sort_unstable_by(|a, b| b.cmp(a)); } // Get the sequence for (&start, &end) in starts_sorted.iter().zip(ends_sorted.iter()) { if let Some(mut part) = get_sequence(&seqs, &chr, start, end, &strand) { // You could handle the '-' strand complement here if needed. seq.append(&mut part); } } // Avoid locking until the sequence is fully built. let mut output = writer_mutex.lock().unwrap(); writeln!(output, \\">{}\\", transcript).unwrap(); output.write_all(&seq).unwrap(); // Writes Vec<u8> directly writeln!(output).unwrap(); // Adds newline after the sequence } }); \`\`\` In this version, the code is run in parallel using Rayon, and the file writing is safeguarded by a \`Mutex\` to avoid write conflicts. A \`Vec<u8>\` is used for the sequence data to avoid the cost of repeated \`String\` allocations. Error checking is omitted for simplicity but should be included in production code. Remember that writing to a single output file from multiple threads could still become a bottleneck. If each transcript results in a large amount of data being written, and this write operation is a significant part of the total computation time, then the mutex lock could become a point of contention. In such cases, consider writing to separate files in each thread and combining them later, or using a concurrent data structure to collect the results and write them out after the parallel computation."},{"instruction":"so I wanna loop through all the returns from the product call and add all in together and render them at weight ins, and same for out, also wanna sort based on month and

Это может касаться множества различных областей, включая механику, физику, робототехнику и даже программирование. Чтобы обеспечить точность ответа, я ограничу объяснение различными возможными сценариями: 1. **Физика**: В физике условие остановки может быть связано с критериями, приводящими к прекращению вращения объекта. Это может включать в себя: - Выработку кинетической энергии из-за трения. - Действие внешних сил, таких как тормозные силы, которые противодействуют вращению. - Достижение определенного углового положения, если объект подвергается контролируемому вращению (например, в робототехнике). 2. **Робототехника**: В робототехнике условие остановки может быть частью программы управления движением, которая останавливает моторы или активаторы, когда достигнуто определенное условие. Например, если робот должен повернуться на определенный угол, датчик угла может сигнализировать о достижении необходимого положения, что станет условием остановки. 3. **Теория устойчивости**: В контексте теории устойчивости систем, условие остановки может относиться к параметрам системы, при которых вращение перестает быть устойчивым, и объект приходит в состояние покоя или переходит в другой режим движения. 4. **Программирование**: При моделировании вращательной динамики в программировании можно задать условие остановки в итерационном цикле, который вычисляет состояния вращающегося объекта. Как только достигнут нужный критерий – например, угол поворота, время вращения или уровень энергии – цикл прекращается. Для получения более конкретной информации необходимо знать контекст вопроса, поскольку \\"условие остановки\\" может интерпретироваться по-разному в зависимости от области и специфики применения."},{"instruction":"translate to english","output":"I would be happy to help with the translation, but it seems you did not include any text for me to translate.

It wasn't a reckless charge. He moved into the blind spot that wasn't visible from the player's field of view. Of course, the opposing player turned his head to check his surroundings. But every time he did, Shin Jaewook slightly changed his position and disappeared from the player's sight. Then, a Qatari player shouted. \\"Pressure from behind! Be careful!\\" It was a shout to alert that Shin Jaewook was approaching from the blind spot. However, it was already too late for the Qatari player to respond to the warning. Shin Jaewook wasn't just pressuring; he had already executed a quick sliding tackle. Swoosh! It was a sliding tackle coming from an unseen angle, aimed precisely at the ball. The Qatari player instinctively moved to protect the ball. But at that moment, Shin Jaewook controlled the tip of his foot and pulled the ball towards him. Whisk! Lying on the grass, Shin Jaewook quickly got up while pulling the ball with him. At that moment, he saw it. Lee Taekhyun was ready to receive the ball in a good position. 'Nicely done.' It's not easy to make soccer this comfortable for someone. You have to be quick-witted and physically strong. And you have to trust your teammates. \\"As expected, Jaewook! I knew you'd take it!\\" Lee Taekhyun had done it. Thump! Shin Jaewook immediately passed the ball. At the same time, he moved to a better position. — Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun are in sync! This is exciting! When these two players come together, great moments often happen, right? — Yes! Shin Jaewook passes the ball to Lee Taekhyun and runs! Shin Jaewook received the rolling ball with the inside of his foot. It was a return pass from Lee Taekhyun. Since he caught the ball in a better position, the pressure on Shin Jaewook was less intense. So he shouted. \\"I'll carry it further! Everyone, move!\\" The response came immediately. \\"Okay!\\" \\"Got it, Jaewook!\\" \\"I'm moving!\\" These were the responses from his national team colleagues. They all firmly believed in Shin Jaewook, which was evident in their actions. 'They respond really well.' Shin Jaewook smiled and moved forward. He dribbled forward, checking the view ahead. Then he quickly checked to the right, left, and behind. At that moment, a Qatari player lunged at him. He tried to collide with Shin Jaewook to hinder his advance, but his intention failed. Shin Jaewook's ability to evade pressure was too superior. — Shin Jaewook's evasion! Amazing! He easily escaped the pressure with precise feinting! Having escaped the pressure, Shin Jaewook didn't get greedy. He saw his teammates in better positions. 'Passing is better now.' Among them, Lee Taekhyun was showing the best movement. He was complicating the minds of the Qatari defenders by playing on the offside line. However, Shin Jaewook had no intention of passing to Lee Taekhyun. Passing to a teammate who was drawing the defenders' attention could risk losing the ball. It was better to pass to a teammate outside the defenders' line of sight. Thud! Shin Jaewook's kicked ball rolled low. It was a pass aimed at Son Hoonmin, who was standing at the left corner of the penalty box, away from the defenders drawn to Lee Taekhyun. Tap! Son Hoonmin received the ball with a poor first touch. It would have been better to control the ball close to his body, but unfortunately, he didn't manage to do so. But his next move was good. He immediately took a shot. A curling shot aimed at the opposite corner of the goal. It was one of the most powerful weapons possessed by Son Hoonmin, a promising player active in the Bundesliga. — Son Hoonmin! He shoots! — Wow! It's in! Goooooal! A fantastic goal by Son Hoonmin! It was a goal. Son Hoonmin had intended to shoot, and it connected perfectly. The Qatari goalkeeper couldn't even react. \\"Yaaaaa!\\" Son Hoonmin shouted as he slid on the grass in celebration. At that moment, a tremendous cheer erupted. Wow! — The cheers are incredible! The shouts from the Korean fans fill the stadium! And the Korean national team players piled on top of Son Hoonmin, who was performing a sliding celebration. \\"Hahaha! Hoonmin! That was an awesome shot! Congratulations on the goal, man!\\" \\"Amazing! So cool! Hoonmin, you really scored a great goal!\\" \\"Goal! Congratulations! We can't lose this game!\\" \\"Nice goal!\\" Shin Jaewook didn't throw himself at Son Hoonmin like the other teammates. After the celebration ended, he personally congratulated Son Hoonmin. \\"Congratulations. It was a great goal.\\" \\"Oh! Jaewook! Thanks for the pass! You and Taekhyun drew all the defenders' attention, so I could score comfortably.\\" \\"It was a good shot by you.\\" \\"No, it was because there was no pressure, so I had to shoot well. I even made a mistake with my first touch.\\" \\"Didn't you intentionally make a long touch to create a shooting angle?\\" \\"What? Hahaha! You speak so nicely. I wish that was the case, but unfortunately, it was just a mistake. Still, I'm glad it led to a goal.\\" \\"Congratulations.\\" After the conversation with Son Hoonmin, Shin Jaewook checked his own condition.

It was natural for the growth of his abilities to slow down, but he was pleased that his physicality had increased today. Additionally, based on his experience, there was a possibility that the Ground Fighter (C) trait could grow. 'If I can grow the trait, I'll have gained everything from this game.' Shin Jaewook smiled. After closing the status window, he looked at the opposing players. The Qatari players, unlike in the first half, now looked desperate. Even now, they were begging the referee to quickly end the Korean celebration. Seeing this, Shin Jaewook couldn't help but laugh at their absurdity. \\"Those guys are really funny. They stall when they want to, and now they switch tactics like that.\\" --- After the score became 3 to 1. The Qatari players developed their attacks very urgently. They had become a completely different team from the first half. Moreover, their attacks were quite sharp, threatening enough for the Korean defenders. However, the more they focused on the attack, the more vulnerable they became to counterattacks. Qatar continued to be shaken by Korea's counterattacks. It was the same now. — Ki Seok-yong intercepts! Good defense! This could be a counterattack chance, right? Ki Seok-yong immediately connects to Gu Ja-cheon! Gu Ja-cheon, true to his reputation as a player with decent passing skills, quickly connected a precise pass to Lee Taekhyun, who was sprinting forward. — Great pass! Lee Taekhyun receives the ball! Ah~! He's really fast! Lee Taekhyun sprinted explosively. Even while controlling the ball, he showed a faster speed than the Qatari players chasing him from behind. The distance to the goal closed in an instant. — It's a one-on-one chance with the goalkeeper! Lee Taekhyun! Will he shoot? Lee Taekhyun didn't hesitate to shoot. It was a shot filled with confidence that he could win the one-on-one with the goalkeeper. However. Boom! The Qatari goalkeeper blocked the shot. It was an amazing save. But at that moment. \\"Damn it!\\" The Qatari goalkeeper's face contorted after making the super save. Even though he made the save, he couldn't be happy at all. The ball he deflected was heading towards Shin Jaewook, the Korean striker who had followed up late. Shin Jaewook calmly touched the ball and then took a composed shot. \\"Why does the ball have to go to that guy!\\" The Qatari goalkeeper didn't know. Shin Jaewook had been 'prepared' for this situation, considering even such a scenario. 'A striker should always be ready to score in any situation.' He was a striker known for his excellent positioning before his reincarnation. — Goooooal! It's Shin Jaewook! Lee Taekhyun's shot was blocked by the goalkeeper, but Shin Jaewook managed to score a goal! — Shin Jaewook is really... always ready to score in any situation! This is what a real striker is like! It's so reassuring to have such a player on the same team! The current score was 4 to 1. It was a significant lead. But the Korean goal fest was not over yet. — Goal! It's Shin Jaewook again! Shin Jaewook scores a hat-trick! Wow! Again, it was a combination with Lee Taekhyun, right? Their movement of passing the ball to each other is so good! They easily shake off the Qatari defenders in tight spaces and create goals! — The class is different! These players, Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun, seem to be on a level that the Qatari defenders can't handle! — With Shin Jaewook's hat-trick, the score is now 5 to 1! In the 35th minute of the second half, Shin Jaewook's third goal was scored. — Wow! Lee Taekhyun scores with a chip shot over the goalkeeper! It was a really calm shot! — Lee Taekhyun! Despite playing as a winger in the Bundesliga, he has excellent scoring ability, right? Today, he's showing his skills properly for the Korean national team! In the 42nd minute, Lee Taekhyun's second goal was scored. With the continuous goal fest, the Korean fans supporting the team couldn't help but be overjoyed. └ Crazyㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ It's really a goal festㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ To crush Qatar like this? When did Korean soccer become so strong?ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ The offensive power changed after Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun joinedㄷㄷㄷ And it got stronger in the midfield. └ The midfield battle got stronger thanks to Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun. They came down and unraveled the game. └ The person above knows soccer. Just having two players of a different class join and play makes the team look much stronger. Look at the Qatari defenders. They can stop other players, but they can't stop Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun. It's just a different class. └ It's so refreshing to see so many goalsㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ I was so pissed off because of Qatar's defensive soccer in the first halfㅋㅋㅋ While the Korean fans were ecstatic. Qatar lost their confidence. The score was too daunting to catch up with. Perhaps that's why? No additional goals were scored by Qatar until the end of the match. Whistle! The game ended. The final score was 6 to 1. And now. Shin Jaewook, who had recorded 3 goals and 2 assists, showing the best performance on the team, was... \\"Wow...!\\" He was surprised. An unexpected trait had grown."},{"instruction":"166 * * * U―20 월드컵이 끝난 이후. 신재욱은 한 달이라는 긴 시간 동안 휴식을 취했다. 훈련에 참여하긴 했지만, 최대한 낮은 강도로만 진행하며 체력과 컨디션 회복에 집중했다. 그 과정에서 신재욱은 S급 특성인 ‘극도의 볼 컨트롤’의 효과도 완벽하게 확인했다. [극도의 볼 컨트롤] [등급] S [효과] 공을 대단히 잘 다룰 수 있게 되고, 드리블과 탈압박이 굉장히 편해집니다. 또한, 볼 트래핑과 개인기도 매우 좋아집니다. 공을 다루는 능력, 드리블과 탈압박, 볼 트래핑과 개인기가 전부 좋아지는 사기적인 특성. 효과는 당연히 대단했다. “‘극도의 볼 컨트롤(S)’을 얻고 난 이후로 실력이 눈에 띄게 좋아졌어.” 함께 훈련하는 바이에른 뮌헨의 동료들이 깜짝 놀라며 또 무슨 깨달음을 얻은 거냐고 질문을 쏟아냈을 정도로. 특히 늘 가장 가까운 곳에서 함께했던 이택현은 틈날 때마다 어이가 없다는 반응을 드러냈다. “하! 진짜 황당하네? 신재욱! 너 뭐야?” “왜?” “너 나랑 매일 같이 훈련하고 나서 뒤에서 몰래 추가 훈련하는 거 아니지?” “뭔 소리야?” “말이 안 되잖아! 말이!” “또 뭐가?” “왜 실력이 갑자기 더 늘었냐고! 재욱아, 이건 진짜 말이 안 되는 거잖아?” 이택현은 어이가 없다는 표정으로 투덜댔다. 반면 신재욱은 할 말이 없었다. 특성이 성장했다고 말할 수는 없으니까. 그냥 미소를 지은 채 모르쇠로 일관할 뿐이었다. “그렇게 된 걸 나보고 어떡하라고.” “하아! 세상은 왜 이리 불공평할까? 왜 세상은 이택현이라는 천재와 신재욱이라는 버그캐릭터를 동시대에 낳은 걸까?” “……버그캐릭터라니 말이 심하네.” “하루아침에 실력이 늘어버리는데 그게 버그지 뭐야? 그리고 이런 게 한두 번이야? 진짜 신재욱 넌 말도 안 되는 버그캐가 맞아. 아오! 많이 따라잡고 있다고 생각할 때쯤이면 꼭 이렇게 멀어진단 말이야?” “…….” 신재욱이 머리를 긁적였다. 이럴 때는 그냥 조용히 있는 게 나았다. 굳이 의미 없는 말로 위로하고 싶은 생각은 없었다. ‘힘이 좀 빠질 수 있지만, 이택현이라면 이겨내고 다시 열심히 하겠지.’ 자신이 봐온 이택현은 강한 친구였으니까. “뭐야, 왜 이렇게 조용해? 야, 재욱아. 너 왜 눈치 보는척해?” “친구가 슬퍼하는데 내가 무슨 할 말이 있겠니.” “어? 허! 안 어울리게 착한 척하지 말고 원래대로 해줄래? 그리고 내가 언제 슬퍼했다 그래? 나 하나도 안 슬프거든?” “그래? 내가 오해했구나.” “오해는 무슨, 너 괜히 나 놀리는 거지?” “그럴 리가. 택현아, 이제 훈련할까?” “자연스럽게 말 돌리네?” 이택현이 황당하다는 시선을 보내왔지만. 신재욱은 그 시선을 무시하며 발바닥으로 근처에 있던 공을 끌어왔다. 장난은 여기까지만 하고, 이제는 훈련에 집중할 생각이었다. 앞으로 있을 일정에 대비해서 체력을 끌어올릴 필요가 있었으니까. * * * DFB―포칼. 흔히 포칼컵이라고 부르는 대회. 이 대회는 독일에 속한 모든 팀이 참여하는 대회로 당연히 그 규모도 매우 크다. 또한, 바이에른 뮌헨에겐 자존심이 걸린 대회였다. 바이에른 뮌헨은 이 포칼컵의 최다 우승 타이틀을 지닌 팀이었으니까. 그래서인지 독일 현지에서도 바이에른 뮌헨의 포칼컵 성적에 대한 기대감을 드러냈다. 「바이에른 뮌헨, DFB―포칼에서 우승할 수 있을까?」 「바이에른 뮌헨, 분데스리가에 이어서 DFB―포칼에서도 우승할까? 독일 최고의 팀이라는 것을 한 번 더 증명할 기회!」 「분데스리가 우승한 바이에른 뮌헨, 주전급 멤버로 DFB―포칼 참여한다!」 └ 바이에른 뮌헨이 DFB―포칼에 주전 선수로 나온다고? 그럼 신재욱도 나오는 건가? 그럼 이번에도 바이에른 뮌헨이 우승하겠구만. └ 신재욱, 람, 리베리, 슈바인슈타이거, 토마스 뮐러, 토니 크로스, 이택현이 있는 바이에른 뮌헨은 너무 강해. 그나마 이길 수 있을 만한 팀은 도르트문트인데, 얘네도 지난 시즌에 바이에른 뮌헨 상대로 한 번도 못 이겼잖아. └ 지난 시즌엔 꿀벌이 처참하게 패배했지. └ 신재욱이 너무 괴물이었어. 근데 신재욱 이번에 U―20 월드컵에도 참여했던데, 몸 상태가 괜찮으려나? └ 그거 벌써 한 달 전이야. 아직도 컨디션 관리를 못 했겠어? 이미 바이에른 뮌헨 측에서 다 관리해줬겠지. 아마 신재욱은 이번 DFB―포칼에서도 잘할 것 같아. └ 프랑크 리베리도 제대로 물이 올랐어. 아르연 로번도 부상에서 복귀하고 시즌 후반부터는 폼이 꽤 올라온 것처럼 보였고. 그리고 이택현은 토마스 뮐러와 프랑크 리베리의 자리를 위협했을 정도로 잘했지. └ 유프 하인케스 감독이 웬일로 욕심을 많이 내네? 분데스리가 우승에 이어서 DFB―포칼도 우승하고 싶은 건가? └ 우승을 원하지 않는 감독이 어딨겠어? 당연히 욕심나겠지. 이처럼 독일 현지 팬들의 관심을 받는 상황에서. 바이에른 뮌헨은 포칼컵에서조차 연승을 이어갔다. 자신들이 왜 분데스리가에서 우승했는지를 경기력으로 보여줬다. 16강부터 아우크스부르크, 도르트문트, 볼프스부르크, 슈투트가르트와 같은 분데스리가의 강팀들과 연달아 만났지만, 단 한 번도 지지 않고 모든 경기에서 승리해냈다. 「12/13시즌 DFB―포칼 우승팀은 바이에른 뮌헨! 분데스리가의 강팀들을 모두 꺾고 진정한 독일 최강팀이라는 것을 증명해!」 「바이에른 뮌헨의 스트라이커 신재욱, 분데스리가에 이어서 DFB―포칼에서도 득점왕 차지해.」 「신재욱, DFB―포칼에서 6경기에 출전해 8골 기록하며 여전히 뛰어난 득점 감각 뽐내!」 포칼컵에서 우승한 이후. 신재욱은 운동에 전념했다. 열심히 몸을 만들고, 기술을 갈고닦으며 새로운 시즌을 준비했다. 특별한 일을 하지 않고, 오로지 다음 시즌만 생각하며 운동만 했다. 그런데 독일 현지에서는 자꾸만 이상한 소문이 돌았다. 「신재욱, 레알 마드리드로 이적하나?」 「유럽 5개 구단이 신재욱 노린다! 2개의 구단은 천문학적인 금액을 이미 준비!」 「신재욱을 원하는 5개의 구단은 어디?」 「바이에른 뮌헨의 레전드, ‘신재욱은 새로운 도전을 원하는 것 같다. 아마 머지않아 바이에른 뮌헨을 떠날 것.’이라며 신재욱의 이적을 예상해.」 신재욱이 여러 유럽 팀들에게 관심을 받고 있고, 실제로 이야기가 오가고 있다는 소문들. 그러나 전부 거짓이었다. 유럽구단들로부터 관심은 꾸준히 받고 있지만, 이적에 대해서 타 구단과 진지하게 이야기를 한 적은 없었다. 그런 상황에서. 독일의 현지 축구팬들은 바이에른 뮌헨이 다음 시즌부터는 힘을 잃을 것이라는 의견을 드러냈다. 바이에른 뮌헨의 감독인 유프 하인케스가 은퇴를 선언했기 때문이었다. 「충격! 유프 하인케스 감독, 바이에른 뮌헨 떠난다!」 「유프 하인케스 감독, 감독직 은퇴!」 그래서일까? 바이에른 뮌헨을 싫어하던 독일의 축구팬들도 이때다 싶어 부정적인 의견을 드러냈다. 이들은 감독과 관련된 이야기 말고도, 다른 주제로도 바이에른 뮌헨을 깎아내렸다. 그중 가장 많은 이야기가 나온 주제는 ‘신재욱’이었다. └ 유프 하인케스 감독이 없다고? 그럼 바이에른 뮌헨의 전력이 많이 약해지겠군. 다음 감독이 누가 오게 될지는 모르지만, 유프 하인케스 감독의 자리를 완벽히 메우진 못할 거야. └ 푸흡! 드디어 바이에른 뮌헨이 약해지는 걸 볼 수 있겠군! └ 2013/14시즌의 바이에른 뮌헨은 많이 달라지겠어. └ 바이에른 뮌헨은 감독이 바뀌게 된 것도 문제지만, 난 지난 시즌에 득점왕을 차지했던 신재욱이 다음 시즌엔 그렇게 못할 거라고 봐. └ 오? 나도 그렇게 생각해! 데뷔 시즌부터 잘한 선수는 두 번째 시즌에는 잘 못 하는 경우가 많거든. 아마 신재욱도 마찬가지일걸? └ 유프 하인케스 감독 밑에선 기회를 많이 받았지만, 다음 감독에겐 그렇지 못할 수도 있지. └ 신재욱이 과연 다음 시즌에도 잘할까? 난 솔직히 신재욱이 팀빨을 많이 받았다고 생각하는데. 만약 이 어린 선수가 바이에른 뮌헨이 아닌 다른 팀에서 뛰었어도 득점왕을 차지할 수 있었을까? 난 절대 아니라고 생각해. └ 맞아. 동료들이 뛰어나서 신재욱이 더 잘하는 것처럼 보인 걸 수도 있어. └ 다음 시즌엔 신재욱의 진짜 실력이 드러날 거야. 이처럼 바이에른 뮌헨의 안티팬들 사이에선 신재욱이 감독빨, 팀빨을 받았기 때문에 득점왕을 차지할 수 있었다는 의견이 많았다. 그러나 신나서 떠들던 이들은 새로운 시즌이 시작된 지 얼마 지나지 않아서 입을 꾹 다물었다. 이들이 그토록 망할 거라고 말하던 신재욱이 분데스리가 2013/14시즌 첫 경기부터 10경기 연속으로 선발 출전했으니까. 10경기 15골 7어시스트를 기록하며 바이에른 뮌헨의 10연승을 이끌었으니까. 「바이에른 뮌헨, 헤르타에게 4 대 2로 승리하며 2013/14시즌 리그 10연승 기록!」 「신재욱, 단단했던 헤르타의 수비 뚫어내며 2골 기록! 현재 득점 1위!」 「헤르타전 2골 넣으며 리그 15골 기록한 신재욱, 이번 시즌에도 득점왕 차지할 수 있을까?」 10경기 15골 7어시스트. 10경기에서 총 22개의 공격포인트를 기록했다는 것. 대단한 일이었다. 전 세계 축구팬들의 관심을 끌 수밖에 없는 성적이었다. 그러나 여전히 신재욱을 의심하는 축구팬들도 존재했다. 이들은 지금의 활약이 길게 이어지진 않을 것 같다는 의견을 드러냈다. 그리고 이들은 3개월 후, 입을 다물 수밖에 없었다. 신재욱이 꾸준히 엄청난 활약을 펼치며 바이에른 뮌헨의 20연승을 이끌었으니까. 그 과정에서 아주 많은 골을 만들어냈으니까. 「축구천재 신재욱, 그에게 2년 차 슬럼프는 없었다! 매 경기 최고의 활약 펼치며 클래스 증명!」 「바이에른 뮌헨, 뉘른베르크에게 3 대 0 승리 거두며 리그 20연승 달성!」 「현재 리그 1위인 바이에른 뮌헨, 20연승 만들며 이번 시즌도 우승에 한층 더 가까워져.」 20경기 33골 13어시스트. 신재욱의 현재 기록이었다. 지난 시즌보단 골 넣는 속도가 줄었지만, 매 경기 선발출전에 풀타임을 소화하고 있다는 게 긍정적이었다. “으……피곤하다.” 뉘른베르크와의 20라운드 경기를 마치고 숙소에 돌아온 신재욱은 입으로는 피곤하다고 했지만. 그의 손은 늘 그랬던 것처럼 침대 옆에 있는 서류뭉치를 들어 올렸다. 스륵! 다음에 만날 상대 팀에 대한 자료가 적힌 서류. 신재욱은 그 서류에 집중하기 시작했다. “피곤해도 할 건 해야지.” 하나도 빼먹지 않고 전부 머릿속에 넣을 생각이었다. 만약 다음 일정이 분데스리가의 경기였다면 이 정도로 암기하려고 하진 않았을 것이다. 대부분이 이미 알고 있는 내용이었을 테니까. 그러나 이번 경기만큼은 이렇게 열심히 암기해야만 했다. 무려 챔피언스리그 16강전이었으니까. 게다가 16강에서 프리미어리그의 강팀인 ‘아스널 FC’를 만나게 됐으니까. “이 시기의 아스널 FC는 꽤 강했던 것으로 기억하는데.”","output":"166 --- After the U-20 World Cup ended, Shin Jaewook took a long month of rest. He participated in training but kept the intensity as low as possible, focusing on recovering his stamina and condition. During this process, Shin Jaewook fully confirmed the effects of his S-grade trait, 'Extreme Ball Control.' [Extreme Ball Control] [Grade] S [Effect] You become extremely good at handling the ball, making dribbling and evading pressure much easier. Additionally, ball trapping and individual skills also improve significantly. A game-changing trait that improves ball handling, dribbling and evading pressure, ball trapping, and individual skills. The effects were, of course, tremendous. \\"After obtaining 'Extreme Ball Control (S),' my skills have noticeably improved.\\" Even his Bayern Munich teammates, who trained with him, were surprised and bombarded him with questions about what kind of enlightenment he had achieved. Especially Lee Taekhyun, who had always been closest to him, showed a reaction of disbelief whenever he had the chance. \\"Ha! This is really absurd, Shin Jaewook! What are you?\\" \\"Why?\\" \\"You're not secretly doing extra training behind my back after our sessions, are you?\\" \\"What are you talking about?\\" \\"It doesn't make sense! It doesn't!\\" \\"What now?\\" \\"Why did your skills suddenly improve even more? Jaewook, this really doesn't make sense, does it?\\" Lee Taekhyun grumbled with a look of disbelief, while Shin Jaewook had nothing to say. He couldn't tell him that his trait had grown. He just smiled and played dumb. \\"What do you want me to do about it?\\" \\"Ha! Why is the world so unfair? Why did the world give birth to a genius like Lee Taekhyun and a bug character like Shin Jaewook in the same era?\\" \\"...Calling me a bug character is a bit harsh.\\" \\"Isn't it a bug if your skills improve overnight? And it's not the first time, right? Shin Jaewook, you really are an unbelievable bug character. Ah! Just when I think I'm catching up, you always pull away like this?\\" \\"...\\" Shin Jaewook scratched his head. It was better to stay quiet at times like this. He didn't feel like offering empty words of comfort. 'He might feel a bit down, but Lee Taekhyun is strong enough to overcome this and work hard again.' The Lee Taekhyun he knew was a strong friend. \\"What's with the silence? Hey, Jaewook. Why are you pretending to be considerate?\\" \\"My friend is sad. What am I supposed to say?\\" \\"What? Huh! Don't pretend to be nice, just be yourself. And when did I ever say I was sad? I'm not sad at all, okay?\\" \\"Is that so? I must have misunderstood.\\" \\"Misunderstood what, you're just teasing me, aren't you?\\" \\"Not at all. Taekhyun, shall we start training?\\" \\"Changing the subject so smoothly?\\" Lee Taekhyun sent a look of disbelief, but Shin Jaewook ignored it and pulled a nearby ball towards him with the sole of his foot. The joking was over, and now it was time to focus on training. He needed to build up his stamina in preparation for the upcoming schedule. --- DFB-Pokal. Commonly known as the Pokal Cup. This tournament involves all teams belonging to Germany and, naturally, its scale is very large. For Bayern Munich, it was a matter of pride. Bayern Munich held the record for the most Pokal Cup titles. Perhaps that's why the local German media also expressed expectations for Bayern Munich's performance in the Pokal Cup. \\"Can Bayern Munich win the DFB-Pokal?\\" \\"Will Bayern Munich, following their Bundesliga victory, also win the DFB-Pokal? An opportunity to prove once more that they are Germany's best team!\\" \\"Bayern Munich, having won the Bundesliga, participates in the DFB-Pokal with their main squad!\\" └ Bayern Munich is playing with their main squad in the DFB-Pokal? Does that mean Shin Jaewook will play too? Then Bayern Munich will win again. └ Bayern Munich with Shin Jaewook, Lahm, Ribéry, Schweinsteiger, Thomas Müller, Toni Kroos, and Lee Taekhyun is too strong. The only team that might have a chance to beat them is Dortmund, but they didn't win a single game against Bayern Munich last season. └ Last season, the bees were brutally defeated. └ Shin Jaewook was too much of a monster. But didn't Shin Jaewook also participate in the U-20 World Cup? I wonder if his condition is okay? └ That was already a month ago. Do you think he hasn't managed his condition yet? Bayern Munich must have taken care of everything. I think Shin Jaewook will do well in this DFB-Pokal too. └ Franck Ribéry is in top form. Arjen Robben has returned from injury and seemed to be in good shape towards the end of the season. And Lee Taekhyun performed well enough to threaten the positions of Thomas Müller and Franck Ribéry. └ Jupp Heynckes seems to be getting greedy, huh? Does he want to win the DFB-Pokal after the Bundesliga? └ What coach wouldn't want to win? Of course, he'd be ambitious. In such a situation where the local German fans were paying attention, Bayern Munich continued their winning streak even in the Pokal Cup. They demonstrated through their performance why they were the Bundesliga champions. From the round of 16 onwards, they faced strong Bundesliga teams like Augsburg, Dortmund, Wolfsburg, and Stuttgart, but they never lost and won every game. \\"Bayern Munich is the 12/13 season DFB-Pokal champion! They prove themselves as the true strongest team in Germany by defeating all the strong teams in the Bundesliga!\\" \\"Bayern Munich's striker Shin Jaewook, after the Bundesliga, also becomes the top scorer in the DFB-Pokal.\\" \\"Shin Jaewook, with 8 goals in 6 games in the DFB-Pokal, continues to show his outstanding scoring sense!\\" After winning the Pokal Cup, Shin Jaewook devoted himself to training. He worked hard on his physique, honed his skills, and prepared for the new season. Without doing anything special, he focused solely on the next season and trained. However, strange rumors kept circulating in the local German media. \\"Is Shin Jaewook transferring to Real Madrid?\\" \\"Five European clubs are targeting Shin Jaewook! Two of them have already prepared astronomical amounts!\\" \\"Which are the five clubs that want Shin Jaewook?\\" \\"A Bayern Munich legend says, 'It seems like Shin Jaewook wants a new challenge. He will probably leave Bayern Munich soon,' predicting his transfer.\\" Rumors that Shin Jaewook was receiving interest from various European teams and that there were actual talks going on. However, they were all false. While he was consistently receiving interest from European clubs, he had never seriously discussed a transfer with any other club. In such a situation, local German soccer fans expressed the opinion that Bayern Munich would lose strength from the next season onwards. This was because Jupp Heynckes, the coach of Bayern Munich, had announced his retirement. \\"Shock! Jupp Heynckes leaves Bayern Munich!\\" \\"Jupp Heynckes retires from coaching!\\" Perhaps because of this, even German soccer fans who disliked Bayern Munich took the opportunity to express negative opinions. They criticized Bayern Munich on topics other than the coach, with the most discussion centered around 'Shin Jaewook.' └ Jupp Heynckes is gone? Then Bayern Munich's strength will weaken significantly. We don't know who the next coach will be, but they won't be able to perfectly fill Jupp Heynckes' shoes. └ Pfft! Finally, we'll get to see Bayern Munich weaken! └ The 2013/14 season Bayern Munich will be very different. └ Bayern Munich has the problem of changing coaches, but I think Shin Jaewook, who was the top scorer last season, won't do as well next season. └ Oh? I think so too! Players who do well in their debut season often don't perform as well in their second season. Maybe Shin Jaewook will be the same? └ Under Jupp Heynckes, he got a lot of opportunities, but he might not get the same under the next coach. └ Will Shin Jaewook really do well next season? Honestly, I think Shin Jaewook benefited a lot from the team. Would this young player have been able to become the top scorer if he had played for a team other than Bayern Munich? I don't think so. └ Right. It's possible that Shin Jaewook looked better because his teammates were outstanding. └ Next season, Shin Jaewook's true skills will be revealed. Among Bayern Munich's detractors, there was a prevalent opinion that Shin Jaewook was able to become the top scorer because he benefited from the coach and the team. However, those who were so excitedly talking soon shut their mouths not long after the new season started. Shin Jaewook, whom they said would fail, started in the first 10 games of the 2013/14 Bundesliga season. With 15 goals and 7 assists in 10 games, he led Bayern Munich to 10 consecutive victories. \\"Bayern Munich wins 4-2 against Hertha, recording a 10-game winning streak in the 2013/14 season!\\" \\"Shin Jaewook breaks through Hertha's solid defense with 2 goals! Currently the top scorer!\\" \\"Shin Jaewook, with 2 goals against Hertha and 15 goals in the league, can he become the top scorer again this season?\\" 10 games, 15 goals, 7 assists. A total of 22 offensive points in 10 games. It was an impressive feat. It was a performance that could not help but attract the attention of soccer fans worldwide. Yet, there were still fans who doubted Shin Jaewook. They expressed the opinion that his current performance would not last long. And three months later, they had no choice but to shut their mouths. Shin Jaewook continued to perform incredibly well, leading Bayern Munich to 20 consecutive victories. In the process, he scored a lot of goals. \\"Soccer genius Shin Jaewook, no sophomore slump for him! Proving his class with the best performance in every game!\\" \\"Bayern Munich achieves a 3-0 victory over Nürnberg, reaching a 20-game winning streak in the league!\\" \\"Bayern Munich, currently first in the league, gets closer to winning the season with a 20-game winning streak.\\" 20 games, 33 goals, 13 assists. That was Shin Jaewook's current record. Although the rate of scoring goals had decreased compared to the previous season, it was positive that he was starting every game and playing full time. \\"Ugh... I'm tired.\\" After the 20th round game against Nürnberg, Shin Jaewook returned to his accommodation and said he was tired, but his hands, as always, picked up the stack of documents next to his bed. Swoosh! Documents containing information about the next opposing team. Shin Jaewook began to focus on the documents. \\"I have to do what needs to be done, even if I'm tired.\\" He intended to memorize everything without missing a single detail. If the next schedule had been a Bundesliga game, he wouldn't have tried to memorize it to this extent. Most of it would have been content he already knew. But this time, he had to memorize diligently because it was the Champions League round of 16. Moreover, in the round of 16, they were set to face 'Arsenal FC,' a strong team from the Premier League. \\"I remember Arsenal FC being quite strong during this period.\\""},{"instruction":"translate to english","output":"It looks like you wanted to provide some text for translation, but you haven't included any text in your message.

그것도 분데스리가에서?” “너도 옆에서 봐왔잖아. 그냥 매일 열심히, 재밌게 축구 하다 보니까 이렇게 된 거지. 그리고 너도 잘했잖아. 9골 7어시스트 맞나?” “8어시스트거든!” “아 맞다. 9골 8어시스트. 이거 되게 잘한 거야. 그리고 너는 경기 수도 적잖아.” “괜히 그러지 마. 너에 비하면 초라한 성적이야.” 이택현이 부정했지만. 신재욱은 진심으로 이택현을 인정하고 있었다. “겨우 15경기 출전해서 9골 8도움 기록한 거면 되게 잘한 거야.” 15경기 9골 8도움이라는 기록은 아무나 할 수 있는 게 아니었으니까. 더구나 이택현의 나이는 만 17세. 분데스리가에서 이 정도 활약을 펼친 건 굉장한 일이다. “…그래?” “사실 너도 잘했다는 거 알잖아.” “크흠! 솔직히 처음엔 그렇게 생각했었는데, 네 기록 보니까 눈이 높아지더라고.” “다음 시즌에 더 잘하자. 그러면 되는 거야.” “…알겠어. 지금처럼 열심히 하면 다음 시즌엔 더 좋은 성적 낼 수 있겠지?” “당연하지.” “좋아! 해보자! 이 이택현 님이 다음 시즌엔 20골 20어시스트 하는 거 보여줄게! 그럼 이제 내일부턴 지옥훈련 시작이다! 재욱아! 내일부터 끝을 알 수 없을 정도로 어마어마한 지옥훈련 들어갈 준비 됐지?” 어느새 기가 살아서 떠들어대는 이택현의 모습을 보며. “그래, 가보자.” 신재욱은 웃으며 고개를 끄덕였다. * * * 분데스리가 2012/13시즌이 끝난 이후. 바이에른 뮌헨 동료들은 각자의 시간을 보냈다. 바쁜 시즌을 달려오며 지친 몸과 정신을 회복하기 위해 휴가를 떠난 선수들도 있었고, 그동안 가지 못했던 고향으로 가서 시간을 보내려는 동료도 있었다. 그리고 국가대표팀에 합류하며 또다시 일정을 소화하는 선수들도 존재했다. 신재욱도 그런 선수 중 하나였다. 독일에서 며칠간 휴식을 취한 그는 이택현과 함께 레바논으로 날아가서 성인 국가대표팀에 합류했다. 한국의 축구팬들은 그런 신재욱과 이택현에게 기대감을 드러냈다. └ 오!!!! 신재욱이랑 이택현 오는구나? 이러면 레바논전 무조건 챙겨봐야지!!! └ 레바논 감독은 벌벌 떨고 있을 듯ㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ 분데스리가 득점왕 스트라이커랑 최고의 유망주 윙어가 오네ㄷㄷㄷㄷ └ 이제 신재욱이랑 이택현 포스 장난 아닐 거 같네ㅎㅎㅎㅎ 레바논 상대로 엄청 잘해주겠지? └ 어우! 벌써 기대된다! 난 레바논 수비수들이 신재욱이랑 이택현을 막을 수 있을지가 제일 궁금해ㅋㅋㅋ └ 막을 수 있겠냐? 분데스리가 수비수들도 잘 못 막는데ㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ 팀이 바이에른 뮌헨이 아니니까 분데스리가에서만큼은 못 해주겠지만, 그래도 신재욱이랑 이택현은 국대 왔을 때 되게 잘해줬잖아. 걍 믿고 보면 될 거 같음. 이처럼 큰 기대감을 드러내면서도, 한국 축구팬들의 마음속엔 불안감이 존재했다. 레바논과의 경기는 단순히 친선경기가 아니었으니까. 2014년에 펼쳐질 FIFA 월드컵의 예선전이었으니까. 그런데. 이들의 불안감은 경기가 시작된 지 얼마 지나지 않아서 사라졌다. 신재욱과 이택현이 레바논을 완전히 박살 내기 시작했기 때문이었다. ― 고오오오오올! 신재욱의 골입니다! 이택현의 크로스를 받아 골을 만들어냈습니다! 아주 정확한 헤더였습니다! ― 분데스리가에서도 물이 오른 헤더 능력을 보여준 신재욱 선수니까요! 대표팀에 와서도 자신의 능력을 보여줍니다! 전반 7분 만에 신재욱 선수의 골로 대한민국이 1 대 0으로 앞서갑니다! 전반 7분에 터진 골을 시작으로 신재욱과 이택현을 중심으로 한 한국의 공격은 레바논의 골망을 열어버렸다. 레바논은 최선을 다했지만, 신재욱과 이택현을 막는 것에 너무 힘을 쓰다 보니 오히려 더 많은 빈틈을 드러내며 무너져내렸다. 「한국, 레바논에게 4 대 1 승리! 바이에른 뮌헨에서 날아온 천재들이 만들어낸 승리!」 「신재욱, 2골 기록하며 1골 1도움 기록한 이택현과 함께 최고의 활약 펼쳐!」 「바이에른 뮌헨 듀오는 달랐다. 수비적인 레바논을 어렵지 않게 뚫어내며 승리 이끌어.」 경기가 끝난 이후. 신재욱은 독일행 비행기에 타지 않았다. 다른 대표팀 동료들과 함께 한국행 비행기에 올랐다. 일주일 뒤에 펼쳐질 우즈베키스탄과의 경기가 한국에서 펼쳐지기 때문이었다. ‘시즌이 끝났는데도 일정이 바쁘네.’ 신재욱은 비행기 의자에 몸을 기대며 눈을 감았다. 잠이 쏟아질 정도로 피곤했다. 꾸준히 몸 관리를 하지 않았다면 소화하기 힘든 일정이었다는 생각이 들었다. ‘이래서 항상 준비를 해둬야 한다니까?’ 한국에 도착한 뒤, 대표팀 선수들은 이틀간 가벼운 훈련만을 하며 사실상 휴식을 취했다. 그 과정에서 신재욱은 대표팀 동료들과 함께 맛있는 음식을 먹으러 다녔다. 몇 가지 맛있는 음식을 먹었는데, 가장 기억에 남는 건 단연 한우였다. “재욱아! 한우 꽃등심 엄청 맛있지 않았어? 하! 살면서 먹어봤던 것 중에 최고였던 것 같아!” “맛있더라.” “와! 진짜 어떻게 그런 맛이 날 수가 있지? 말도 안 되게 고소하고, 입에 넣고 몇 번 씹지도 않았는데 사라져버리던데!” 흥분한 채로 말하는 이택현을 보며, 신재욱이 고개를 끄덕였다. 인정할 수밖에 없는 말이었다. 이번에 맛본 한우는 정말 맛있었다. 환생 전, 그는 한우를 먹어본 적이 없다. 영국에도 소고기는 많으니 굳이 한국의 소를 찾아 먹을 생각을 하지 않았었다. ‘아주 큰 실수를 했어. 그렇게 맛있는 한우를 먹어볼 생각을 안 했다니.’ 하지만 이젠 그 맛을 알았기 때문에, 한국에 올 때마다 먹을 생각이었다. “다음엔 좀 더 여러 가지 종류를 맛봐야겠어.” 그렇게 중얼거린 신재욱은 손에 든 자료를 향해 시선을 옮겼다. 다음 상대에 대한 자료였다. 당장 내일부터 본격적인 훈련에 들어갈 것이기에 이제는 준비해야 했다. 그리고 그 모습을 본 이택현도 당연하다는 듯 종이 뭉치를 손에 쥐었다. “재욱아, 오늘은 몇 시까지 볼 거야? 내일부터 본 훈련이니까 오늘은 가볍게 볼 거지?” “다 외울 때까지.” “……그럴 줄 알았다.” 다음 날부터 신재욱을 포함한 한국 대표팀은 상대의 전술에 맞춘 훈련을 이어갔다. 선수들 모두 훈련에 적극적으로 임하며 경기에 뛰고자 하는 강력한 의지를 드러냈다. 최근에 펼쳐진 레바논과의 경기에서 승리한 선수들답게 기세도 대단했다. 모두 승리만을 생각했다. 그리고 국가대표팀의 홍정태 감독 역시도 다음 경기에서의 승리를 의심하지 않았다. 그것도 매우 압도적인 승리가 될 것이라고 믿었다. “전력에서 우리가 더 강하고, 정신적인 부분에서도 우리가 더 강해. 그러니까 무조건 이긴다. 그리고…….” 홍정태 감독이 말을 끌며, 시선을 옮겼다. 그의 시선이 향한 곳엔 그 누구보다도 열심히 훈련하고 있는 신재욱이 있었다. “재욱이를 데리고 경기에서 지는 건 너무 어려운 일이지. 질 수가 없어.” 한국 나이로 19살의 어린 선수이지만. 기량은 대표팀 내에서 최고인 선수다. 어째서 세계적인 무대에서 통하는지는 아주 잠깐만 지켜봐도 알 수 있었다. “쟨 클래스가 다른 선수니까.” 이처럼 홍정태 감독은 승리에 대한 확실한 믿음이 있었기에, 어떤 상황에서도 놀라지 않을 거라고 자신했다. 그러나 그는 경기가 시작된 지 얼마 지나지 않아서 깜짝 놀랄 수밖에 없었다. 신재욱 때문이었다. * * * 레바논전이 끝나고, 일주일 뒤에 펼쳐진 우즈베키스탄과의 경기. 그 경기를 위해 한국 대표팀 선수들과 우즈베키스탄 대표팀 선수들이 서울의 경기장에 모습을 드러냈다. ― 양 팀 선수들이 경기장에 입장하고 있습니다! 팬분들의 함성이 대단한데요? ― 관중석을 가득 메운 한국 팬분들이 굉장히 열정적인 응원을 보내주고 계십니다! 양 팀 선수들 모두 얼굴에 긴장감이 드러났다. 한국 선수들은 팬들의 응원을 받는 홈경기에서 좋은 모습을 보여줘야 한다는 부담감 때문에 긴장하고 있었고. 우즈베키스탄 선수들은 원정경기를 치른다는 사실에 긴장하고 있었다. 그런 상황에서 전혀 긴장하지 않는 선수가 있었다. 신재욱, 그는 긴장하지 않았다. 그저 경기를 어떻게 풀어나갈지에 대해서 생각할 뿐이었다. ‘우즈베키스탄의 최근 경기를 보면 초반 집중력이 약했어. 그러면 초반에 한 번 몰아붙여 보는 것도 괜찮겠는데?’ 이 경기는 신재욱에게 있어서 특별한 경기가 아니었다. 여러 경기 중 하나에 불과했다. 그래서 더욱 긴장하지 않을 수 있었다. 삐이이이이익! 주심이 휘슬을 불었다. 경기가 시작됐다. 그 순간 신재욱이 직접 공을 몰고 앞으로 나아갔다. “재밌는 거 해볼까?” 그 말과 동시에 오른쪽에서 왼쪽으로 움직였다. 발로는 공을 정교하게 컨트롤했다. 이 움직임으로 덤벼드는 상대 선수 한 명을 가볍게 제쳐냈다. 신재욱은 속도를 냈다. 상대 선수를 끌어들이기 위해서였다. 이제 막 중앙선을 넘은 위치였기에, 우즈베키스탄의 미드필더들은 가벼운 마음으로 신재욱을 막으려고 했다. 위험한 위치가 아니니까 굳이 무리하지 않고 압박만 주겠다는 심리. 그러나 신재욱은 그런 우즈베키스탄 선수들의 심리를 이미 꿰뚫고 있었다. “그렇게 대충 막으면 안 될 텐데.” 신재욱은 덤벼드는 선수 하나를 또다시 제쳐냈다. 가랑이 사이로 공을 넣는 알까기를 이용한 돌파였다. ― 우와! 신재욱 선수가 화려한 드리블을 보여주며 우즈베키스탄 선수 2명을 제쳐냈습니다! 순식간에 2명이 뚫린 상황. 우즈베키스탄 선수들의 눈빛이 변했다. 이들 모두 신재욱의 움직임에서 위기감을 느꼈다. “다들 집중해! 대충 막지 말고 끝까지 따라붙어!” “방심하지 마!” “쟤 분데스리가 득점왕이야! 확실하게 막아!” “더 못 들어오게 해! 빨리 끊어!” 다급한 외침들이 우즈베키스탄 진영에서 쏟아져나왔다. 신재욱이 더 깊숙하게 파고드는 것을 막으라는 외침들이었다. 그러나. 우즈베키스탄의 선수들은 몰랐다. ‘이제 안 갈 거야.’ 신재욱에겐 더 전진할 생각이 없었다는 것을. ‘슈팅할 거야.’ 초장거리 슈팅을 때려낼 것이라는 걸.","output":"164 --- Shin Jaewook let out a hollow laugh. Although not in the same league as him, it was because of a player who had become the top scorer in La Liga, one of the world's top leagues like the Bundesliga. \\"Lionel Messi... How did this guy score 46 goals...?\\" Lionel Messi, currently considered the best player in the world. He had set an amazing record this season as well. 32 games, 46 goals, 12 assists. That was the record Lionel Messi had created in La Liga. An overwhelming number of goals compared to top scorers from other leagues. Not just the goals, but also the presence he showed in every game. This season's Lionel Messi had proven himself to be the best player in the world, both in terms of performance and records. \\"It's no wonder they call him the god of football.\\" Shin Jaewook was aware of Lionel Messi's greatness. He had met him several times on the field before his reincarnation. However, they didn't have a personal friendship. \\"I remember him being quite introverted.\\" Lionel Messi was on the quiet side. It could have been just on the field, or he might not be quiet in private settings. The Lionel Messi that Shin Jaewook had met was a quiet person who was very shy. \\"Will I get closer to him in this life?\\" That was as far as it went. Shin Jaewook erased his thoughts about Lionel Messi. Now, he was focused on himself. \\"36 goals and 19 assists in 20 games is doing well enough. Not completely satisfied, but I can do better next season.\\" Muttering to himself, Shin Jaewook checked his physical condition. He carefully checked from head to toe for any discomfort. Then he brought up his status window to check his stats once again. \\"Good.\\" His physical condition was excellent. There wasn't a single minor injury, and nothing strange was found in the status window. That's when it happened. \\"Jaewook-ss! Are you done with everything?\\" Lee Taekhyun approached as if he had been waiting. \\"What's up?\\" \\"What do you mean what's up, congratulations on becoming the top scorer.\\" \\"Thanks.\\" \\"You're amazing, really. I've been playing soccer with you every day and forgot, but you're a real genius. How can you become the top scorer in your debut season? And in the Bundesliga at that?\\" \\"You've seen it too. Just playing soccer every day with passion and fun, and that's how it turned out. And you did well too. Was it 9 goals and 7 assists?\\" \\"It's 8 assists!\\" \\"Ah, right. 9 goals and 8 assists. That's really good. And you played fewer games too.\\" \\"Don't say that. Compared to you, it's a modest record.\\" Lee Taekhyun denied it. But Shin Jaewook sincerely acknowledged Lee Taekhyun. \\"If you scored 9 goals and 8 assists in just 15 games, that's really good.\\" The record of 9 goals and 8 assists in 15 games was not something just anyone could achieve. Especially since Lee Taekhyun was only 17 years old. It was an incredible feat to perform like that in the Bundesliga. \\"...Really?\\" \\"You know you did well too.\\" \\"Cough! Honestly, I thought so at first, but after seeing your record, my standards got higher.\\" \\"Let's do better next season. That's all we need to do.\\" \\"...Okay. If we work hard like now, we can get better results next season, right?\\" \\"Of course.\\" \\"Great! Let's do it! This Lee Taekhyun will show you 20 goals and 20 assists next season! Then from tomorrow, it's the start of hellish training! Are you ready for the unimaginable hellish training starting tomorrow, Jaewook?\\" Watching Lee Taekhyun, who had come alive and was chattering away. \\"Let's go.\\" Shin Jaewook nodded with a smile. --- After the 2012/13 Bundesliga season ended. The Bayern Munich teammates spent their time individually. Some players went on vacation to recover their tired bodies and minds after a busy season, while others went to their hometowns they hadn't been able to visit. And there were players who joined the national team and continued their schedules. Shin Jaewook was one of those players. After taking a few days of rest in Germany, he flew to Lebanon with Lee Taekhyun and joined the adult national team. Korean soccer fans expressed their expectations for Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun. └ Oh!!!! Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun are coming? I definitely have to watch the Lebanon game!!! └ The Lebanon coach must be tremblingㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ The Bundesliga top scorer striker and the best prospect winger are comingㄷㄷㄷㄷ └ Now Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun's presence will be no jokeㅎㅎㅎㅎ They'll do great against Lebanon, right? └ Wow! I'm already excited! I'm most curious if the Lebanese defenders can stop Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyunㅋㅋㅋ └ Can they stop them? Even Bundesliga defenders can't stop them wellㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ Even though the team isn't Bayern Munich, they won't be able to do as well as in the Bundesliga, but Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun have always done well when they came to the national team. Just trust and watch. While expressing such high expectations, Korean soccer fans also had a sense of anxiety in their hearts. The game against Lebanon was not just a friendly match. It was a qualifying match for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. However. Their anxiety disappeared not long after the game started. Because Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun started to completely smash Lebanon. ― Goal! It's Shin Jaewook's goal! He scored a goal from Lee Taekhyun's cross! It was a very accurate header! ― As Shin Jaewook showed his improved heading ability in the Bundesliga, he shows his ability in the national team as well! Just 7 minutes into the first half, Shin Jaewook's goal puts South Korea ahead 1 to 0! Starting with the goal in the 7th minute of the first half, Korea's attack centered around Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun tore through Lebanon's goal net. Lebanon did their best, but by focusing too much on stopping Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun, they exposed more weaknesses and collapsed. 「Korea wins 4 to 1 against Lebanon! A victory created by the geniuses from Bayern Munich!」 「Shin Jaewook scores 2 goals and shows the best performance along with Lee Taekhyun who recorded 1 goal and 1 assist!」 「The Bayern Munich duo was different. They easily broke through the defensive Lebanon and led to victory.」 After the game ended. Shin Jaewook did not board a plane to Germany. He boarded a plane to Korea with other national team members. Because the game against Uzbekistan was to be played in Korea a week later. 'The season is over, but the schedule is still busy.' Shin Jaewook leaned back in his airplane seat and closed his eyes. He was so tired that he could fall asleep. He thought it would have been a difficult schedule to handle if he hadn't been consistently managing his body. 'That's why you always have to be prepared, right?' After arriving in Korea, the national team players took a light training for two days and essentially rested. During that time, Shin Jaewook went out to eat delicious food with his national team colleagues. He ate several delicious foods, but the most memorable was undoubtedly Korean beef. \\"Jaewook! Wasn't the Korean beef sirloin incredibly delicious? Ah! I think it was the best I've ever had in my life!\\" \\"It was delicious.\\" \\"Wow! Really, how can it taste like that? It was unbelievably savory, and it disappeared without even chewing a few times!\\" Watching Lee Taekhyun excitedly talk, Shin Jaewook nodded. It was an undeniable statement. The Korean beef he tasted this time was really delicious. Before his reincarnation, he had never tasted Korean beef. There was plenty of beef in England, so he never thought to seek out Korean beef. 'It was a big mistake not to have tasted such delicious Korean beef.' But now that he knew the taste, he planned to eat it every time he came to Korea. \\"Next time, I'll have to try a few more varieties.\\" Muttering to himself, Shin Jaewook turned his gaze to the documents in his hand. It was information about the next opponent. Since he was going to start full training from tomorrow, he had to prepare now. Seeing him, Lee Taekhyun naturally grabbed a stack of papers as well. \\"Jaewook, how long are you going to look at it today? Since we're starting full training tomorrow, you're going to look at it lightly today, right?\\" \\"Until I memorize it all.\\" \\"……I knew it.\\" From the next day, the Korean national team, including Shin Jaewook, continued training tailored to the opponent's tactics. All the players actively participated in the training, showing a strong will to play in the game. They were players who had won the recent game against Lebanon, so their momentum was great. They all thought only of victory. And Hong Jeongtae, the coach of the national team, also had no doubt about winning the next game. He believed it would be a very overwhelming victory. \\"We are stronger in terms of power, and we are stronger mentally. So we will definitely win. And…….\\" Coach Hong Jeongtae paused and shifted his gaze. His eyes were on Shin Jaewook, who was training harder than anyone else. \\"It's too difficult to lose a game with Jaewook in it. It's impossible to lose.\\" Although he was a young player of 19 years old in Korean age. His skills were the best among the national team. It was clear why he was successful on the world stage after just a brief observation. \\"He's a player of a different class.\\" Thus, Coach Hong Jeongtae had a firm belief in victory, so he was confident he wouldn't be surprised in any situation. However, he couldn't help but be surprised not long after the game started. Because of Shin Jaewook. --- After the game against Lebanon, a week later, the game against Uzbekistan took place. For that game, players from the Korean national team and the Uzbekistan national team appeared in the stadium in Seoul. ― The players from both teams are entering the stadium! The cheers from the fans are tremendous, aren't they? ― The Korean fans filling the stands are sending very passionate support! All the players from both teams showed nervousness on their faces. The Korean players were nervous because they had to show a good performance in a home game with the support of the fans. The Uzbekistan players were nervous because they were playing an away game. In such a situation, there was a player who was not nervous at all. Shin Jaewook, he was not nervous. He was just thinking about how to play the game. 'If you look at Uzbekistan's recent games, their concentration is weak at the beginning. So it might be good to push them from the start?' This game was not a special game for Shin Jaewook. It was just one of many games. That's why he could be even more relaxed. Whistle! The referee blew the whistle. The game started. At that moment, Shin Jaewook took the ball and moved forward. \\"Shall we do something fun?\\" With those words, he moved from right to left. He controlled the ball precisely with his feet. With this movement, he easily bypassed one of the opposing players. Shin Jaewook picked up speed. It was to draw in the opposing players. Since he had just crossed the center line, the Uzbekistan midfielders tried to stop Shin Jaewook with a light heart. It wasn't a dangerous position, so they didn't need to force it and just applied pressure. However, Shin Jaewook had already seen through the psychology of the Uzbekistan players. \\"You shouldn't block so carelessly.\\" Shin Jaewook bypassed another player. It was a breakthrough using a nutmeg. ― Wow! Shin Jaewook shows off a flashy dribble and bypasses two Uzbekistan players! In an instant, two players were bypassed. The eyes of the Uzbekistan players changed. All of them felt a sense of crisis from Shin Jaewook's movements. \\"Everyone focus! Don't block carelessly and stick to the end!\\" \\"Don't be complacent!\\" \\"He's the Bundesliga top scorer! Block him properly!\\" \\"Don't let him in any further! Cut it off quickly!\\" Desperate shouts poured out from the Uzbekistan camp. They were shouts to prevent Shin Jaewook from penetrating deeper. However. The Uzbekistan players didn't know. 'I'm not going any further.' That Shin Jaewook had no intention of advancing further. 'I'm going to shoot.' He was going to take a long-range shot."},{"instruction":"168 * * * 아스널 FC의 골망이 크게 흔들렸다. 과감하게 중거리 슈팅을 시도한 신재욱의 골이었다. 그 순간 방송에 실시간으로 송출되는 카메라에 아스널 팬들의 얼굴이 잡혔다. 아스널의 팬들은 모두 눈을 동그랗게 뜬 채, 믿을 수 없다는 표정을 하고 있었다. ― 아스널 FC의 팬들이 큰 충격을 받은 표정인데요? 본인들이 응원하는 팀이 선제골을 허용할 거라는 생각을 하지 못했던 것 같습니다! ― 아스널 팬들의 반응이 이해는 됩니다. 아스널은 현재 프리미어리그 2위에 올라 있을 정도로 기세가 좋은 팀이거든요? 아마 아스널의 팬들은 상대가 바이에른 뮌헨이라고 할지라도 아스널이 압도할 것이라고 믿었던 것 같네요. 같은 시각, 바이에른 뮌헨의 팬들도 신재욱의 골에 놀랍다는 반응을 보였다. └ 골!!!!!! 신재욱이 넣었어! 신재욱이 아스널 FC를 상대로 선제골을 넣었다고! └ 누가 얠 의심했어? 이 녀석은 분데스리가의 득점왕이라고! └ 신재욱다운 골이었어. 상대가 아스널이든 뭐든, 얜 자신감 있게 슈팅을 하는 공격수야. 그리고 그 슈팅은 높은 확률로 골이 되지. └ 신재욱은 무서울 정도로 침착해. 방금도 봐봐. 아스널을 상대로 정확한 슈팅을 때려버리잖아. └ 이건 좀 놀랍네…… 솔직히 신재욱이 프리미어리그나 라리가에서는 안 통할 수도 있겠다는 생각이었는데, 착각이었어. 현재 프리미어리그 2위 팀인 아스널을 상대로 이렇게 쉽게 골을 넣을 정도면 라리가는 몰라도 프리미어리그에서는 충분히 통할 것 같아. └ 크흐흐! 경기 시작한 지 얼마 안 됐는데 벌써 골이 나왔어! 이거 이러면 신재욱의 대량득점이 나올 수도 있겠는데? 프리미어리그 최상위권 팀을 상대로 신재욱이 잘하지 못할 수도 있겠다는 생각을 했었기에 나온 반응. 실제로 바이에른 뮌헨의 팬들 말고도 TV로 경기를 본 대부분의 축구팬들이 놀라고 있었다. 그런데 골을 넣은 당사자인 신재욱만큼은 차분했다. 자신을 조금도 의심하지 않고 있었으니까. “오늘 슈팅 감각이 괜찮은데? 더 과감하게 슈팅해도 되겠어.” 그리고 팬들은 몰랐지만. 환생 전, 신재욱은 프리미어리그에서 가장 오래 뛴 선수였다. 프리미어리그에서 세계 최고의 스트라이커가 됐고, 발롱도르까지 탔다. 즉, 프리미어리그는 신재욱에겐 집과도 같은 곳이었다. 당연하게도 상대가 아스널 FC라는 건 아무런 문제도 없었다. 오히려 더 익숙하고 편한 상대일 뿐이었다. “아스널 스타일은 너무 잘 알고 있으니까.” 그렇게 중얼거리며, 신재욱은 웃으며 달려오는 동료들을 바라봤다. 저들의 얼굴에 드러나던 긴장감이 어느새 많이 사라진 게 보였다. 심리적으로 안정이 됐기 때문이리라. 특히 많이 긴장한 모습을 보였던 이택현도 이제는 굉장히 편안해 보였다. “으흐흐! 재욱아! 쩌는 골이었어! 슈팅 제대로 걸렸더라?” “어, 잘 맞았어.” “나도 기회 나오면 과감하게 슈팅해보려고. 왠지 골 넣을 것 같은 삘이라서.” “슈팅할 타이밍이면 해야지.” “오케이! 조금만 기다려. 이 이택현 님이 전반전 끝나기 전에 한 골 넣을 테니까!” * * * 신재욱의 골이 나온 이후. 아스널은 짧고 빠른 패스를 여러 번 시도하며 전진하려 했다. 전형적인 아스널의 축구였다. 그러나 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들은 그런 아스널을 가만히 놔두질 않았다. ― 바이에른 뮌헨의 압박이 강한데요? 아스널이 쉽게 전진하지 못하게끔 효과적으로 막아주고 있습니다! ― 하하! 아스널 선수들이 공을 잡기만 하면 여러 명이 주위를 둘러싸 버리니까, 아스널이 자랑하는 패스 플레이가 나오기 힘드네요. ― 역시 호셉 과르디올라의 바이에른 뮌헨은 유프 하인케스 감독이 이끌던 때와는 다른 스타일로 강하네요. 아스널처럼 짧은 패스 위주로 경기를 풀어나가는 팀들에게 특히나 강한 것 같습니다! ― 지금도 보시면 신재욱 선수까지도 적극적으로 압박을 해주고 있거든요? 바이에른 뮌헨은 경기장에 있는 모든 선수가 체력을 신경 쓰지 않고 강력한 압박을 펼치고 있습니다. ― 스쿼드가 두꺼운 바이에른 뮌헨이기 때문에, 체력을 많이 쓰는 것에 부담이 없는 것 같습니다! 전반전의 흐름은 바이에른 뮌헨 쪽으로 크게 기울었다. 아스널 FC가 계속해서 무언가를 해보려고 할 때마다 바이에른 뮌헨에게 막히는 상황이 나왔다. 자연스레 바이에른 뮌헨의 역습 기회도 생겼다. ― 바스티안 슈바인슈타이거의 좋은 컷팅입니다! 슈바인슈타이거, 바로 토니 크로스에게 연결합니다! 역습 상황에서 공을 잡은 토니 크로스는 최고 수준의 패스 능력을 지닌 선수였고. 지금도 그런 능력을 펼쳤다. ― 엄청난 패스입니다! 토니 크로스가 뒷공간으로 침투하는 토마스 뮐러에게 정확하게 공을 넘겼습니다! 토마스 뮐러의 움직임도 대단했다. 순간적으로 토니 크로스의 패스 경로를 예측하며, 아스널 수비수들의 뒷공간을 뚫어내는 움직임은 예술과도 같았다. ― 토마스 뮐러! 좋은 침투입니다! 깊숙이 침투한 토마스 뮐러는 침착했다. 주변의 상황을 전부 파악하고 있었다. 그래서일까? 아스널의 페널티박스 안에 들어온 그의 발이 빠르게 공을 밀어냈다. ― 오오?! 패스입니다! 페널티박스 안으로 침투하는 신재욱을 향한 패스였다. 직접 슈팅해도 되는 상황에서 패스를 선택한 토마스 뮐러의 눈엔 강한 믿음이 담겨 있었다. “재욱! 한 골 더 넣어버려!” 그 순간 신재욱의 입꼬리가 올라갔다. ‘좋은 패스. 역시 토마스 뮐러야.’ 토마스 뮐러의 패스가 마음에 들었기 때문이었다. 패스의 정확도는 물론이고, 패스의 타이밍이 너무 좋았다. 상대 수비수들이 컷팅해내기 매우 어려운 타이밍에 들어온 패스. 반면 그 타이밍을 아는 신재욱에겐 받기 쉬운 패스였다. 투욱! 신재욱은 발에 힘을 뺀 채로 가볍게 공을 밀어냈다. 슈팅보다는 가볍게 공을 건드린 것에 가까운 행동. 그러나 공의 궤적은 날카로웠다. 골키퍼가 막기 힘든 골대 상단 구석으로 휘어져 들어갔으니까. ― 고오오오오오올! 신재욱 선수의 골입니다! 바이에른 뮌헨이 챔피언스리그 16강 1차전에서 아스널 FC를 상대로 2 대 0으로 앞서나갑니다! ― 의외의 상황인데요? 이 경기가 시작되기 전까지만 해도 두 팀이 치열한 경기를 펼칠 것이라는 의견이 많았거든요? 그런데 막상 뚜껑을 열어보니 바이에른 뮌헨이 아스널을 압도하고 있습니다! ― 아스널의 아르센 벵거 감독이 심판에게 항의하고 있습니다! 신재욱 선수의 오프사이드가 아니냐는 말인 것 같은데요? ― 방금은 완전히 온사이드였죠! 오! 마침 느린 화면이 나오네요! 여길 보시면 신재욱 선수가…… 아! 온사이드가 맞네요! 골이 맞습니다! ― 역시 신재욱 선수의 라인브레이킹 능력은 대단하네요. 신재욱 선수의 오프더볼 움직임은 이제 세계 최고 수준이라고 말해도 될 것 같습니다! ― 하하! 신재욱 선수는 스스로가 세계 최고 수준이라는 걸 지난 시즌에 이어서 이번 시즌에도 증명하고 있죠! 분데스리가에서 이번 시즌에도 유력한 득점왕 후보니까요! 골을 넣은 지금. 신재욱은 공을 들고 경기장 중앙으로 뛰었다. 그냥 뛰는 것이 아닌, 동료들을 부르며 함께 뛰었다. 아스널의 홈구장이기에 더욱 신경을 쓴 행동이었다. ‘팀의 기세를 올려서 나쁠 건 없지.’ 이때, 달리던 신재욱의 시선이 허공으로 향했다. 메시지 하나가 떠올랐기 때문이었다. [민첩이 1 올랐습니다!] ‘민첩이 벌써 오를 줄은 몰랐는데, 역시 챔피언스리그는 다르네.’ 어느새 경기장 중앙에 도착한 신재욱은 미소를 지은 채, 공을 내려놨다. 그러곤 심판을 향해 빠르게 진행해달라는 눈빛을 보냈다. ― 신재욱 선수의 시그니처 세리머니가 나왔네요! 아~! 이러면 해트트릭을 노리겠다는 뜻으로 받아들여도 될까요? ― 하하! 항상 골을 노리는 선수이기 때문에 분명 욕심이 날 겁니다. 신재욱 선수는 이타적인 플레이도 잘하지만, 골 기회가 생겼을 때는 웬만해선 직접 해결하려는 성향이거든요! ― 오늘 신재욱 선수의 컨디션을 보면 충분히 해트트릭도 가능할 것 같긴 합니다! 슈팅을 때리는 족족 골로 연결되고 있거든요? 심판은 고개를 끄덕이며 빠르게 경기를 재개시켰다. 상대 팀인 아스널도 빠른 경기 재개를 원하는 상황에서 굳이 시간을 끌 필요가 없었으니까. ― 경기 재개됩니다! 아스널 선수들의 마음이 급하겠는데요? 해설들의 말처럼 아스널의 움직임은 급해졌다. 현재 프리미어리그 2위에 올라 있는 팀이고, 이기는 것에 익숙해진 팀이었지만. 지금처럼 2 대 0으로 밀리고 있는 상황엔 급해질 수밖에 없었다. 더구나 이 무대는 챔피언스리그 16강 1차전이지 않은가. 오늘 좋은 결과를 내지 못하면, 2차전에 힘들어지게 된다는 걸 알기에 아스널 선수들의 얼굴엔 다급함이 드러났다. ― 아스널이 빠르게 패스를 주고받습니다! 이 패스 플레이가 이번 시즌의 프리미어리그에서는 굉장히 잘 통했거든요? 아스널의 패스는 날카로웠다. 심리적으로 다급해진 상황이었음에도 패스의 정교함은 살아있었다. 그러나 바이에른 뮌헨의 압박이 너무 강했다. 강한 압박을 받다 보니, 아스널 선수들의 패스 정확도는 낮아질 수밖에 없었다. 또한, 오늘의 심판은 몸싸움에 관대한 편이었다. ― 아! 메수트 외질이 넘어지면서 공을 뺏겼습니다! 반칙은 선언되지 않습니다! ― 메수트 외질 선수! 지금은 빠르게 처리를 했어야죠! 이러면 아스널이 또다시 바이에른 뮌헨에게 역습을 허용합니다! 바이에른 뮌헨의 역습 상황. 2점 차로 경기에서 이기고 있었음에도 토니 크로스의 패스는 날카로움을 잃지 않았다. ― 토니 크로스! 환상적인 패스입니다! 신재욱 선수를 향해 좋은 패스를 보냈습니다! 토니 크로스의 발을 떠난 공이 포물선을 그리며 날아갔다. 최전방으로 달려나가는 신재욱에게 보내진 공이었다. 다만 쉽게 받을 수 있는 공은 아니었다. 상대 중앙수비수도 신재욱의 옆에서 함께 뛰고 있었으니까. 이럴 땐 퍼스트 터치가 조금이라도 길면 곧바로 수비수에게 공을 넘겨줄 수도 있다. 그래서 신재욱은 더욱 집중했다. ‘좋은 스트라이커는 어떤 상황에서든 좋은 퍼스트 터치를 보여줄 필요가 있지.’ 퍼억! 강하게 몸을 부딪쳐오는 상대 수비수의 행동에도 집중력을 잃지 않았다. 날아오는 공의 움직임을 끝까지 주시했다. 그러면서도 상대 수비수와의 몸싸움에서 밀리지 않고 몸을 틀었다. 순간적으로 공을 지켜내기 좋은 각도를 만들어낸 것이었다. 그 순간 신재욱이 발을 뻗었다. 발등으로 공을 부드럽게 받아냈다. 여전히 상대 수비수의 방해가 있었지만, 흔들리지 않고 공을 컨트롤해냈다. ― 아름다운 퍼스트 터치입니다! 신재욱 선수의 퍼스트 터치는 정말 볼 때마다 예술이네요! 퍼스트 터치를 잘 해낸 상황. 신재욱은 상대 수비수를 등진 채, 몸을 돌려냈다. 또다시 방해가 있었지만, 신재욱은 상대 수비수와의 심리전에서 완전히 압도했다. ― 우와! 신재욱 선수가 상체 페인팅을 섞어주며 수비수를 떨쳐냈습니다! 골키퍼와의 일대일 상황이 만들어졌습니다! 골키퍼와의 일대일. 그런 상황을 만들어낸 지금. 신재욱의 시야엔 보였다. 이런 상황이 믿을 수 없다는 듯, 놀란 얼굴을 한 아스널 FC의 팬들의 모습이. ‘놀라기엔 아직 이른데.’","output":"168 --- Arsenal FC's net shook violently. It was a goal by Shin Jaewook, who had boldly attempted a mid-range shot. At that moment, the faces of Arsenal fans were captured by the camera broadcasting live. All the Arsenal fans had their eyes wide open, with expressions of disbelief. \\"The Arsenal FC fans look shocked, don't they? It seems they didn't expect their team to concede the first goal!\\" \\"I understand the reaction of the Arsenal fans. Arsenal is currently second in the Premier League and is a team with good momentum. Perhaps the Arsenal fans believed that even against Bayern Munich, Arsenal would dominate.\\" At the same time, Bayern Munich fans also showed surprise at Shin Jaewook's goal. \\"Goal!!!!!! Shin Jaewook scored! Shin Jaewook has scored the opening goal against Arsenal FC!\\" \\"Who doubted him? This guy is the Bundesliga's top scorer!\\" \\"That was a typical Shin Jaewook goal. No matter if the opponent is Arsenal or whoever, he's a striker who shoots with confidence. And those shots often turn into goals.\\" \\"Shin Jaewook is frighteningly calm. Just look at him now. He's making precise shots against Arsenal.\\" \\"This is a bit surprising... Honestly, I thought Shin Jaewook might not do well in the Premier League or La Liga, but I was mistaken. If he can score this easily against Arsenal, who are currently second in the Premier League, he should be able to do well in the Premier League, even if not in La Liga.\\" \\"Kuhuhu! The game has barely started and we already have a goal! If this continues, Shin Jaewook might score a lot today?\\" The reaction came from the thought that Shin Jaewook might not perform well against a top Premier League team. Indeed, not only Bayern Munich fans but most soccer fans watching the game on TV were surprised. However, Shin Jaewook, the goal scorer himself, was calm. He had no doubt in himself. \\"My shooting feels pretty good today. I can afford to shoot more boldly.\\" And what the fans didn't know. Before his reincarnation, Shin Jaewook was the player who had played in the Premier League the longest. He became the world's top striker in the Premier League and even won the Ballon d'Or. In other words, the Premier League was like home to Shin Jaewook. Naturally, the fact that the opponent was Arsenal FC was no problem at all. Rather, they were a more familiar and comfortable opponent. \\"I know Arsenal's style too well.\\" Muttering to himself, Shin Jaewook looked at his teammates running towards him with a smile. He could see that the tension on their faces had largely disappeared, probably because they felt psychologically stable. Especially Lee Taekhyun, who had looked very nervous, now seemed very relaxed. \\"Uhuhu! Jaewook! That was an awesome goal! Your shot was perfect, right?\\" \\"Yeah, it hit well.\\" \\"I'll try to shoot boldly if I get the chance. I have a feeling I might score.\\" \\"If it's the right timing for a shot, you should take it.\\" \\"Okay! Just wait. This Lee Taekhyun will score a goal before the first half ends!\\" --- After Shin Jaewook's goal. Arsenal tried to advance with short and quick passes several times. It was typical Arsenal soccer. However, the Bayern Munich players did not let Arsenal have their way. \\"Bayern Munich's pressing is strong, isn't it? They are effectively preventing Arsenal from advancing easily!\\" \\"Ha! As soon as Arsenal players get the ball, several players surround them, making it difficult for Arsenal to play their proud passing game.\\" \\"Indeed, Pep Guardiola's Bayern Munich is strong with a different style than when Jupp Heynckes was in charge. They seem particularly strong against teams like Arsenal that play with short passes!\\" \\"Even now, you can see Shin Jaewook actively pressing, right? Bayern Munich has all players on the field exerting strong pressure without worrying about their stamina.\\" \\"Bayern Munich has a deep squad, so they seem to have no problem using a lot of energy!\\" The flow of the first half was heavily tilted towards Bayern Munich. Every time Arsenal FC tried to do something, they were blocked by Bayern Munich. Naturally, Bayern Munich also had opportunities for counterattacks. \\"A good interception by Bastian Schweinsteiger! Schweinsteiger connects it immediately to Toni Kroos!\\" In the counterattack situation, Toni Kroos was a player with top-level passing ability. And he demonstrated that ability now. \\"An incredible pass! Toni Kroos has precisely passed the ball to Thomas Müller, who is penetrating the back space!\\" Thomas Müller's movement was also remarkable. He predicted Toni Kroos's passing path in an instant, and his movement to break through the back space of Arsenal's defenders was like art. \\"Thomas Müller! Great penetration!\\" Deeply penetrated, Thomas Müller was calm. He was fully aware of the surrounding situation. Perhaps that's why? His foot quickly pushed the ball inside Arsenal's penalty box. \\"Oh?! It's a pass!\\" It was a pass towards Shin Jaewook, who was penetrating into the penalty box. Thomas Müller, who could have taken a shot himself, chose to pass with strong belief in his eyes. \\"Jaewook! Score another one!\\" At that moment, the corners of Shin Jaewook's mouth rose. \\"Good pass. As expected of Thomas Müller.\\" He was pleased with Thomas Müller's pass. Not only the accuracy of the pass but also the timing was excellent. It was a pass that came at a very difficult timing for the opposing defenders to cut off. On the other hand, for Shin Jaewook, who knew the timing, it was an easy pass to receive. Thwack! Shin Jaewook lightly pushed the ball without putting much power into his foot. It was more like a gentle touch than a shot. However, the trajectory of the ball was sharp. It curved into the top corner of the goal, a difficult spot for the goalkeeper to block. \\"Goal! It's Shin Jaewook's goal! Bayern Munich is now leading 2 to 0 against Arsenal FC in the first leg of the Champions League round of 16!\\" \\"An unexpected situation, isn't it? Until the start of this game, many thought that the two teams would have a fierce match? But now that we've opened the lid, Bayern Munich is dominating Arsenal!\\" \\"Arsenal's manager Arsène Wenger is protesting to the referee! He seems to be arguing that Shin Jaewook was offside?\\" \\"That was clearly onside! Oh! Here comes the slow-motion replay! If you look here... Ah! It's definitely onside! The goal is valid!\\" \\"Indeed, Shin Jaewook's line-breaking ability is remarkable. His off-the-ball movement can now be said to be at the world's top level!\\" \\"Ha! Shin Jaewook is proving himself to be at the world's top level this season, just like last season! He's also a leading candidate for the Bundesliga's top scorer this season!\\" Now that he had scored the goal. Shin Jaewook ran with the ball to the center of the field. He wasn't just running; he was calling his teammates to run together. It was a behavior he paid more attention to because it was Arsenal's home stadium. \\"It's not bad to raise the team's momentum.\\" At that moment, Shin Jaewook's gaze drifted into the air. A message had popped up. [Agility has increased by 1!] \\"I didn't expect agility to increase already, but the Champions League is different.\\" Having arrived at the center of the field, Shin Jaewook smiled and placed the ball down. Then he quickly signaled the referee to proceed with the game. \\"Shin Jaewook's signature celebration is here! Ah~! Can we take this as a sign that he's aiming for a hat-trick?\\" \\"Ha! He's always a player who aims for goals, so he'll definitely be eager. Shin Jaewook plays selflessly, but when there's a chance for a goal, he tends to resolve it himself!\\" \\"Looking at Shin Jaewook's condition today, a hat-trick seems entirely possible! Every shot he takes is turning into a goal, isn't it?\\" The referee nodded and quickly resumed the game. There was no need to delay since the opposing team, Arsenal, also wanted a quick restart. \\"The game resumes! The Arsenal players must be in a hurry, right?\\" As the commentators said, Arsenal's movements became more urgent. They were a team that was currently second in the Premier League and accustomed to winning, but they couldn't help but become anxious in a situation where they were trailing 2 to 0. Moreover, this stage was the first leg of the Champions League round of 16. Knowing that if they didn't get a good result today, the second leg would be difficult, desperation was evident on the faces of the Arsenal players. \\"Arsenal is quickly exchanging passes! This passing play has worked very well in the Premier League this season, hasn't it?\\" Arsenal's passes were sharp. Even though they were psychologically desperate, the precision of their passes was alive. However, Bayern Munich's pressing was too strong. With such strong pressure, the accuracy of Arsenal's passes inevitably decreased. Additionally, today's referee was lenient with physical contact. \\"Ah! Mesut Özil has lost the ball after falling! No foul is called!\\" \\"Mesut Özil! He should have processed it quickly! This allows Arsenal to concede another counterattack to Bayern Munich!\\" Bayern Munich's counterattack situation. Despite leading the game by two points, Toni Kroos's passes did not lose their sharpness. \\"Toni Kroos! A fantastic pass! He sends a good pass towards Shin Jaewook!\\" The ball left Toni Kroos's foot and arced through the air. It was sent to Shin Jaewook, who was sprinting up front. However, it wasn't an easy ball to receive. The opposing central defender was also running alongside Shin Jaewook. In such cases, even a slightly long first touch could immediately hand the ball over to the defender. Therefore, Shin Jaewook concentrated even more. \\"A good striker needs to show a good first touch in any situation.\\" Thump! He didn't lose focus even with the opposing defender's body crashing into him. He kept his eyes on the moving ball until the end. While doing so, he twisted his body without being pushed back in the physical battle with the defender. He created a good angle to protect the ball in an instant. At that moment, Shin Jaewook stretched out his foot. He received the ball softly with the instep. Despite the continued interference from the opposing defender, he controlled the ball without faltering. \\"Beautiful first touch! Shin Jaewook's first touch is really artistic every time I see it!\\" With a successful first touch. Shin Jaewook turned his body while keeping his back to the opposing defender. There was more interference, but Shin Jaewook completely dominated the psychological battle with the defender. \\"Wow! Shin Jaewook shakes off the defender with upper body feints! He's created a one-on-one situation with the goalkeeper!\\" One-on-one with the goalkeeper. In this situation he had created. Shin Jaewook's vision caught sight of it. The faces of Arsenal FC fans, who couldn't believe the situation and looked shocked. \\"It's too early to be surprised.\\""},{"instruction":"translate to english","output":"It appears you didn't include any text to translate.

[특성이 성장합니다!] [‘최고급 패스 컨트롤(A)’이 ‘극도의 패스 컨트롤(S)’로 성장합니다!] 메시지의 내용을 본 신재욱의 눈이 커졌다. “와……!” 특성이 성장할 수도 있겠다는 예상은 했었지만. 그라운드의 프로파이터(C)가 성장할 것이라고 봤었다. 그런데 최고급 패스 컨트롤(A)이 성장하다니! 이건 신재욱이 전혀 예상하지 못했던 결과였다. “극도의 패스 컨트롤이라고?” 그래서 기대했다. 안 할 수가 없었다. 무려 S급 특성이었으니까. [극도의 패스 컨트롤] [등급] S [효과] 패스가 대단히 정교해지고, 패스의 강약 조절이 굉장히 편해집니다. 또한, 시야가 매우 넓어집니다. 성장한 특성의 정보를 확인한 지금. 신재욱의 얼굴엔 진한 미소가 지어졌다. “전체적으로 효과가 좋아진 거 같고…… 무엇보다도 A급 때는 없었던 시야 상승 효과가 생겼어.” 효과란에 적힌 내용이 전체적으로 마음에 들었고, 특히나 시야가 매우 넓어진다는 부분에 관심이 생겼다. 휙! 신재욱이 고개를 돌렸다. 주변의 시야를 확인하기 위해서였다. “시야가 탁 트인 느낌이 들긴 하네. 근데 정확한 효과는 훈련 때 확인할 수 있겠어.” 독일로 돌아가면 제대로 확인해봐야겠다는 생각을 하면서, 신재욱은 움직이기 시작했다. 경기가 끝났지만 할 일이 있었다. 신재욱에겐 당연하게 해왔던 일이었다. “신재욱 선수! 여기! 손 좀 흔들어주세요!” “오늘 최고였어요!” “신재욱! 멋있다!” 경기가 끝났음에도 경기장을 벗어나지 않고 여전히 환호를 보내주고 있는 팬들. 그들을 향해 손을 감사함을 표현하는 것은. 축구선수라면 해야만 하는 행동이라고 생각했다. “감사합니다!” 신재욱은 한참이나 경기장에 남아서 팬들과 사진을 찍고, 짧은 대화를 나누며 시간을 보냈다. * * * 국가대표팀 경기를 끝낸 이후. 독일로 돌아온 신재욱은 훈련에 매진했다. 주로 컨디션 회복 훈련이었다. 그렇게 철저히 컨디션 회복에 집중한 뒤, 평소에 해왔던 강도 높은 훈련을 이어갔다. 그러면서도 리그에서의 활약도 계속 이어갔다. 「신재욱, 독일에서 돌아오자마자 함부르크 상대로 해트트릭 기록!」 「바이에른 뮌헨, 함부르크와의 경기에서 8 대 2 대승!」 「바이에른 뮌헨, 프랑크푸르트에게 2 대 0 승리!」 「신재욱, 골은 넣지 못했지만 프랑크 리베리의 골을 도우며 귀중한 어시스트 기록!」 「2골 1어시스트 기록하며 뉘른베르크 무너뜨린 신재욱! 이번 시즌의 유력한 득점왕 자리 굳혔다!」 「바이에른 뮌헨, 뉘른베르크에게 5 대 0 승리!」 대표팀에 다녀온 이후, 신재욱은 모든 경기에 출전했다. 선발로 출전하든, 교체되어 출전하든 어떻게든 출전을 했고. 매번 좋은 활약을 펼쳤다. 우연인지는 몰라도. 신재욱이 출전한 경기에서 바이에른 뮌헨은 매번 승리했다. 자연스레 바이에른 뮌헨의 팬들 사이에서 신재욱의 인기는 폭발적인 속도로 커졌다. └ 다들 이 사실 눈치챘어? 신재욱이 나오는 경기는 다 이겼어! └ 누가 뭐래도 나는 확실하게 말할 수 있어. 신재욱은 바이에른 뮌헨 최고의 선수 중 하나야. └ 바이에른 뮌헨의 보물이지. 아, 보물이라는 말로는 부족하려나? └ 어린 선수답지 않게 몸 관리도 철저한 것 같아. 다들 신재욱이 부상당했다는 말 들어본 적 있어? 없지? └ 신재욱은 정신력도 대단한 선수 같아. 사적으로도 전혀 문제를 일으키지 않지. 이런 건 겨우 17세 선수가 보여줄 수 있는 모습이 아니야. └ 외모도 꽤 훌륭한데 스캔들이 하나도 생기지 않는다는 것도 놀라운 일이야. └ 스캔들? 생길 수가 없지. 신재욱은 오로지 운동만 하거든. └ 알아서 몰래 만나고 있지 않을까? 한국 선수들은 연인을 공개하는 것을 좋아하지 않는다던데. └ 알고 보면 못 만나는 거 아닐까? 어렸을 때부터 안 놀고 축구만 해서 이성 만나는 법을 모를 수도 있잖아. └ 에이 설마. └ 하여튼 경기장에서의 모습과 사생활이 전부 완벽한 선수야. 이런 선수는 롱런할 수밖에 없지. 이처럼 팬들의 기대와 관심을 받는 상황 속에서. 신재욱은 12/13시즌 마지막 경기인 묀헨글라트바흐전까지 모두 출전했고. 마지막까지도 팀의 승리를 이끌었다. 「바이에른 뮌헨, 2012/13시즌 분데스리가 우승!」 「30승 3무 1패라는 화려한 전적으로 압도적 승점 1위 기록한 바이에른 뮌헨, 챔피언스리그에선 어떤 모습 보여줄까?」 최종 전적 30승 3무 1패를 기록하며 90점이 넘는 승점을 기록한 바이에른 뮌헨이었고. 당연하게도 이번 시즌 분데스리가의 우승팀이 됐다. “으하하하! 우승이다! 다들 이번 시즌도 고생 많았어!” “쉽지 않았지만, 그래도 해냈네! 다들 최고였어!” “우승이라니……! 기분 좋은 밤이 될 것 같구만!” “오늘은 파티가 열릴 거니까 다들 일찍 집에 갈 생각은 하지 마! 알겠지?” “날 말리지 마! 오늘만큼은 이 세상에 있는 모든 술을 마셔버릴 거야!” 기뻐하는 바이에른 뮌헨 동료들을 바라보며, 신재욱도 미소를 지었다. “기분 좋네.” 우승을 하는 건 늘 기뻤다. 그 기쁨만큼은 익숙해지지 않았다. 다만, 신재욱의 반응 정도면 매우 덤덤한 편이었다. 다른 선수들과 감독, 코치들 모두 흥분하고 있었고. 몇몇 선수는 감격해서 눈물까지 흘리고 있었으니까. 그때였다. “재욱아…… 이거 진짜야?” 가까이 다가온 이택현이 얼떨떨하다는 표정으로 질문해왔다. “뭐가?” “우승 말이야. 너무 비현실적으로 느껴져서. 우리 몇 년 전까지만 해도 한국에 있었잖아. 근데 지금은 분데스리가에서 우승 트로피를 들었다는 게…… 신기하네.” 신재욱은 이택현의 마음을 이해했다. 어린 나이에 우승을 경험하면 비현실적으로 느껴질 수밖에 없으니까. 그래서 현실적인 말을 해줬다. “그냥 아무 생각 없이 지금을 즐겨. 이 순간이 또 언제 올지 모르니까.” 그 말을 끝으로 신재욱은 동료들이 모여있는 곳을 향해 걸었다. 그곳엔 분데스리가의 우승 트로피가 화려한 자태를 뽐내고 있었다. 마이스터샬레. 분데스리가 우승 트로피에게 붙여진 이름. 흔한 트로피의 모양이 아닌, UFO가 떠오를 정도로 특이한 원반형의 모양을 지닌 트로피였다. ‘오랜만이네. 마이스터샬레.’ 신재욱은 마이스터샬레를 향해 손을 뻗었다. 10kg이 넘는 무게였지만, 힘이 좋아진 신재욱에겐 가볍게 느껴졌다. 트로피를 들어 올린 그 순간. “오!” 아무것도 없던 허공에 여러 개의 메시지가 생성됐다. [체력이 1 올랐습니다!] [슈팅이 1 올랐습니다!] [패스가 1 올랐습니다!] [속도가 1 올랐습니다!] [민첩이 1 올랐습니다!] [대인방어가 1 올랐습니다!] [태클이 1 올랐습니다!] [몸싸움이 1 올랐습니다!] [탈압박이 1 올랐습니다!] [드리블이 1 올랐습니다!] [개인기가 1 올랐습니다!] [헤딩이 1 올랐습니다!] 신재욱이 입을 떡 벌렸다. 그만큼 놀랐다. 지금처럼 모든 능력이 동시에 성장한 건 처음이었으니까. ‘체력이랑 슈팅, 속도까지 성장할 줄이야. 너무 좋은데? 우승한 보람이 있어.’ 모든 능력치가 1씩 오른 것. 분데스리가 우승 트로피를 들어 올린 것에 대한 보상치고는 작다고 느껴질 수 있지만. 신재욱은 지금 결과에 만족했다. 기존의 능력치가 워낙 높은 편이었으니까. ‘더 열심히 해서 다음 시즌엔 모든 능력치가 90을 넘도록 만들어야겠어.’ 새로운 목표를 설정하며, 신재욱은 분데스리가 우승 트로피 ‘마이스터샬레’를 하늘 높이 들어 올렸다. * * * 36골 19어시스트. 한 시즌에 기록했다고 말하기엔 너무나도 대단한 기록이다. 더구나 이 기록을 만들어낸 리그가 세계 최고 중 하나인 분데스리가라면? 더더욱 대단한 기록이다. 그리고 이처럼 놀라운 기록이 겨우 20경기에 출전해서 만들어낸 것이라면? 전 세계가 놀랄 것이다. 이 모든 건 이번 시즌의 신재욱이 만들어낸 일이었다. 「축구천재 신재욱, 분데스리가 2012/13시즌에서 단 20경기에 출전해서 36골 19어시스트 기록해! 믿을 수 없는 기록으로 전 세계가 경악!」 「신재욱! 분데스리가 데뷔 시즌에 득점왕 등극! 득점 2위인 스테판 키슬링보다 11골이나 더 넣었다!」 「골 넣는 기계와 같은 모습을 보여준 신재욱, 이번 시즌 분데스리가에서 팬들을 가장 미치게 만드는 선수 1위로 뽑혀!」 2012/13시즌 분데스리가 득점왕. 신재욱에게 주어진 칭호였다. 그 사실에 전 세계 축구팬들이 경악했다. └ 이건 정말 놀라운 일이야! 한국에서 온 17살 선수가 분데스리가에서 득점왕이 되다니! └ 단순한 득점왕이 아니야! 무려 36골이나 넣었어! 그것도 겨우 20경기에 출전해서 만들어낸 기록이라고! └ 그 대단한 스테판 키슬링이 25골을 넣었고, 레반도프스키가 24골을 넣었을 뿐인데……! 신재욱은 대체 얼마나 대단한 스트라이커인 거야? └ 다들 신재욱의 경기를 안 봤으면, 오늘 저녁부터라도 꼭 다시 봐봐. 완벽한 스트라이커가 뭔지 보게 될 거야. └ 솔직히 말하면 신재욱은 데뷔 이후 몇 경기에선 완벽한 스트라이커는 아니었어. 발이 느리고 몸싸움이 조금 아쉽다는 단점들이 있었지. 체력도 강한 편은 아니었고. 그것 말고도 몸이 따라주지 않는다는 아쉬움도 있었어. 그런데 점점 극복하더니 시즌이 끝나갈 때쯤에 완벽에 가까운 스트라이커가 되어있더라. └ 유소년팀에 있던 신재욱이 바이에른 뮌헨 1군에 올라오면서 바이에른 뮌헨의 공격력이 눈에 띄게 강해졌어. 이건 대단한 일이야. 세계적인 팀의 경기력이 한 선수 때문에 좋아지는 건 보기 힘든 일이거든! └ 난 아직도 신재욱의 나이를 믿지 않아. 물론 얼굴은 17살처럼 보이지만, 저 실력이 어떻게 17살일 수가 있어? 어느 17살을 데려와도 신재욱처럼 할 수는 없을 거라고! └ 20경기 36골 19어시스트라니…… 이런 게 진짜 천재구나. 같은 시각. 이에 못지않게 실시간으로 올라온 한국 축구팬들의 반응 역시 뜨거웠다. └ 와……ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 말도 안 돼ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 한국에서 분데스리가 득점왕이 나올 줄이야ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ 36골???? 이건 진짜 말이 안 되는데;;;;;; └ 20경기 36골 19어시스트ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 무슨 게임이냐고ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 이 기록이 만 17살짜리가 할 수 있는 게 맞아?ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 너무 비현실적이어서 어이가 없네ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ ㅎㄷㄷㄷㄷ이 정도면 전 세계 최고 유망주 아님? └ 전 세계 최고 유망주가 아니라, 이번 시즌만큼은 전 세계 최고의 스트라이커 중 한 명이 된 거지. 세계 최고의 리그 중 하나인 분데스리가에서 압도적인 골 숫자로 득점왕 했으면 그냥 최고 중 하나인 거야. └ 위에 말이 맞음. 다음 시즌은 어떻게 될지 모르지만, 이번 시즌의 신재욱은 기록만 놓고 보면 세계 최고의 스트라이커 중 한 명이 맞아. 예를 들어 이번 시즌 프리미어리그 기록을 봐봐. 프리미어리그 득점왕인 로빈 판페르시가 겨우 26골을 넣었어. 겨우라고 말하니까 좀 이상하긴 하지만, 하여튼 신재욱이 로빈 판페르시보다 10골이나 더 넣었음. └ 돈 열심히 모아서 내년엔 꼭 신재욱 경기 보러 가야지! 얘 경기는 살면서 한 번쯤은 볼 가치가 있을 것 같아! └ 당연히 가치가 있지! 한국의 전설이 될 선수니까! 이처럼 놀라운 기록을 세우며 팬들을 경악하게 만든 상황에서. 당사자인 신재욱은 오히려 기록에는 덤덤한 모습을 보였다. 스스로 못했다고 생각해서는 아니었다. “20경기 36골 19어시스트라…… 되게 잘했네.” 환생 전에 최고의 선수였던 신재욱조차 인정할 수밖에 없는 활약을 펼친 게 맞았다. 다만, 그보다 더 많은 골을 넣은 선수가 있다는 사실 때문에 침착해질 뿐이었다. “리오넬 메시…… 이 사람은 뭔 46골이나 넣었냐……?”","output":"163 --- The best player in the match against Qatar was Shin Jaewook. Anyone who saw the game would not disagree with the result. He had an excellent performance with 3 goals and 2 assists. Perhaps that's why? As soon as the game ended, Shin Jaewook was greeted with a message that his trait had grown. [Trait growth!] ['High-Quality Pass Control (A)' has grown into 'Extreme Pass Control (S)'!] Shin Jaewook's eyes widened at the content of the message. \\"Wow...!\\" He had anticipated that a trait might grow. He thought it would be the Ground Fighter (C) that would develop. But for the High-Quality Pass Control (A) to grow! This was a result Shin Jaewook had not expected at all. \\"Extreme Pass Control?\\" So, he was excited. He couldn't help it. It was an S-grade trait, after all. [Extreme Pass Control] [Grade] S [Effect] Passes become incredibly precise, and the control of the pass's strength becomes very comfortable. Additionally, the field of vision becomes much wider. Now that he had checked the information of the grown trait. A broad smile formed on Shin Jaewook's face. \\"It seems like the overall effect has improved... and above all, there's a new effect of increased field of vision that wasn't there at grade A.\\" He liked the content written in the effects section, and he was particularly interested in the part about the greatly widened field of vision. Whoosh! Shin Jaewook turned his head. It was to check his peripheral vision. \\"It does feel like my vision has opened up. But I'll be able to confirm the exact effects during training.\\" Thinking that he would have to check properly when he returned to Germany, Shin Jaewook started to move. The game was over, but there was work to be done. It was something Shin Jaewook had always naturally done. \\"Shin Jaewook! Over here! Please wave your hand!\\" \\"You were the best today!\\" \\"Shin Jaewook! You're awesome!\\" Despite the game being over, the fans who had not left the stadium were still cheering. Expressing gratitude with a wave of his hand was something he thought a soccer player should do. \\"Thank you!\\" Shin Jaewook stayed in the stadium for a while, taking pictures with fans and having short conversations. --- After the national team game. Shin Jaewook returned to Germany and devoted himself to training. It was mainly recovery training. After focusing thoroughly on recovery, he continued with the high-intensity training he usually did. And he continued to perform well in the league. \\"Shin Jaewook, immediately upon returning from Germany, records a hat-trick against Hamburg!\\" \\"Bayern Munich, 8-2 victory over Hamburg in the match!\\" \\"Bayern Munich, 2-0 victory over Frankfurt!\\" \\"Shin Jaewook, didn't score a goal but assisted Franck Ribéry's goal, recording a valuable assist!\\" \\"Shin Jaewook, with 2 goals and 1 assist, topples Nuremberg! Secures his position as the likely top scorer of the season!\\" \\"Bayern Munich, 5-0 victory over Nuremberg!\\" After returning from the national team, Shin Jaewook played in every game. Whether he started or was substituted in, he played somehow. And he always performed well. It might have been a coincidence. But Bayern Munich won every game Shin Jaewook played in. Naturally, his popularity among Bayern Munich fans grew explosively. └ Did everyone notice this? We won every game Shin Jaewook played in! └ No matter what anyone says, I can say for sure. Shin Jaewook is one of the best players at Bayern Munich. └ He's a treasure of Bayern Munich. Ah, is 'treasure' not enough to describe him? └ He seems to take very good care of his body, unlike young players. Has anyone heard of Shin Jaewook getting injured? No, right? └ Shin Jaewook seems to have a strong mentality too. He doesn't cause any personal problems either. This isn't something a mere 17-year-old player can show. └ He's quite handsome, and it's surprising that there are no scandals. └ Scandals? Impossible. Shin Jaewook only focuses on sports. └ Maybe he's secretly dating? I heard Korean players don't like to go public with their relationships. └ Maybe he can't date? Maybe he doesn't know how to meet the opposite sex because he's been playing soccer since he was young and never played around. └ Come on, that can't be true. └ Anyway, he's a player whose on-field performance and personal life are both perfect. Such a player is bound to have a long career. In such a situation, with the expectations and attention of the fans. Shin Jaewook played in every game until the last match of the 12/13 season against Mönchengladbach. And he led the team to victory until the end. \\"Bayern Munich, 2012/13 Bundesliga champions!\\" \\"With a brilliant record of 30 wins, 3 draws, and 1 loss, Bayern Munich records an overwhelming first place in points! What will they show in the Champions League?\\" Bayern Munich, with a final record of 30 wins, 3 draws, and 1 loss, scored over 90 points. And, of course, they became the champions of the Bundesliga this season. \\"Hahaha! It's a championship! Everyone worked hard this season too!\\" \\"It wasn't easy, but we did it! Everyone was the best!\\" \\"A championship...! It's going to be a good night!\\" \\"There's going to be a party tonight, so don't even think about going home early! Got it?\\" \\"Don't try to stop me! Today, I'm going to drink all the alcohol in the world!\\" Watching his Bayern Munich teammates celebrate, Shin Jaewook also smiled. \\"It feels good.\\" Winning was always a joy. That joy never became familiar. However, Shin Jaewook's reaction was very calm. The other players, the coach, and the staff were all excited. Some players were even moved to tears. That's when it happened. \\"Jaewook... Is this real?\\" Lee Taekhyun, who had approached closely, asked with a bewildered expression. \\"What is?\\" \\"The championship. It feels so unreal. We were in Korea just a few years ago. But now we're holding the Bundesliga trophy... It's amazing.\\" Shin Jaewook understood Lee Taekhyun's feelings. If you experience victory at a young age, it can only feel surreal. So he gave a realistic response. \\"Just enjoy the moment without thinking about anything. You never know when this moment will come again.\\" With those words, Shin Jaewook walked towards where his teammates were gathered. There, the Bundesliga championship trophy was proudly on display. Meisterschale. The name given to the Bundesliga championship trophy. It was a trophy with a unique disc shape, reminiscent of a UFO, not the common shape of a trophy. \\"It's been a while, Meisterschale.\\" Shin Jaewook reached out his hand towards the Meisterschale. It weighed over 10kg, but it felt light to the now stronger Shin Jaewook. The moment he lifted the trophy. \\"Oh!\\" Several messages appeared out of thin air. [Your Stamina has increased by 1!] [Your Shooting has increased by 1!] [Your Passing has increased by 1!] [Your Speed has increased by 1!] [Your Agility has increased by 1!] [Your Man-to-Man Defense has increased by 1!] [Your Tackling has increased by 1!] [Your Physical Dueling has increased by 1!] [Your Press Resistance has increased by 1!] [Your Dribbling has increased by 1!] [Your Technique has increased by 1!] [Your Heading has increased by 1!] Shin Jaewook's mouth dropped open. He was that surprised. It was the first time all his abilities had grown simultaneously. \\"Stamina, shooting, speed... they've all grown. It's too good. It's worth winning.\\" All attributes increased by 1. It might feel like a small reward for lifting the Bundesliga championship trophy. But Shin Jaewook was satisfied with the result. His existing attributes were already quite high. \\"I'll work even harder so that next season, all my attributes will exceed 90.\\" Setting a new goal, Shin Jaewook lifted the Bundesliga championship trophy, the Meisterschale, high into the sky. --- 36 goals, 19 assists. It's an incredible record to claim for a single season. Especially if the league where this record was made is one of the best in the world, the Bundesliga? Even more incredible. And if such an astonishing record was made in just 20 games? The whole world would be amazed. All of this was achieved by Shin Jaewook this season. \\"Soccer genius Shin Jaewook, in the 2012/13 Bundesliga season, scored 36 goals and 19 assists in just 20 games! An unbelievable record that astonishes the whole world!\\" \\"Shin Jaewook! Bundesliga debut season top scorer! Scored 11 more goals than second-place Stefan Kießling!\\" \\"Shin Jaewook, like a goal-scoring machine, voted the player who drove fans the craziest in the Bundesliga this season!\\" 2012/13 Bundesliga top scorer. That was the title given to Shin Jaewook. The fact shocked soccer fans around the world. └ This is really amazing! A 17-year-old from Korea becomes the top scorer in the Bundesliga! └ Not just any top scorer! He scored a whopping 36 goals! And he did it in just 20 games! └ The great Stefan Kießling scored 25 goals, and Lewandowski scored 24... How incredible is striker Shin Jaewook? └ If you haven't seen Shin Jaewook's games, start watching them from tonight. You'll see what a perfect striker is. └ To be honest, Shin Jaewook wasn't a perfect striker in his first few games after his debut. He had some weaknesses, like being slow and lacking in physical duels. His stamina wasn't strong either. There were also regrets that his body couldn't keep up. But he overcame them gradually, and by the end of the season, he had become a near-perfect striker. └ When Shin Jaewook moved up from the youth team to Bayern Munich's first team, Bayern Munich's offensive power noticeably strengthened. This is a big deal. It's rare to see a world-class team's performance improve because of one player! └ I still don't believe Shin Jaewook's age. Of course, his face looks 17, but how can that skill be of a 17-year-old? No 17-year-old could do what Shin Jaewook does! └ 20 games, 36 goals, 19 assists... This is what a real genius is. At the same time. The reactions of Korean soccer fans, which were posted in real-time, were also hot. └ Wow... lolololololol I can't believe a Bundesliga top scorer is from Korea lololololol └ 36 goals???? This is really unbelievable;;;;;; └ 20 games, 36 goals, 19 assists lolololololol Is this a game or what lololololol Can a 17-year-old really do this? lololololol It's so unrealistic, I'm speechless lololololololol └ Wow... is this the world's top prospect? └ Not just the world's top prospect, but for this season, he's one of the world's top strikers. If you're the top scorer in one of the world's best leagues with an overwhelming number of goals, you're simply one of the best. └ The comment above is correct. We don't know what will happen next season, but looking at this season's records alone, Shin Jaewook is one of the world's top strikers. For example, look at this season's Premier League records. The Premier League top scorer, Robin van Persie, scored only 26 goals. It sounds strange to say 'only,' but anyway, Shin Jaewook scored 10 more goals than Robin van Persie. └ I need to save up money so I can definitely go see Shin Jaewook's game next year! His games seem worth watching at least once in a lifetime! └ Of course, they're worth it! He's going to be a legend of Korea! In such a situation, where he stunned fans with his amazing record. The person in question, Shin Jaewook, appeared rather indifferent to the record. Not because he thought he had done poorly. \\"20 games, 36 goals, 19 assists... I did really well.\\" Even Shin Jaewook, who was the best player before his reincarnation, had to admit that he had performed well. However, he was calm because he knew there was a player who had scored even more goals. \\"Lionel Messi... How did this guy score 46 goals...?\\""},{"instruction":"167 * * * 분데스리가 21라운드 경기를 앞둔 상황에서. 신재욱의 현재 기록은 20경기 33골 13어시스트였다. 대단한 기록이었다. 아직 남은 경기가 10경기가 넘는다는 것을 생각해보면 지난 시즌의 기록을 뛰어넘을 확률이 높았다. 게다가 지금까지의 기록만으로도 이번 시즌의 득점왕도 사실상 확정이었다. 이처럼 지난 시즌에 이어서 이번 시즌에도 괴물 같은 활약을 펼치는 신재욱의 모습에 독일 현지 축구팬들은 놀랍다는 반응을 드러냈다. └ 신재욱이 벌써 33골을 넣었어……! └ 뭐지? 신재욱한테는 분데스리가가 쉽게 느껴지는 건가? 어떻게 지난 시즌에 데뷔한 애가 2연속 득점왕을 할 수 있는 거지? └ 아직 득점왕은 아니지. 시즌 끝나려면 꽤 남았잖아. └ 33골 넣었으면 득점왕 하겠지. 저 기록을 누가 깰 건데? 그나마 로베르트 레반도프스키가 엄청 잘해주고 있긴 하지만, 시즌 끝날 때까지 30골도 못 넣을 것 같잖아. └ 2시즌 연속으로 득점왕 차지하면 인정해줘야지. 신재욱은 분데스리가 최고의 스트라이커야. └ 신재욱은 골을 너무 잘 넣더라. 그냥 골 넣는 기계 같아. └ 실수가 거의 없다는 게 가장 놀랍지. 신재욱은 중요한 기회를 얻으면 꼭 골을 넣어 주잖아. 이런 스트라이커가 팀에 있으면 든든하지. └ 이 선수가 올해 18살이라는 게 믿어지지 않아. 이런 선수가 경험이 더 쌓이면 얼마나 무서워질까? └ 우리 모두 알고 있잖아? 신재욱은 세계 최고의 스트라이커가 될 선수야. └ 어쩌면 이미 세계 최고일 수도……. 이처럼 신재욱이 분데스리가에서 2시즌 연속으로 좋은 활약을 펼치자, 독일 현지 팬들은 궁금해하기 시작했다. 신재욱이 다른 리그에 가면 잘할 것인가를. └ 근데 신재욱이 프리미어리그에 가면 어떨까? 거친 프리미어리그에서도 살아남을 수 있을까? └ 신재욱 정도면 피지컬 괜찮잖아? 수비수들한테 크게 밀리는 경우는 별로 없었던 것 같은데? └ 프리미어리그는 분데스리가보다 훨씬 더 거칠어. 그리고 솔직히……분데스리가보다 프리미어리그가 좀 더 강한 리그인 건 맞으니까……신재욱이 별로 못 할 수도 있을 듯. └ 그럼 라리가에선 어떨까? 신재욱은 라리가 스타일이랑도 잘 맞을 것 같은데. └ 잘하겠지. 패스를 잘하니까. 이타적인 플레이도 잘하고, 침투, 기술 전부 좋아서 스페인 리그에 잘 맞을 수밖에 없어. └ 근데 모르는 거야. 가봐야 아는 거야. 라리가도 세계 최고의 리그 중 하나거든. 특히 레알 마드리드랑 바르셀로나는 세계 최고의 팀들이고. └ 신재욱은 만약 프리미어리그나 라리가로 가면 무조건 잘해야 해. 분데스리가에서 득점왕 한 선수가 타 리그에서 못하는 꼴은 보기 싫어 └ 궁금하긴 하다. 신재욱이 다른 리그의 강팀들과 경기해도 지금처럼 잘할 수 있을까? 시간이 흐를수록 독일 현지 축구팬들의 궁금증은 더욱 커졌다. 그리고 며칠 뒤. 그에 대한 궁금증을 조금이나마 해소해줄 만한 경기가 펼쳐질 날이 다가왔다. 「바이에른 뮌헨 vs 아스널 FC, 챔피언스리그 16강에서 만났다!」 「분데스리가 득점왕 신재욱, 프리미어리그의 강팀 아스널 FC를 상대로도 골 넣을 수 있을까?」 「18세의 천재 스트라이커, 아스널을 상대로 실력 보여주나?」 지난 시즌 분데스리가 우승팀이자, 이번 시즌도 리그 1위를 유지하고 있는 바이에른 뮌헨. 그리고 지난 시즌 프리미어리그 4위였고, 이번 시즌도 최상위권을 유지하는 중인 아스널 FC. 이 둘이 챔피언스리그 16강에서 만나게 됐다는 사실에 독일 현지의 축구팬들은 큰 기대감을 드러냈다. └ 신재욱이 아스널 상대로 어떤 플레이를 보여주려나? 분데스리가 득점왕의 자존심을 지킬 수 있겠지? └ 이 경기를 보면 신재욱의 실력이 프리미어리그 수준의 수비수들에게 통하는지 어느 정도는 알 수 있겠지. 그래서 더 기대되는 경기야. └ 아스널이 현재 프리미어리그 2위 맞지? └ 맞아. 아스널 FC가 프리미어리그 2위야. 요즘 아스널 경기력은 굉장히 좋아. 어쩌면 이번 시즌엔 프리미어리그 우승도 할 수 있을 것 같아. 물론 바이에른 뮌헨이 독일 최강의 팀이긴 하지만, 아스널에겐 승리를 장담할 수 없을걸? └ 아스널이 강하긴 해. 이번 시즌의 아스널은 특히 더 강한 느낌이고. 뭔가 FC 바르셀로나랑 비슷한 느낌의 축구를 하잖아. 물론 FC 바르셀로나보다는 약한 것 같지만. └ 난 바이에른 뮌헨의 팬은 아니지만, 분데스리가 득점왕이 프리미어리그의 최상위권 팀을 상대로 잘해줬으면 좋겠어. 그런 상황에서 선수들이 경기장에 입장했다. ― 양 팀 선수들이 경기장으로 걸어들어오고 있습니다! 챔피언스리그 16강 1차전이 펼쳐지려 하고 있습니다! ― 분데스리가 팬분들과 프리미어리그 팬분들이 이 경기를 얼마나 기다렸을까요! 양 팀 선수들의 표정엔 긴장감이 흘렀다. 세계 최고의 팀을 가리는 챔피언스리그라는 거대한 대회였기에, 선수들이 느끼는 중압감은 대단했다. 다만, 양 팀 선수들이 느끼는 중압감은 조금 달랐다. 아스널 FC의 선수들보단 바이에른 뮌헨의 선수들이 더욱 긴장하고 있었다. 오늘 경기가 펼쳐질 장소가 아스널 FC의 홈구장인 ‘에미레이츠 스타디움’이었으니까. ― 선수들이 전부 긴장한 것처럼 보이죠? ― 그렇습니다. 긴장될 수밖에 없겠죠. 서로가 강한 팀이라는 걸 알고 있으니까요. 분데스리가 1위 팀과 프리미어리그 2위 팀이 만난 것이지 않습니까? ― 하하! 그러네요. 세계 최고의 리그에서 최상위권에 속한 팀들과의 경기! 과연 오늘의 승자는 어디가 될까요? ‘다들 엄청 긴장했구나.’ 신재욱은 주변을 둘러보며 미소를 지었다. 팀 동료들이 긴장한 건 경기력에 도움이 되진 않지만, 다행히 상대인 아스널 선수들도 긴장한 게 보였다. ‘내가 할 게 많아지겠어.’ 다른 선수들과는 달리 신재욱은 전혀 긴장하지 않았고, 컨디션도 좋았다. ‘최근 아스널의 경기력이 좋긴 하지만, 못 이길 정도는 아니야.’ 더구나 아스널 FC의 전력에 대해서도 많은 분석을 해둔 상태였다. 확실히 최근 프리미어리그 2위를 달리고 있는 팀답게 굉장히 강하지만. 신재욱에겐 자신감이 있었다. 승패에 상관없이 골을 넣을 수 있다는 자신감이었다. ‘요즘 골 감각이 너무 좋아서 못 넣기가 힘들 것 같아. 그리고 과르디올라 감독의 전술도 나랑 잘 맞는 편이고.’ 신재욱은 고개를 돌려 벤치 근처에서 서 있는 남자를 바라봤다. 머리카락이 전혀 없고 조금 진한 눈썹을 지닌 남자. 이번 시즌부터 바이에른 뮌헨을 이끄는 중인 호셉 과르디올라였다. ‘대단한 능력을 지닌 사람이야.’ 그의 전술은 대단했다. 바이에른 뮌헨이 괜히 유프 하인케스 감독 대신에 데려온 감독이 아니라는 생각이 들 정도로. “아스널전을 대비한 맞춤전술도 괜찮은 것 같고…….” 그렇게 중얼거리던 신재욱이 말을 멈췄다. 그의 시야에 들어온 동료 때문이었다. “이택현!” “…어? 어? 나 불렀어?” 이택현. 부상 때문에 출전하지 못한 프랑크 리베리 대신 선발로 출전한 그는 유독 긴장한 티를 내고 있었다. “왜 이렇게 긴장했어?” “어…? 내, 내가 무슨 긴장을 했다고……그래?” “너 지금 되게 긴장했어. 고개 살짝 숙여서 네 다리 좀 봐봐.” “무슨 말도 안 되는 소리를…….” 이택현은 아니라고 부정하며 고개를 숙였다. 그러나 그는 이내 입을 다물 수밖에 없었다. 후들후들 떨리는 자신의 다리가 보였으니까. “내 말 맞지? 너 긴장했어.” “이, 이게 왜……이러지?” “거의 개다리춤을 추고 있네. 평소엔 별로 긴장 안 하더니만, 챔피언스리그라서 그래?” “…그런 이유도 있는 것 같아. 솔직히 아스널은 우리가 어릴 때부터 TV로 많이 봐왔던 팀이잖아.” “이제 곧 경기 시작하니까 마인드 컨트롤 해. 쟤들도 어차피 다 똑같은 사람들이라는 걸 잊지 마.” “알겠어. 조금 긴장되긴 하는데, 경기 시작하고 조금 뛰면 나아질 것 같아.” 이택현의 대답을 들은 신재욱이 고개를 끄덕였다. 여기서 더 해줄 말은 없었다. 이제부턴 알아서 이겨내야 한다. ‘잘하겠지.’ 신재욱은 이제 스스로에게만 신경을 썼다. 몸의 모든 부위를 움직여보며, 마지막으로 몸 상태를 확인했다. ‘컨디션이 되게 좋네. 이래서 평소에 관리를 잘해야 한다니까?’ 그때였다. 신재욱이 뛰기 시작했다. 삐이이익! 경기가 시작됐기 때문이었다. ― 바이에른 뮌헨이 아스널을 강하게 압박하고 있습니다! ― 오! 바이에른 뮌헨이 시작하자마자 강하게 압박을 펼치는 전술을 들고 왔네요? ― 아무래도 티키타카 전술을 잘 사용하는 과르디올라 감독이기 때문에, 비슷한 스타일을 쓰는 아스널 FC를 공략할 방법도 잘 알 것 같거든요? 그래서 지금 과르디올라 감독이 이끄는 바이에른 뮌헨의 전술이 더욱 흥미롭게 보이는 것 같습니다! 해설들의 말처럼 호셉 과르디올라 감독의 바이에른 뮌헨은 아스널을 강하게 압박했다. 미리 준비한 전술이었다. 분데스리가의 일정들을 소화하면서도 꾸준히 준비한 전술이었기 때문에, 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들은 빠른 패스로 경기를 풀어나가는 아스널을 경기 초반부터 효과적으로 상대했다. ― 아스널의 키어런 깁스 선수가 공을 뺏겼습니다! 아! 바이에른 뮌헨의 압박이 너무 좋은데요? 아스널이 경기 초반에는 힘을 쓰질 못하고 있습니다! ― 바이에른 뮌헨이 공의 소유권을 가져옵니다! 이택현 선수가 신재욱 선수에게 패스합니다! 신재욱은 굴러오는 공을 받기 전, 앞으로 움직였다. 주변에서 들어오는 압박을 미리 확인했기에 나온 움직임이었다. ‘뒤에 한 명, 그리고 오른쪽에도 한 명.’ 2명의 선수가 동시에 압박을 해왔다. 뒤, 오른쪽에서 한 명씩 달라붙고 있었다. 이런 상황에선 상식적으로는 압박이 없는 왼쪽으로 움직일 것이다. 그런데 신재욱은 왼쪽으로 움직이지 않았다. 그는 공을 받자마자 오른쪽으로 방향을 틀었다. 그러자 오른쪽에서 거리를 좁히던 아스널의 선수가 입꼬리를 올리며 도발했다. “뺏기고 싶어서 왔구나?” “그럴 리가.” 피식 웃으며 대답한 신재욱이 곧바로 몸을 회전했다. 상대 선수가 발을 뻗는 타이밍에 나온 마르세유 턴이었다. ‘뚫을 자신이 있어서 온 거야.’ 2명의 압박을 벗어난 지금. 신재욱의 눈엔 허점이 드러난 아스널의 수비진이 보였다. 이런 상황에선 굳이 더 드리블해서 깊숙이 들어갈 필요가 없었다. ‘스트라이커에게 충분히 슈팅할 수 있는 상황이 오면 하는 게 맞지.’ 그대로 슈팅을 때려냈다. 퍼어엉! 골대까지는 거리가 조금 있는 페널티박스 바깥에서 시도한 슈팅. 그러나 슈팅을 때려낸 신재욱의 눈엔 자신감이 드러났다. ‘잘 맞았어.’ 제대로 맞은 느낌이 났으니까. ― 고오오오오오올! 들어갔습니다! 신재욱 선수가 챔피언스리그 16강에서 아스널을 상대로 선제골을 기록했습니다! ― 이야! 정말 대단합니다! 탈압박 이후에 슈팅까지 가져가는 움직임이 너무나도 빨랐습니다! 아스널의 수비진이 전혀 대응하지 못하네요! 선제골이 나오자, 경기장이 조용해졌다. 아스널의 홈구장이었기 때문이었다. 관중석을 가득 메운 아스널의 팬들은 경악한 표정으로 신재욱을 쳐다봤다. 지금 펼쳐진 일은 현재 프리미어리그 2위인 아스널의 팬들에겐 믿기 어려운 일이었다.","output":"167 --- In the situation leading up to the 21st round of the Bundesliga. Shin Jaewook's current record was 20 games, 33 goals, and 13 assists. It was an impressive record. Considering there were more than 10 games left, the chances of surpassing last season's record were high. Moreover, even with the current record alone, he was virtually assured of being this season's top scorer. With Shin Jaewook continuing his monstrous performance this season following the last, German local football fans expressed their amazement. └ Shin Jaewook has already scored 33 goals...! └ What? Does the Bundesliga feel easy to Shin Jaewook? How can a player who debuted last season be on track to become the top scorer for two consecutive seasons? └ He's not the top scorer yet. There's still quite a bit of the season left. └ If he's scored 33 goals, he'll be the top scorer. Who's going to beat that record? Maybe Robert Lewandowski is doing really well, but it doesn't seem like he'll even reach 30 goals by the end of the season. └ If he becomes the top scorer for two seasons in a row, you have to acknowledge him. Shin Jaewook is the best striker in the Bundesliga. └ Shin Jaewook scores goals too well. He's like a goal-scoring machine. └ What's most surprising is that he hardly makes mistakes. Shin Jaewook always scores when he gets an important opportunity. It's reassuring to have such a striker on the team. └ I can't believe this player is only 18 years old. How scary will he become as he gains more experience? └ We all know, don't we? Shin Jaewook is going to be the world's best striker. └ Maybe he already is the best in the world... As Shin Jaewook continued to perform well in the Bundesliga for two consecutive seasons, German local fans began to wonder. How well would Shin Jaewook do in other leagues? └ But what if Shin Jaewook went to the Premier League? Could he survive in the rough Premier League? └ Shin Jaewook has decent physicality, right? It didn't seem like he was significantly outmatched by defenders? └ The Premier League is much rougher than the Bundesliga. And honestly... the Premier League is a bit stronger than the Bundesliga... so Shin Jaewook might not do well. └ Then what about La Liga? Shin Jaewook seems to fit the style of La Liga. └ He would do well. He's good at passing. He plays selflessly, has good penetration, and technique, so he's bound to fit in the Spanish league. └ But we don't know. You have to go there to know. La Liga is also one of the world's best leagues. Especially Real Madrid and Barcelona are among the world's best teams. └ If Shin Jaewook goes to the Premier League or La Liga, he has to do well. I don't want to see a Bundesliga top scorer perform poorly in another league. └ I'm curious. Can Shin Jaewook play as well against strong teams from other leagues as he does now? As time passed, the curiosity of German local football fans grew. And a few days later. The day for a match that could somewhat satisfy their curiosity approached. \\"Bayern Munich vs Arsenal FC, they meet in the Champions League Round of 16!\\" \\"Can Bundesliga top scorer Shin Jaewook score against Premier League powerhouse Arsenal FC?\\" \\"Will the 18-year-old genius striker show his skills against Arsenal?\\" Last season's Bundesliga champions and current league leaders, Bayern Munich. And Arsenal FC, who finished fourth in the Premier League last season and are maintaining their position at the top this season. The fact that these two teams were meeting in the Champions League Round of 16 excited German local football fans. └ I wonder what kind of play Shin Jaewook will show against Arsenal? Can he uphold the pride of the Bundesliga top scorer? └ Watching this game, we can get an idea of whether Shin Jaewook's skills can stand up to Premier League-level defenders. That's why I'm looking forward to this match. └ Arsenal is currently second in the Premier League, right? └ Yes, Arsenal FC is second in the Premier League. Their performance has been really good lately. They might even win the Premier League this season. Of course, Bayern Munich is the strongest team in Germany, but can they guarantee a victory against Arsenal? └ Arsenal is strong. Especially this season, they feel even stronger. They play a style of football similar to FC Barcelona. Of course, they seem weaker than FC Barcelona. └ I'm not a Bayern Munich fan, but I hope the Bundesliga top scorer does well against a top Premier League team. In that situation, the players entered the field. \\"The teams are walking into the stadium! The Champions League Round of 16 first leg is about to unfold!\\" \\"How long have Bundesliga and Premier League fans been waiting for this game!\\" Tension was visible on the faces of both teams' players. It was the Champions League, a grand tournament to determine the world's best team, and the pressure the players felt was immense. However, the pressure felt by the players of both teams was slightly different. The players of Bayern Munich were more nervous than those of Arsenal FC. Because the venue for today's match was Arsenal FC's home ground, the Emirates Stadium. \\"It looks like all the players are nervous, right?\\" \\"Yes, they have to be. They both know they're strong teams. It's the first-place team in the Bundesliga meeting the second-place team in the Premier League, isn't it?\\" \\"Ha! That's right. A match between top teams from the world's best leagues! Who will be the winner today?\\" \\"Everyone seems really tense.\\" Shin Jaewook looked around and smiled. His teammates being nervous wasn't helpful for their performance, but fortunately, it seemed like the Arsenal players were also tense. \\"I'll have a lot to do.\\" Unlike the other players, Shin Jaewook was not nervous at all, and he was in good condition. \\"Although Arsenal's recent performance has been good, it's not unbeatable.\\" Moreover, he had done a lot of analysis on Arsenal FC's strength. They were indeed very strong, befitting a team currently running second in the Premier League. But Shin Jaewook was confident. Confident that he could score goals regardless of the outcome. \\"My goal sense has been too good lately. It seems hard not to score. And Guardiola's tactics suit me well.\\" Shin Jaewook turned his head to look at a man standing near the bench. A man with no hair and slightly thick eyebrows. It was Josep Guardiola, who had been leading Bayern Munich since this season. \\"He's a man of great ability.\\" His tactics were impressive. It made sense why Bayern Munich had brought him in to replace Jupp Heynckes as coach. \\"The custom tactics prepared for Arsenal seem good too...\\" As Shin Jaewook muttered to himself, he stopped talking. It was because of a teammate who had entered his field of vision. \\"Lee Taekhyun!\\" \\"...Huh? What? Did you call me?\\" Lee Taekhyun. Starting in place of the injured Franck Ribéry, he was particularly showing signs of nervousness. \\"Why are you so nervous?\\" \\"Uh...? Me, nervous? What are you talking about?\\" \\"You're really nervous right now. Look down at your legs.\\" \\"What are you talking about...\\" Lee Taekhyun denied it and looked down. However, he soon had to shut his mouth. His legs were trembling. \\"You see? You're nervous.\\" \\"Why... why is this happening?\\" \\"You're almost dancing the shaky leg dance. Are you nervous because it's the Champions League?\\" \\"...I guess that's part of it. Honestly, Arsenal is a team we've watched on TV since we were kids.\\" \\"The game is about to start, so get your mind right. Don't forget they're all just people like us.\\" \\"Got it. I'm a bit nervous, but I think I'll feel better once the game starts and I run a bit.\\" Hearing Lee Taekhyun's response, Shin Jaewook nodded. There was nothing more to say. Now he had to overcome it on his own. \\"He'll do well.\\" Shin Jaewook now focused only on himself. He moved every part of his body and checked his condition one last time. \\"My condition is really good. This is why you have to take care of yourself regularly, right?\\" Then it happened. Shin Jaewook started running. Beep! Because the game had started. \\"Bayern Munich is pressing Arsenal hard!\\" \\"Oh! Bayern Munich has come out with a strong pressing tactic right from the start?\\" \\"Probably because Guardiola is good at using tiki-taka tactics, he seems to know how to attack Arsenal FC, which uses a similar style. That's why the tactics of Guardiola's Bayern Munich seem even more interesting!\\" As the commentators said, Josep Guardiola's Bayern Munich pressed Arsenal hard. It was a pre-prepared tactic. Despite the Bundesliga schedule, they had been steadily preparing this tactic, so Bayern Munich's players effectively countered Arsenal, who were playing with fast passes, from the early stages of the game. \\"Arsenal's Kieran Gibbs has lost the ball! Oh! Bayern Munich's pressing is too good, isn't it? Arsenal can't seem to get any power in the early game!\\" \\"Bayern Munich takes possession of the ball! Lee Taekhyun passes to Shin Jaewook!\\" Before receiving the rolling ball, Shin Jaewook moved forward. He had anticipated the incoming pressure. \\"One behind, and one on the right.\\" Two players were pressing him at the same time. One from behind and one from the right. In such a situation, logically, one would move to the left where there was no pressure. But Shin Jaewook didn't move to the left. As soon as he received the ball, he turned to the right. Then the Arsenal player closing in from the right smirked and taunted him. \\"Did you come here wanting to lose the ball?\\" \\"That's not going to happen.\\" Shin Jaewook smiled and immediately rotated his body. It was a Marseille turn, executed just as the opposing player stretched out his foot. \\"I came here confident I could break through.\\" Now free from the pressure of two players. Shin Jaewook saw the exposed weaknesses in Arsenal's defense. In such a situation, there was no need to dribble further into the box. \\"If a striker gets a chance to shoot, that's what he should do.\\" He took the shot. Boom! A shot from outside the penalty box, a fair distance from the goal. However, confidence was evident in Shin Jaewook's eyes as he took the shot. \\"It hit well.\\" He felt it had connected perfectly. \\"Goaaaaal! It's in! Shin Jaewook scores the opening goal against Arsenal in the Champions League Round of 16!\\" \\"Wow! That's really amazing! The movement from breaking the pressure to taking the shot was too fast! Arsenal's defense couldn't respond at all!\\" As the opening goal was scored, the stadium fell silent. Because it was Arsenal's home ground. Arsenal fans filling the stands looked at Shin Jaewook with astonishment. What had just unfolded was hard for the fans of Arsenal, currently second in the Premier League, to believe."},{"instruction":"Стороны 𝑪𝑲 и 𝑪𝑴 квадрата 𝑪𝑲𝑳𝑴 лежат на катетах равнобедренного прямоугольного треугольника 𝑨𝑩𝑪.

It must handle the complexities of human emotions and relationships with sensitivity and depth. Here's a guide to writing such a story well: 1. **Develop Strong Characters:** - Protagonist: Flesh out the protagonist's personality, background, and motivations. Show his struggle as he grapples with his feelings, making him relatable to the reader. - Brother: Create a nuanced character for the protagonist's brother, possibly making him sympathetic and likable, to complicate the protagonist's feelings of guilt. - Love Interest: The brother's girlfriend should be more than just an object of the protagonist's affection; she needs depth, desires, and her own arc. 2. **Explore Complex Emotions:** - Guilt and Jealousy: The protagonist might feel guilty for his feelings, given his loyalty to his brother. He might also experience jealousy and conflict about his brother's happiness. - Love and Longing: Describe the protagonist's deep affection and longing for the girlfriend, emphasizing the emotional turmoil this creates. - Conflict and Resolution: Internal conflict will be a key element of the protagonist’s journey. Explore how he comes to terms with his feelings towards the end. 3. **Create Realistic Relationships:** - The Brothers’ Relationship: Flesh out the relationship between the brothers before introducing the love interest. This establishes a baseline of their interactions and makes the love story more impactful. - The Romantic Relationship: Show the relationship between the brother and his girlfriend in a realistic light. Avoid demonizing or idealizing it to give credence to the protagonist's feelings. 4. **Build Tension:** - Dramatic tension is important in making the story engaging. The protagonist's secret love should pose a constant dilemma, and there should be moments that threaten to expose his feelings. 5. **Use Subtext and Symbolism:** - Employing subtext allows readers to understand what's going on beneath the surface of dialogues and actions. - Symbolism can be used to reflect the protagonist's inner state, such as metaphors or motifs that represent his unrequited love. 6. **Narrative Voice and Perspective:** - Choose a narrative style that best conveys the story's emotion. First-person can offer direct insight into the protagonist's psyche, while third-person limited can provide necessary distance for more objective analysis of events. 7. **Handle The Romance Ethically:** - It’s vital to deal with the romantic elements of the story without glorifying infidelity or betrayal. The protagonist can struggle with his feelings without acting on them inappropriately. 8. **The Resolution:** - The story should work towards a resolution that is both realistic and satisfying. Perhaps the protagonist realizes the importance of his relationship with his brother, or he may find closure by meeting someone else. 9. **Focus on Personal Growth:** - The protagonist's journey should lead to personal growth. He can learn valuable lessons about love, relationships, loyalty, self-control, or acceptance. 10. **Feedback and Revision:** - Get feedback from a variety of readers to ensure that the emotional complexity of the situation is coming across and that the characters' actions remain sympathetic and understandable. - Be prepared to revise, potentially many times, to refine the subtleties of the story and its characters. Remember, a well-written one-sided love story involves much more than unrequited affection. It's about the characters' growth in the face of emotional challenges and the moral dilemmas they navigate in their relationships."},{"instruction":"write ordered list of acute gastritis symptoms according to prevelance","output":"It's important to note that the prevalence of acute gastritis symptoms can vary widely between individuals, as well as by the cause of gastritis, such as Helicobacter pylori infection, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) usage, or alcohol consumption. However, I will list general symptoms of acute gastritis according to their commonality based on typical clinical presentations: 1. Upper abdominal pain or discomfort – Often described as a burning or gnawing sensation, commonly located in the epigastric region. 2. Nausea – A frequent symptom that may or may not be accompanied by vomiting. 3. Vomiting – While less common than nausea, vomiting may occur and can include the presence of blood if erosion of the stomach lining is severe (hematemesis). 4. Bloating or abdominal fullness – A sense of fullness or distension in the upper abdomen after eating or even when the stomach is empty. 5. Loss of appetite – Due to discomfort and pain in the stomach region, many people experience a decreased desire to eat. 6. Indigestion (dyspepsia) – Symptoms such as bloating, belching, and a sensation of fullness or heartburn might occur. 7. Hiccups – Though less common, persistent hiccups can be associated with irritation of the stomach lining. 8. Gastrointestinal bleeding – This is a more severe symptom and can present as black, tarry stools (melena) or vomiting blood (hematemesis), suggesting possible erosive gastritis. Symptoms may vary and some individuals can even be asymptomatic. It's also important to remember that this order may not be accurate for every case of gastritis and that symptom severity does not necessarily correlate with the severity of the gastritis itself. If someone suspects they have acute gastritis, they should consult a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment."},{"instruction":"mention percentage of occurance","output":"Unfortunately, it is challenging to provide exact percentages for the occurrence of symptoms in acute gastritis because such data vary depending on the underlying cause and patient population, and the literature might not consistently report these figures.

Upper abdominal pain or discomfort – This is the most common symptom, reported in the majority of patients, potentially as high as 80-90%. 2. Nausea – Common, potentially occurring in 50-70% of patients. 3. Vomiting – Frequent but less common than nausea, perhaps seen in 30-50% of cases. 4. Bloating or abdominal fullness – Varies widely but can be reported in 40-60% of patients. 5. Loss of appetite – This symptom could affect around 30-50% of individuals with acute gastritis. 6. Indigestion (dyspepsia) – May be present in 25-50% of patients. 7. Hiccups – Occurrence is rare and specific percentages are not well-documented, but could be less than 5-10%. 8. Gastrointestinal bleeding – This is a less common symptom, potentially occurring in around 10-15% of individuals, but in severe cases or in the presence of erosive gastritis, the percentage might be higher. Please take these figures as rough approximations. The actual prevalence of symptoms can fluctuate based on a multitude of factors, including the specific cause of gastritis, patient demographics (such as age, gender, and ethnic background), geographic region, how the data was collected, and the accuracy of symptom reporting. For reliable statistics, one would need to consult large-scale epidemiological studies specific to populations or look at meta-analyses summarizing data from multiple sources."},{"instruction":"teach me clinical history and physical examination in acute gastritis","output":"The clinical history and physical examination are critical steps in the diagnosis and management of acute gastritis. Here's a guide on how to approach these elements. # Clinical History: When taking a clinical history for a patient suspected of having acute gastritis, consider the following key aspects: **1. Symptom Characterization:** - Ask the patient to describe their symptoms (e.g., pain, nausea, vomiting), including the onset, duration, frequency, location, and character of any abdominal pain or discomfort. - Determine any aggravating or alleviating factors, such as food intake, medications, or positional changes. **2. Dietary and Medication History:** - Inquire about recent dietary habits, alcohol consumption, and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, or other medications that may cause gastric irritation. **3. Past Medical History:** - Document any previous episodes of gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, or gastrointestinal bleeding. - Include a history of H. pylori infection or treatments received. **4. Social History:** - Consider the patient’s lifestyle choices that may contribute to gastritis, such as smoking, alcohol use, or high levels of stress. **5. Family History:** - Ask if there is a family history of gastrointestinal diseases, including gastritis, ulcers, or gastric cancer. # Physical Examination: The physical examination in the case of suspected acute gastritis typically includes the following: **1. General Appearance:** - Evaluate the patient's overall appearance, looking for signs of distress or discomfort. **2. Vital Signs:** - Check for fever, tachycardia, or hypotension, which may indicate severe disease or complications such as bleeding. **3. Abdominal Examination:** - Observe: Look for distension or abnormal movements. - Auscultate: Listen for bowel sounds, which may be normal, increased, or decreased. - Percuss: Check for tenderness, and note any areas of tympany or dullness. - Palpate (performed gently): Detect areas of tenderness, masses, or organ enlargement. Tenderness is often noted in the epigastric region with acute gastritis. **4. Additional Examination:** - Examine for signs of dehydration, such as dry mucous membranes or reduced skin turgor. - Look for signs of anemia, jaundice, or other complications. - Check for any lymphadenopathy, particularly in the supraclavicular area (Virchow's node), which could indicate malignancy in advanced cases involving the stomach. - Perform a rectal examination to test for occult blood in the stool if gastrointestinal bleeding is suspected. # Additional Assessments: If acute gastritis is suspected based on history and physical examination, additional tests may be ordered to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions: - **Lab tests:** Complete blood count (CBC), liver function tests (LFTs), lipase, and a test for H. pylori infection. - **Stool examination:** For occult blood or H. pylori antigens. - **Imaging:** Upper GI series or abdominal ultrasonography if indicated. - **Endoscopy:** Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is the definitive test for diagnosing gastritis and assessing the severity and etiology. When evaluating a patient for acute gastritis, it's important to maintain a differential diagnosis and consider other conditions with similar presentations, such as peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), biliary colic, or pancreatitis. Clinical judgment is crucial, and when in doubt, consult gastroenterology or seek additional diagnostic testing."},{"instruction":"اريد انا اقوم بتحويل نص قصتي الى صور مرسومة. ولذلك سأعطيك النص واريدك ان تكتب prompts للرسومات","output":"بالطبع يمكنني مساعدتك في ذلك. لكن قبل البدء، من المهم التأكد من أن الوصف الذي تزودني به لكل مشهد واضح ومفصل، بحيث يمكنني كتابة تعليمات (prompts) دقيقة للرسام ليفهم بالضبط ما ترغب في إظهاره في الصور المرسومة. يرجى أن تزودني بنص من قصتك وسأقوم بكتابة ال prompts لك."},{"instruction":"**Chapter One** (Did you hear that sound?!) By nature, I am composed during challenging situations; I don’t feel much, and I see this as a positive thing. It acts like a defensive mechanism that distinguishes me, allowing me to move beyond any painful event, no matter how difficult. However, this mechanism only kicks in when I’m alone in my cocoon, away from the infectious emotions of humans. That’s why I prefer to be alone when something tough happens. I don’t want to see anyone or talk about the issue. I have a way of convincing myself that if I pretend it didn’t happen, then somehow, I won’t feel it. But a single word from someone trying to alleviate a sad situation by telling me not to be sad is enough to make me feel upset. “Don’t be afraid” instills fear, and “don’t worry” absolutely makes me worry. The time: February 24, 2022, 5:00 AM. The place: Odessa, Ukraine. - I woke up at dawn, as I wake up every day, but I am not sure if it was the sound of the bombing or the call to prayer because the bombing coincided with the prayer time. - But it’s normal; any noise could be anything, and as long as I’m alone with no human influencer present, I won’t feel or fear, right? - I received a message from a friend who lives far away asking me: “Did you hear that sound?” This means it was a huge explosion, but no, no, I won’t let your human feelings affect me, I’ll continue my day as if nothing happened. - The news started to talk about shelling and about the invasion and the war and about… No, no, it won’t affect me; I’ll continue my day as normal. - I have a final online exam soon, and it hasn’t been canceled. That means everything is still normal and there is nothing to fear or worry about, right? The exam turned out to be difficult, but it’s not a problem, that’s normal. But the most important thing is that the situation is normal, and there is nothing to worry or be afraid of, and nothing will affect me, right? - My family and friends are calling to check on me, their fears beginning to rub off on me. - Another explosion, birds flying away from its source, and I can see the smoke from my window. - I went down to stock on a lot of food from the supermarket, not because of the war or anything, no. I would have gone out anyway because I didn’t have enough food (that’s what I tried to convince myself of). - A worried mother carrying a bag in one hand and a crying child in the other, the source of another explosion unknown, queues at the ATMs, and queues at the cashier, fear and panic everywhere. Young people grabbing whatever they can find on the shelves, a girl stumbles over products beneath her feet but nobody cares, including her. Bags of rice and bread are gone. I tried to grab what I could of tuna cans and any ready-to-eat food, I spent all the money I had on food. - Went out and stood in the long, crowded ATM queue for an hour to withdraw money, seeing the fear and worry in people’s eyes. An old man cracks a joke trying to lighten the mood. - My Egyptian Visa card got blocked and I couldn’t withdraw any money. But no problem, what do I need money for if I have a week’s worth of food? And after that, God will provide. - What I saw since going out affected me, and my mechanism no longer worked. - The only solution was to return to my room and draw; it’s the only thing that would bring me back to the state of numbness I was in before. - I returned to my room infected with the panic and fear and varying human emotions. - I found my Moroccan neighbor coming out of his room, and I asked him, “What’s happening?! What are you going to do??” He said, “Nothing, I’m going to take a shower and then smoke up. You want to join me?!”😂 - Thanks to my Moroccan neighbor, not because he invited me over for a hashish cigarette for the first time, but because he helped me more than the calls of my family and friends to return to my indifferent mood I was in before I went out and saw people. - Now I can continue my day until I see what will happen in the upcoming days. God willing. Note in the Margin - Dear all, please let’s refrain from using a negation when we try to comfort or reassure someone. Avoid saying “don’t be afraid,” “don’t be sad,” “don’t worry,” etc. Let’s use positive words like “be reassured,” “God willing, everything will be fine,” “God will sort it out,” and “This too shall pass.”","output":"To transform your story into illustrated images, here are prompts that you could provide to an illustrator or artist. These prompts aim to encapsulate key scenes and emotions from each significant moment of the narrative. Keep in mind that the level of detail you desire in the illustrations could influence the complexity and time required to create each image: **Prompt 1: Solitude in Contemplation** - Illustrate the protagonist sitting alone in a dimly lit room, exuding an aura of calm composure amidst chaos, possibly with an open window showing a hint of dawn. **Prompt 2: Awakening to Uncertainty** - Depict the protagonist stirred from sleep, with an expression of uncertainty, as both the sound of a distant explosion and the call to prayer permeate the early morning air of Odessa. **Prompt 3: Dismissive of Disturbance** - Convey the protagonist's dismissal of a text message about the explosion, with a focus on a mobile phone screen displaying the message and the protagonist's indifferent stance in the background. **Prompt 4: Denial amidst News** - Show the protagonist actively ignoring or turning off a news broadcast discussing the invasion and war, emphasizing the acts of denial and continuation of daily routine. **Prompt 5: Academic Amidst Anarchy** - Illustrate the protagonist concentrating on a computer screen taking an online exam, with hints of outside turbulence glimpsed through a nearby window. **Prompt 6: Anxiety Through Connectivity** - Draw a scene with the protagonist receiving worried calls from family and friends, portraying the beginning of emotional contagion as concern starts to seep into the protagonist's demeanor. **Prompt 7: Market Mayhem** - Capture the chaos of a supermarket during panic buying with shelves being emptied, people scrambling for goods, and the protagonist filling a basket with tuna cans and other essentials. **Prompt 8: Humor in Hardship** - Picture the protagonist waiting in a long ATM line among anxious faces, with one person (an old man) cracking a joke to alleviate the tension. **Prompt 9: Financial Frustration** - Show a moment of frustration where the protagonist stands in front of the ATM, declined card in hand, revealing the challenge and contemplation of what lies ahead. **Prompt 10: Return to Respite** - Illustrate the peace found in creativity, with the protagonist drawing in their room, surrounded by artwork and tools, retreating back into a state of numbness. **Prompt 11: Neighborly Nihilism** - Showcase a humorous encounter with the Moroccan neighbor emerging carefree from his room, possibly with towel and smoking paraphernalia, offering a laidback alternative to the chaos. **Prompt 12: Positive Perspective Plea** - This prompt could be metaphorical: Display a collection of comforting phrases like \\"be reassured\\" and \\"everything will be fine,\\" shining like beacons or written in the sky above a calming landscape.

Найдите боковую сторону данного треугольника.","output":"Давайте назовем основание равнобедренного треугольника AB и его длину буквой a (a = 36 см). Пусть вершина, противолежащая основанию, - точка C. Медиана, опущенная на основание AB, пусть будет MD, где D – точка пересечения медианы с основанием, а M – середина отрезка AB (точка пересечения медианы с боковой стороной). Длина медианы будет равна половине основания (MD = AD = BD = a/2 = 36/2 = 18 см). Так как треугольник равнобедренный, то медиана MD также является высотой и биссектрисой, следовательно, медиана разделяет равнобедренный треугольник на два равных прямоугольных треугольника. Обозначим боковую сторону равнобедренного треугольника как BC = AC = x. Теперь рассмотрим два треугольника: ΔAMD и ΔBMD. Каждый из них имеет одну сторону, равную x (боковая сторона исходного треугольника), и одну сторону, равную 18 см (MD = AD = BD). Периметр треугольника ΔAMD равен P1 = AM + MD + AD. Аналогично, периметр треугольника ΔBMD равен P2 = BM + MD + BD. Из условия задачи известно, что периметр одного из этих треугольников на 6 см меньше периметра другого. Так как AM и BM – это половины основания равнобедренного треугольника, то AM = BM = a/2 = 36/2 = 18 см. Поэтому периметры прямоугольных треугольников равны: P1 = AM + MD + x = 18 + 18 + x = 36 + x, P2 = BM + MD + x = 18 + 18 + x = 36 + x. Так как оба периметра равны, противоречная информация в задаче.

The genre of this short story should be issekai, magic, romance, drama. Please write the first chapter.","output":"**Title: Aether's Embrace: Chronicles of the Arcane Summoner** **Chapter 1: Upon the Wings of Fate** In the bustling city of Tokyo, high school student Kazuto Yamazaki was as ordinary as they come. With his head often buried in fantasy novels and role-playing games, he could never have imagined that his life was about to shift from mundane to magical in the blink of an eye. On a seemingly typical afternoon, amidst the cacophony of chattering students and the clang of the closing bell, Kazuto lingered within the walls of the school library. His fingertips traced the spines of well-worn books until they paused upon a unique, leather-bound tome that seemed remarkably out of place. An ancient lock barred his way, yet without a key in sight, it sprang open as if recognizing its destined reader. As he read the arcane script dancing upon the delicate pages, the world around him spiraled into a vortex of celestial light. He was no longer within the confines of his school but surrounded by a lush, verdant expanse beneath a sky painted with vibrant hues of a neverending twilight. Kazuto had been transported to Estoria, a world where magic coursed through the very air and mythical creatures roamed the wilds. Staring in awe at the picturesque scenery, he was abruptly jarred from his reverie by a piercing cry for help. Rushing to its source, he found a beautiful elf maiden, her verdant eyes wide with terror, pursued by a horde of snarling goblins. Without a second thought, Kazuto leaped to her aid, yet his courage vastly outmatched his means. He was, after all, just an average student with no prowess in combat. As the goblins closed in, a radiant glyph materialized beneath his feet. To his astonishment, ethereal chains burst forth, ensnaring and banishing the creatures in a flash of light. The maiden, stunned and grateful, introduced herself as Lysandra, an apprentice sorceress from the neighboring kingdom of Aetheria. Their fateful encounter wasn't just a happenstance—according to an ancient prophecy, Kazuto was the Arcane Summoner, a champion from another world destined to wield the Chains of Destiny and maintain the balance of Estoria. He couldn't comprehend why that responsibility fell to him or why the lock yielded to his touch, but a growing sense of duty rooted itself in his heart. Lysandra, bound by her own sense of duty and fascination, pledged to guide and protect Kazuto in this strange realm. As they traveled to Aetheria to meet with the arcane council, Kazuto's feelings for her deepened, entwining with the fibers of this new world. However, their journey was fraught with peril, and emotions complicated the web of politics and power they faced. Little did Kazuto know, the prophecy that heralded his arrival also spun a tale of heartache and betrayal. The true nature of his summoning held secrets that could shatter bonds, unravel prophecies, and shake the foundations of Estoria itself. Thus began the chronicles of Kazuto Yamazaki, the Arcane Summoner whose heart held the key to the world's salvation—or its utter ruin. With every spell cast and every foe vanquished, their saga unfolded, an enchanting manuscript of magic, romance, and drama in the pages of Estoria's history. And with Lysandra's warmth and determination lighting his path, Kazuto dared to believe that he could embrace his destiny and protect the world that had become his own."},{"instruction":"我的朋友很努力的使用杰米这个角色，而我练习了两天的卢克打败了他，我的朋友很沮丧。请你写一篇作文来写我的朋友失败的原因。","output":"标题：分析一场失败：找到成长的关键 在竞技的世界中，失败是在所难免的一部分。当我与我的朋友在一款游戏中展开角色对决时，突显出这个不易的事实。我的朋友选择了杰米这个角色，一个他极力修炼，花费无数个小时去打磨的角色。而我，在这个游戏中主要是以卢克角色出战，仅仅练习了两天，意外地战胜了他。 我的朋友的失败，并不是一个简单的结果，它是多维的。这里我们可以分析至少三个可能影响这个结果的主要因素： 1. **熟悉度与适应性**：尽管我的朋友可能已经精通杰米这个角色，并熟悉他的所有细节，这可能导致他在游戏中过于依赖习惯的打法，而缺乏应变能力。相比之下，我作为一个卢克新手，没有固定模式的限制，可能更加灵活，对于对战的适应可能更快。 2. **心理压力**：当人们投入大量时间和精力时，他们有时会感受到更大的成功压力。我的朋友可能因为害怕辜负自己投入的努力而感到焦虑，这会影响他的表现。同时，作为一个刚开始使用卢克的玩家，我没有面临同样的压力，可能更加轻松地对待比赛。 3. **策略与技术**：各个角色有各自的优势和弱点，在这场对决中，可能我的卢克的打法恰好克制了杰米的风格。这也涉及了策略的选择与执行。练习时间的长短并不总是决定性因素，有时候一个好的策略可以弥补经验的不足。 与我的朋友沮丧相对的学习点在于，失败可以转化为值得的经验和洞察。一败涂地可以是深刻了解自我，乃至超越自我极限的开始。建议我的朋友从以下几个方面进行反思和改进： - **角色理解与打法创新**：真正深入了解角色的能力，并尝试不同的战术组合去创新打法以应对不同的敌手。 - **压力管理与心态调整**：学习如何在游戏中保持冷静，处理失败的能力也是一个重要的成长方向。 - **对手分析与策略适应**：通过分析对手的策略和偏好来更好地准备应对措施。可以通过录像回放来学习对手的习惯和弱点。 - **休息与恢复**：适当的休息对于保持最佳的表现是必不可少的。连续不断的练习未必是最有效率的方式。 最后，重要的是要明白，游戏，和生活一样，面临失败本来就是成长的一部分。相互支持，积极学习，才能在未来的挑战中获得新的胜利。我的朋友，只要能够从这次失败中吸取教训，那么这次失败就不再仅仅是失落，而成为通往成功的一块基石。"},{"instruction":"create twitter post for the API i made to retrive bus schedules GET /api/v1/schedules/:departure/:destination Returns a list of trips between two stations, optionally filtered by departure time and optionally excluding stations before the departure station and after the destination station.

Найдите боковую сторону данного треугольника.","output":"Обозначим боковую сторону равнобедренного треугольника как ( a ), основание треугольника равно 36 сантиметров. Медиана равнобедренного треугольника, проведённая к основанию, делит основание пополам и является также высотой, биссектрисой и делит исходный треугольник на два равных прямоугольных треугольника. Так как медиана делит основание пополам, то каждая половина основания равна 36 / 2 = 18 см. Медиана делит равнобедренный треугольник на два прямоугольных треугольника, гипотенузой которых является боковая сторона ( a ), а одним из катетов является половина основания (18 см). Второй катет - медиана ( m ) - одинаков для обоих прямоугольных треугольников. Периметр одного из прямоугольных треугольников составляет ( P_1 = a + 18 + m ), а периметр другого ( P_2 = a + 18 + m ). Однако, так как периметры этих двух треугольников одинаковы (ведь медиана делит равнобедренный треугольник на два равных треугольника), информация о том, что периметр одного на 6 см меньше другого, не верна или задача поставлена некорректно. Если предположить, что различие в периметрах относится не к прямоугольным треугольникам, а к половинам исходного равнобедренного треугольника после отсечения одного из них по медиане (например, отрезав один из меньших прямоугольных треугольников), то всё равно информация оказывается некорректной, так как каждая половина исходного треугольника будет одинакова. В такой ситуации, чтобы решить задачу, нам нужно определить длину медианы ( m ). Для прямоугольного треугольника медиана, проведённая к гипотенузе, равна половине гипотенузы. Но в данной задаче медиана проведена к основанию, а не к боковой стороне, и найти её длину можно через теорему Пифагора: [ m^2 + 18^2 = a^2 ] Если возникла ошибка в условиях задачи, и на самом деле имелось в виду, что периметр исходного равнобедренного треугольника на 6 см меньше суммы периметров двух образовавшихся прямоугольных треугольников, получим: [ 2a + 36 = 2(a + 18 + m) - 6 ] Упрощаем: [ 2a + 36 = 2a + 36 + 2m - 6 ] [ 2m = 6 ] [ m = 3 ] Теперь мы можем подставить это значение в уравнение, найденное через теорему Пифагора, чтобы найти ( a ): [ 3^2 + 18^2 = a^2 ] [ 9 + 324 = a^2 ] [ 333 = a^2 ] [ a = sqrt{333} ] [ a ≈ 18,25 , см ] Таким образом, боковая сторона равнобедренного треугольника примерно равна 18,25 сантиметров, если правильно интерпретировать условие."},{"instruction":"create a twitter post made an API to retrive kerala private bus schedules using ruby on rails , can retrive schedules sorted by time when departure and destination are provided , also an API to search schedule by bus number github link ; github.com/amith-vp/api","output":"🚍 Exciting news for commuters!

At that moment, time seems to stand still and he and the girl are transported to an unknown parallel world.","output":"Title: The Arcane Chronicles of Kazuto & Lyrinne Volume 1: Shattered Realms and Fated Bonds Plot: Kazuto Yamazaki, a 16-year-old Tokyo high school student, excels at being unnoticed. His routine comprises of attending classes and indulging in video games, his social life is as gray as the city's skyline. One autumn night, his mother sends him on a mundane errand to buy groceries. Little does he know that this trip would catapult him into an odyssey beyond the mundane. As Kazuto returns home, headphones dampening the world around him, a scene unfolds that snaps him back into reality. A young girl, with hair the color of the setting sun and eyes as clear as the untouched sky, steps onto the street, oblivious to the oncoming truck. Instinctively, Kazuto lunges, pushing her out of harm's way. The world halts. A cobalt blue sigil illumines beneath their feet, and the sound of wheels screeches to eerie silence. Time, it seems, holds its breath. In a whisper of light and shadow, Kazuto and the mysterious girl find themselves standing in the twilight of an alien realm. The landscape holds an otherworldly beauty — mountains stretch into the heavens, forests hum with magic, and the air is saturated with the scent of unseen flowers. The girl, recovering from her shock, introduces herself as Lyrinne, a mage on the run from a malevolent empire known as the Ebon Dominion. She reveals that fate, or what her people call the \\"Weave of Destiny,\\" has drawn them together. Kazuto saved not only her life but perhaps the balance of her world. Kazuto, still reeling from the transition, struggles to comprehend his new reality. Unlike his peaceful life in Tokyo, this world is rife with dark forces, magical creatures, and ancient prophecies. Lyrinne explains that she is the key in a struggle against the Ebon Dominion, which seeks to subjugate all free realms under its shadow. As they journey to reach the sanctum of the Eldritch Council, Kazuto discovers an innate talent for arcane artistry. Under Lyrinne's tutelage, he learns to weave spells and harness the latent mana that permeates this land. During their adventures, their bond deepens and a tender romance blossoms amid the tempest of looming war. Despite his newfound powers, Kazuto remains haunted by the question of whether he can ever return home — and whether he even wants to, given the ties that now bind him to Lyrinne and her world. Their path is fraught with challenges as the Ebon Dominion dispatches mystic assassins and twisted beasts to reclaim Lyrinne. Kazuto and Lyrinne witness the cruelty wrought by the empire, the suffering of the innocents, and the brave resistance fighting back. As they evade capture, they gather unlikely allies: a stoic knight whose loyalty is unwavering, a mercurial thief with a heart of gold, and a wise beastkin whose humor belies a tragic past. Together, this band of misfits confronts the darkness, uncovering secrets long hidden and powers long feared. As their fates intertwine, Kazuto and Lyrinne must face the ultimate question: Can a fleeting moment of courage alter the weave of destiny and bring light to a world shrouded in shadow? In \\"The Arcane Chronicles of Kazuto & Lyrinne,\\" readers are drawn into a tale of heroism, love, and the belief that even the most ordinary among us can change the worlds — both those we are born into and those we stumble upon."},{"instruction":"Hye","output":"Hello!

The \`convertExcelToCsv\` method invokes \`runSSConvertCommand\`, which actually runs an external process (\`ssconvert\`) to perform the conversion. Based on your description, if the CSV files are created only after the entire test run is over, it could be due to several reasons related to how the \`ssconvert\` tool buffers output, Java's process handling, or the process' lifecycle. Here's what you could consider to ensure files are created immediately after conversion: 1. **Flush the Output:** Ensure that the external command \`ssconvert\` isn't holding onto the file in a buffer. This could cause a delay in the file being written to disk. 2. **Process Wait:** After starting the process with \`processBuilder.start()\`, the following code waits for the process to complete before returning the status: \`\`\`java return getStatus(process.waitFor()); \`\`\` If \`ssconvert\` writes the file during its execution, then waiting for the process to finish before moving on to the next one is fine. However, if you're not seeing the files, consider checking if there's another spot in the codebase that could be causing a delay or holding up the thread. 3. **Filesystem Caching:** In some cases, the filesystem itself might cache file changes, causing a delay in their appearance. This is typically more of an issue with networked filesystems than local ones. There might not be a straightforward way to \\"force\\" immediate visibility of the files from Java code if sufficient permissions and immediate system calls are already in place. In your Java code, after the \`processBuilder.start()\`, you're correctly reading the output and error streams of the process. These operations shouldn't delay the file creation as they're merely stream handling and should be asynchronous in nature with respect to file creation by \`ssconvert\`. Moreover, the Java code processes the output stream when \`true\` condition is passed. Check the condition to make sure it reflects the actual scenario when you want to process the output. If you are using a debugger, be aware that stepping through code can also delay the external process' operations and give the impression that files are being written late. It would help to know more about the behavior of \`SsConverter\` utility and if it does anything additional that could lead to delays. Generally, file creation should happen at the time \`ssconvert\` is running, not only after the complete execution of your Java program. Finally, to isolate the problem, you could also run the \`ssconvert\` command directly from the terminal to see if the files appear immediately after the command finishes. If there is still a delay, the problem might be within \`ssconvert\` itself or the system environment. If not, you may want to double-check the execution flow of your Java application."},{"instruction":"Please make the changes in code I provided to achieve the goal","output":"Given the code snippet you've provided and the description of your issue, it seems that the conversion process is acting synchronously as expected; the method \`runSSConvertCommand\` should block and wait until the \`ssconvert\` process completes execution and writes the CSV files to disk. However, if there is any issue with the timing of file generation, it could be due to process buffering or system caching, which is generally beyond the control of the Java process invocation. To address common concerns and ensure the code is properly structured, I'll make some clarifications to your existing code. However, the approach itself appears to be correct for synchronous file creation during the conversion process. Here's a slightly cleaned-up version: \`\`\`java package in.cleartax; import com.intuit.karate.junit5.Karate; import in.cleartax.fileConverter.SsConverter; import lombok.extern.slf4j.Slf4j; import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired; import java.io.BufferedReader; import java.io.File; import java.io.IOException; import java.io.InputStreamReader; import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets; @Slf4j public class TestRunner { @Autowired private SsConverter ssConverter; // Assuming SsConverter is a Spring bean/component @Karate.Test Karate testRunner() { // Perform setup tasks, e.g., convert Excel to CSV try { convertExcelToCsv(); } catch (IOException | InterruptedException e) { e.printStackTrace(); // Handle the exception or fail the test depending on your requirements. } // Run Karate feature tests return Karate.run(\\"loginScene.feature\\", \\"ingestion_ui_calls.feature\\", \\"sales_ingestion.feature\\") .relativeTo(getClass()); } private void convertExcelToCsv() throws IOException, InterruptedException { // Your logic for converting Excel to CSV File excelFile = new File(\\"src/main/resources/in/cleartax/Testing-excel.xlsx\\"); File outputDir = new File(\\"src/main/resources/in/cleartax\\"); if (!outputDir.exists()) { log.error(\\"Output directory does not exist: {}\\", outputDir.getPath()); throw new IOException(\\"Output directory does not exist.\\"); } if (!excelFile.exists()) { log.error(\\"Excel file does not exist: {}\\", excelFile.getPath()); throw new IOException(\\"Excel file does not exist.\\"); } String conversionCommand = String.format(\\"ssconvert -S %s %s/%%s_%%n.csv\\", excelFile, outputDir); log.info(\\"Executing ssconvert command : {}\\", conversionCommand); ProcessBuilder processBuilder = new ProcessBuilder(\\"/bin/sh\\", \\"-c\\", conversionCommand); processBuilder.redirectErrorStream(true); Process process = processBuilder.start(); try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader( new InputStreamReader(process.getInputStream(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8))) { String line; while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) { log.info(\\"ssconvert output: {}\\", line); } } int exitCode = process.waitFor(); log.info(\\"ssconvert exit code: {}\\", exitCode); } } \`\`\` Here are the changes I've made to your code: 1.

Confirmed that \`ssConverter\` is properly wired through Spring's dependency injection (if it's intended to be a Spring bean). 3. Added simple errors logging and immediate throw if preconditions are not met (like file existence). 4. Simplified the process output reading loop. The result is that the CSV files should be created immediately by \`ssconvert\` as the Java process waits (\`process.waitFor()\`) for \`ssconvert\` to complete. If files are still delayed despite these changes, confirm that the behavior is not the same when running \`ssconvert\` directly from the command line outside the context of your Java application.

This means the CSV files should be created immediately once \`ssconvert\` finishes its execution. Here's the logic of \`runSSConvertCommand\` broken down: 1. Build the command string to convert the Excel file into multiple CSV files, one for each sheet. 2. Start the process using the \`ProcessBuilder\`. 3. Redirect the process error stream to the standard output for unified processing. 4. Start reading the process input stream immediately (which includes error stream due to redirection). 5. Wait for the process to complete with \`process.waitFor()\`. 6. Process any output lines, filter out blank lines, and get the status from \`SsConverter\`. 7. Return the \`ConversionStatus\`.

SsConverter.ConversionStatus.SUCCESS : SsConverter.ConversionStatus.FAILURE; } \`\`\` Make sure to adapt the return value to match the \`ConversionStatus\` enum in your \`SsConverter\` class. If you continue to encounter issues, debug or log output to ensure that the code is reaching \`process.waitFor()\` and that this call is completing as expected. Check if any exceptions are thrown and caught silently. Validate by running a minimal example with the \`ssconvert\` command directly or consider alternate ways to perform file conversion if the behavior persists."},{"instruction":"How would Gendry and Arya's relationship be affected, post reunion, if he still stayed by her side even after her confessing her darkest secret, despite him being shocked.","output":"The nature of Gendry and Arya's relationship in \\"Game of Thrones\\" is complex, evolving from mutual survival-based camaraderie to a deeper emotional connection. If after their reunion in the show (or hypothetical future encounters in the books) Arya were to confess a \\"darkest secret\\" to Gendry, there are a few potential outcomes for their relationship, depending on the nature of the secret and the context. Let's imagine a scenario in which Arya reveals something deeply personal and potentially troubling to Gendry—perhaps related to her list and the killings she carried out in her quest for revenge, or her training with the Faceless Men in Braavos, including the magic and deception involved. 1. Increased Intimacy and Trust: If Gendry truly cares for Arya and understands the traumas she has endured, his staying by her side could significantly deepen their bond. Gendry's acceptance of Arya's darker nature might showcase a level of unconditional acceptance that enhances the trust between them. 2. Emotional Complexity: Gendry could be both shocked by Arya's secrets and still feel a desire to support her. His initial reaction might include a mix of confusion, fear, or even disappointment, but these feelings could eventually give way to a more nuanced understanding of Arya's past actions and current emotional state. 3. Dynamic Shift: The power dynamics in their relationship could shift if Gendry sees Arya in a new light. He might see her not just as the fierce and independent warrior that he knew, but also as someone who has been deeply affected by her experiences. This new understanding could alter how he interacts with her going forward. 4. Protective Instincts: Gendry's response might trigger protective instincts towards Arya. Even if he is initially taken aback, he might become more vigilant or concerned about Arya's well-being, knowing the psychological toll her experiences may have taken on her. 5. Moral Conflicts: Depending on what Arya confesses, Gendry might grapple with his own moral compass. If Arya's darkest secret conflicts with Gendry's values, this could create tension or conflict that they would need to address to maintain their relationship. 6. Role Reversal: Historically, Arya has often been the protector and the more assertive one in their dynamic. After her confession, Gendry might feel a need to step up and be a source of stability and support for Arya, leading him to take on a more active role in their partnership. Ultimately, how Gendry and Arya's relationship would be affected by such a revelation depends greatly on the context and character growth. However, their previous interactions suggest a foundation of mutual respect and care that could likely withstand the shock of Arya's darkest secrets and allow their relationship to continue developing in a meaningful way."},{"instruction":"注入 türkçesi nedir oyunda kullanımı","output":"\\"注入\\" kelimesi Çince'de \\"enjekte etmek\\", \\"sokmak\\" veya \\"doldurmak\\" anlamına gelir.

Please describe the scene of rescuing the girl from under the wheels of the truck.","output":"**Title:** The Melodies of Otherworlds Plot Overview Kazuto Yamazaki, a 17-year-old Tokyo high school student, finds his monochrome life drenched in colors after a fateful evening turns his world upside down. Following a heroic impulse to save a young girl from an impending accident, they are both whisked away to a fantastical realm riddled with magic, power struggles, and creatures of myth. In this parallel world, Kazuto discovers an ancient feud and his own latent magical abilities, which are tied to the elements of music – a magic that resonates with the heart and soul. As he and the mysterious girl, whom he learns is named Aria, navigate the dangers of this new world, a deep connection forms between them, leading to a romance that defies the laws of both worlds. But with turmoil tearing at the realms’ seams, it is up to Kazuto to learn the true meaning of strength, love, and sacrifice. Chapter 1: The Girl and the Crossing The neon buzz of Tokyo always filled the air with an electric life as the sun surrendered its hold. Kazuto Yamazaki walked the familiar route to the supermarket, lost in his own thoughts. Unlike the typical overachieving protagonists in stories he enjoyed, he was decidedly ordinary. His grades were middling at best, and his dreams existed only in the vague hope of one day finding something extraordinary. Kazuto pushed through the sliding doors, grabbing a basket. A quick glance at his phone confirmed what he needed: eggs, milk, some instant noodles, and—if the sale was still on—his favorite brand of soy sauce. It was a banal task, the sort that reinforced how mundane his life was. On his way out, arms laden with plastic bags, the frigid night air was a slap to his cheeks. He hummed a tune under his breath, a habit he had when winding down from the day’s monotony. It was then, as he waited for the pedestrian signal to turn green, that he saw her. She was a wisp of a thing, no older than twelve, with hair that shimmered like spun silver under the streetlights. But her face was streaked with tears, her expression one of unheard despair. Kazuto felt a twinge in his chest, distinct and jarring amid his habitual numbness. The signal chimed, and he took a step, ready to walk on, but something in her demeanor made him hesitate. He watched as she stepped off the curb, her eyes hollow and unfocused, directly into the path of an oncoming truck. Time folded like paper. \\"No!\\" Kazuto’s voice was a distant sound to his own ears. His feet acted of their own accord, basket dropping, as he lunged forward into the street. Adrenaline commanded his limbs. The world narrowed to the girl, the truck, and the desperate hope that he wasn't too late. His hand grasped her arm, yanking her back with all the force his panicked body could muster. The wail of brakes squealed a discordant symphony as the truck swerved. Kazuto felt the hot rush of wind as the behemoth of metal grazed past, barely a hair's breadth from them. They tumbled to the ground, a heap of limbs and heartbeat. The bags of groceries lay strewn across the pavement, eggs shattered, milk flowing into the gutter like an ironic river of life. Kazuto's breath came in heavy gasps as he looked at the girl. Her wide eyes met his, the same shade as a clear winter sky, and in that instant, a foreign warmth engulfed them—a sensation overbearing and tranquil at once. The cacophony of Tokyo’s rush hour dimmed, and Kazuto’s ears were filled with a melody that seemed plucked from the stars themselves; a sweet, haunting tune that seemed to beckon them. The dissonance of screeching metal and frantic voices faded to nothingness, and the reality they knew bent, shimmered, and snapped. The fragrance of jasmine and the rustle of unseen leaves greeted them as they found themselves no longer on the cold concrete of Shinjuku, but on the plush green of an otherworldly forest. Violet skies stretched above them, and the cry of unfamiliar birds echoed in the distance. \\"Where are we?\\" The girl's voice was a whisper picked up by the swirling, mystic wind. \\"I—I don't know,\\" Kazuto managed to say, his mind reeling. He looked at the girl once more, and understanding dawned upon him that she was no simple child. There was an ageless knowing behind her youthful gaze. \\"Who are you?\\" \\"My name is Aria,\\" she said, a tremor in her voice. \\"And you…\\" She paused, taking in the sight of him—the ordinary boy from a world much different from this. \\"You saved me.\\" \\"Yeah, I guess I did.\\" Kazuto's words hung in the air, laced with disbelief. He had hoped for something extraordinary, but this? This was beyond the boundaries of his simplest imagination. \\"You've brought us to the Ancients' Forest,\\" Aria spoke again. \\"Only those with a powerful destiny can come here—the destiny of intertwining worlds.\\" Kazuto looked around, taking in the beauty, the alien charm of their environment, and for the first time in his life, he wondered if ordinary was just the beginning of an unwritten legend. Here, holding the hand of a mystical girl with tears still gently tracing her cheeks, magic didn't feel like such a far-off dream."},{"instruction":"导出数据库表和数据的命令","output":"导出数据库表结构和数据通常是指将数据库中的表及其数据转储到文件中，以便在其他地方进行恢复或备份。常用数据库系统如MySQL和PostgreSQL都提供了用于这项任务的工具。 1.

The symptoms of COVID-19 caused by the Kraken variant have been generally similar to those caused by other Omicron subvariants. These symptoms can vary from person to person and can range from mild to severe, including: 1. Fever or chills 2. Cough 3. Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing 4. Fatigue 5. Muscle or body aches 6. Headache 7. New loss of taste or smell (though less common with Omicron subvariants than with earlier strains) 8. Sore throat 9. Congestion or runny nose 10. Nausea or vomiting 11. Diarrhea However, the Omicron variants, including XBB.1.5, have often been associated with upper respiratory symptoms and seem to be more likely to spare the lungs compared to previous variants like Delta, leading to less severe disease in many cases, especially among vaccinated individuals. It's important to note that with the evolution of the virus, the presentation of symptoms and their severity could change. People who are fully vaccinated and boosted often have milder symptoms than those who are unvaccinated. For the most accurate and up-to-date information on COVID-19 symptoms and the specifics of the Kraken variant, you should consult reputable sources such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), or official public health advisories in your region."},{"instruction":"Can Kraken cause loss of appetite?","output":"Yes, Kraken, like other COVID-19 variants, can potentially cause a loss of appetite. Loss of appetite is a common symptom that can occur due to various illnesses, including viral infections like COVID-19. This symptom may accompany other symptoms such as fever, fatigue, and gastrointestinal issues that can contribute to reduced food intake. If you or someone else is experiencing a loss of appetite combined with other COVID-19 symptoms, it's essential to follow public health guidelines, consider getting tested for COVID-19, and consult a healthcare provider for proper advice and treatment if necessary. As guidance and understanding of the virus may change over time, always refer to the latest health authority recommendations for the most current information."},{"instruction":"How long can last loss of appetite during COVID 19 kraken version?","output":"The duration of symptoms, including loss of appetite, during a COVID-19 infection, such as with the \\"Kraken\\" variant (XBB.1.5), can vary widely among individuals. For most people, acute symptoms of COVID-19, including loss of appetite, typically last for a couple of days to a week or two. Some people may experience a quicker recovery, with symptoms resolving in just a few days, while others may have symptoms that last longer. In some instances, individuals may develop post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), often referred to as \\"long COVID,\\" where symptoms, including loss of appetite, persist or recur for weeks or even months after the initial infection. It is essential to monitor symptoms and seek medical advice if they are severe, worsen, or persist. Factors like underlying health conditions, vaccination status, and the overall immune response to the infection can influence the duration and severity of symptoms.

His black school uniform was neat but nondescript, just like him—a single brushstroke in a canvas crowded with color. Kazuto's life, thus far, was a quiet soliloquy on the ordinary; his grades were decent, he had a few friends, and his greatest challenge was simply getting through the day unnoticed. However, on this fateful evening, a vague premonition tugged at the edges of his consciousness as he pushed the heavy glass doors of the supermarket, the gentle chime mocking the silent chaos about to unfold. As Kazuto perused the aisles, his focus on mundane selections—a carton of milk, a loaf of bread—a soft whimpering startled his quiet contemplation. Turning towards the sound, his eyes landed on a petite girl standing alone by the sweets section, her small frame trembling, silent tears streaming down her face. Clad in a simple, frayed dress, with shining silver hair cascading down her back, she seemed to cling to an otherworldly charm. Kazuto glanced around, but no one else appeared to notice her distress. A pang of empathy tightened his chest. His feet moved before his mind could protest, bringing him to her side. \\"Hey, are you okay?\\" Kazuto asked gently, unsure of how to comfort a crying child. The girl, startled, looked up with wide, violet eyes that seemed too deep for her youth—eyes that whispered of loss and solitude—and then, just as suddenly, she dashed towards the exit, the bells of her laughter lost in the hum of the evening crowd. Kazuto shook his head, a confusing mix of worry and curiosity stirring within him. After paying for his groceries, he hurried out of the supermarket, half-expecting the little girl to be gone. Yet, there she was, standing on the edge of the sidewalk, oblivious to the dangers that whirled around her. In that heartbeat, a reckless driver, face alight with the pale blue of a cellphone screen, barreled down the road—a heavy truck unforgiving in its momentum. The girl, lost in her sorrow, took a forlorn step forward into the red light, prompted by some invisible call. \\"Look out!\\" Kazuto's voice was a thunderclap, cutting through the city's cacophony as he sprinted forward. Time stretched and yawned, the world slipping into slow motion as his hand clutched the girl's arm, yanking her back with adrenaline-born strength. The truck's horn blared a warning unheeded, as it whistled past, a mere whisper away from tragedy. The crowd gasped and murmured, but to Kazuto, it was as if they were submerged underwater—every sound muffled, every movement languorous. The girl clung to him, her breath coming in hitched sobs, her tears warm against his skin. \\"Why...?\\" Kazuto panted, heart thundering in his chest. \\"You could have been killed!\\" The girl gazed up at him, her eyes an enigmatic abyss, shimmering with a thousand unspoken thoughts. \\"Because,\\" she uttered in a voice tinged with an accent that danced on the brink of familiarity and fantasy, \\"I thought it might take me back. I was wrong.\\" \\"Take you back? Back where?\\" The questions slipped from Kazuto's lips, his breath catching as the girl's tears glowed with an ethereal light. Suddenly, the world around them fractured. Like shards of broken glass, reality splintered, each piece reflecting a different hue of impossibility. Kazuto gripped the girl tighter as the supermarket, the crowd, the honking cars all dissolved into a vortex of streaming light. The transition was without pain, but not without terror. With the girl as his anchor, Kazuto fell through the swirling colors, his mind unable to grasp the impossible, yet undeniable transport to another realm. When the spinning stopped, they stood in an idyllic glade, the air fragrant with flowers unknown to either of them. \\"This is...?\\" Kazuto's query died on his lips as he beheld the towering trees and the sky bleeding into twilight, with twin moons rising like silent guardians. \\"Welcome to Estoria,\\" the girl whispered, her voice soft as the seraphic breeze. \\"I am Aeliana. And you, Kazuto Yamazaki, have just saved my life—and crossed worlds.\\" Kazuto's knees threatened to buckle, his mind a tempest of disbelief and awe. Caught between two realities, he realized that his ordinary life had been irrevocably ensnared in the extraordinary. And at the heart of it all was Aeliana—a girl enshrouded in magic, whose mysterious past and tearful crossing of worlds beckoned him into an uncertain fate, one threaded with danger, enchantment, and the unlikeliest of romances."},{"instruction":"Create some content for following topic in powerpoint format: \\"Alternative text for social media\\".","output":"Since I can't create an actual PowerPoint presentation here, I'll outline what a presentation on \\"Alternative Text for Social Media\\" might include, slide-by-slide.

Create a guidance document for the following topic: “Alternative text for social media”. You are free to use your own points but ensure it contains at least the following details: 1. Definition of alt text 2. Examples 3. Guidance 4. Best practices 5. Describing data-rich images 6. Screen reader and emoji 7. Examples of how to write alt text 8. Do's and Don't for alt text","output":"# Alternative Text for Social Media: A Comprehensive Guide --- Introduction This guide provides an understanding of the purpose, application, and best practices for alternative text (alt text) in social media content. Alt text is a critical component of digital accessibility, ensuring that visual media is inclusive and consumable by all audiences, particularly those who use assistive technologies like screen readers. --- 1. Definition of Alt Text **Alt text** (alternative text), also known as \\"alt attributes\\" or \\"alt descriptions,\\" is a written copy that appears in place of an image on a webpage if the image fails to load. More importantly, alt text is used by screen readers, software that reads digital text aloud, to describe images to users who are visually impaired. --- 2. Examples - A photo of a dog playing fetch would have alt text: \\"A brown Labrador retriever joyfully catching a red frisbee in the park.\\" - A picture of a graph showing company growth would include: \\"Line graph displaying significant company growth from Q1 to Q4 with profits increasing by 50%.\\" --- 3. Guidance - Descriptive and Concise: Alt text should accurately describe the image's content and function. - Contextually Relevant: It should be relevant to the accompanying text and align with the content's intent. - Avoid Redundancy: Don’t repeat the same information given in the text near the image. --- 4. Best Practices - Be Specific: Clearly describe objects and actions in the image. - Limit Length: Alt text should typically be no longer than 125 characters. - Non-Text Content: Ensure that charts, maps, and diagrams have descriptive alt text that conveys the same information as the image. --- 5. Describing Data-Rich Images For complex images like infographics: - Provide a short summary as alt text. - Include a longer description nearby, or provide a link to a full text alternative. - Example Alt Text: \\"Infographic detailing steps of sustainable recycling practices, full description in link.\\" --- 6. Screen Reader and Emoji - Screen readers read emojis as text, so use them sparingly and ensure they are appropriate for the content. - Example: The clapping hands emoji would be read by a screen reader as \\"clapping hands sign.\\" --- 7. Examples of How to Write Alt Text **Good Alt Text:** - \\"A beach during sunset with orange hues reflecting off the calm waters.\\" - \\"Stacked bar chart comparing monthly sales of products A, B, and C.\\" **Poor Alt Text:** - \\"Image\\" or \\"Photo.\\" - \\"Screen shot.\\" - Overly detailed text that overwhelms with unnecessary information. --- 8. Do's and Don'ts for Alt Text **Do's:** - Do describe the meaning and content conveyed by the image. - Do mention color if it’s important to the content. - Do use keywords organically that aid in content discovery. **Don'ts:** - Don't use \\"image of,\\" \\"picture of,\\" etc., as screen reading software indicates an image is present. - Don't stuff keywords, as this can be confusing and misleading. - Don't provide alt text for images that are purely decorative; instead, use an empty alt attribute (alt=\\"\\") if required by the HTML. --- Conclusion Effective alt text writing enhances the accessibility of social media content, providing visually impaired users with a richer, more inclusive web experience. By following these guidelines, you contribute to a more accessible digital environment for everyone. Additionally, incorporating alt text aligns with legal standards and boosts your content's SEO performance. Should you have further questions, or need specific advice about implementing these practices, feel free to reach out to accessibility experts or relevant online communities dedicated to digital inclusivity."},{"instruction":"Expand each section and provide examples wherever applicable.","output":"# Alternative Text for Social Media: A Comprehensive Guide --- Introduction Visual content dominates our digital experience, particularly on social media. However, not everyone can interact with visual media in the same way. For users with visual impairments, images can present a barrier to the full enjoyment and understanding of content on the web. Implementing alternative text (alt text) effectively can bridge this gap, ensuring an inclusive experience for all users. --- 1. Definition of Alt Text **Alt text** is an attribute added to an image tag in HTML to provide a text alternative for search engines and users who cannot see the image. For social media, alt text serves a similar purpose—enabling content to be accessible through descriptions that screen reading software can vocalize, affording users with visual impairments an equivalent experience. --- 2. Examples - **Simple Image**: A photo of a cat sleeping might have alt text: _\\"A grey tabby cat curled up asleep on a sunny windowsill.\\"_ - **Data-Rich Image**: A bar chart showing social media engagement rates could include: _\\"Bar chart showing Instagram with the highest engagement rate at 4.5%, followed by Facebook at 2.5%, and Twitter at 1.5%.\\"_ --- 3. Guidance - Determine the function and purpose of the image within the context of the surrounding text. For example, if the image is decorative, it might not need alt text. - Use alt text to convey the same information or evoke similar emotions as the image does for sighted users. --- 4. Best Practices - **Specificity**: If the image is of a well-known landmark, \\"The Eiffel Tower on a rainy evening\\" is more informative than just \\"a tower.\\" - **Length**: Keep alt text succinct to cater to screen readers' limitations and users' attention spans. If further explanation is needed, this can be included in the main body of the text. - **Avoid Redundancy**: If the image caption or surrounding text already describes the image, provide alt text that offers additional insight or is complementary. --- 5. Describing Data-Rich Images - **Summary Alt Text for an Infographic**: _\\"A colorful infographic showing that global renewable energy use has increased by 20% in 2023 \\"_ - **Where to Place Longer Descriptions**: For detailed visuals, like infographics or charts, it is practical to have a full description either directly in the post or linked to a page with a detailed breakdown. --- 6. Screen Reader and Emoji Use emojis judiciously and where they add meaning to the message, keeping in mind that a screen reader will announce the name of the emoji aloud. For example: - Incorrect: \\"I love pizza 🍕🍕🍕!\\" - Correct: \\"I love pizza! 🍕\\" The excessive use of the same emoji can cause the screen reader to repeatedly say \\"pizza,\\" which could be jarring and confusing for the listener. --- 7. Examples of How to Write Alt Text **Contextual Alt Text**: - For a book cover used in a review post: _\\"Cover of 'Where the Crawdads Sing,' featuring a painting of a girl in a canoe amidst marshland.\\"_ - For a company's team photo: _\\"The XYZ Corp team smiling in the company's lobby, holding the 'Best Innovator Award' for 2023.\\"_ **Descriptive and Informative Alt Text**: - For a how-to post showcasing a DIY project: _\\"Step-by-step images showing a hand-painted ceramic pot in teal with white polka dots.\\"_ --- 8. Do's and Don'ts for Alt Text # Do's: - **Informative**: Describe what is in the image and why it’s there. - **Equivalence**: Offer an experience similar to seeing the image. - **Keywords**: When appropriate, use relevant keywords to aid discovery through search engines. # Don'ts: - **Decorative Images**: Do not add alt text to images that don't add informative content (alt=\\"\\"). - **Over-description**: Avoid excessively lengthy descriptions that can be tedious for the user. - **Assumptions**: Describe what is visible without assuming its significance or making interpretations. --- Conclusion In our increasingly digital world, the importance of accessible content cannot be overstated. By using alt text thoughtfully, you can create an inclusive social media presence that welcomes all audiences. Not only are these efforts socially responsible, but they can also improve your reach and standing in search engine results, due to better SEO. Accessibility is a journey and an ongoing commitment to learning and improving. By following the guidance in this document, you will be taking significant steps toward a more inclusive social media space. For further advice or personal consultation on accessibility practices, consider reaching out to digital inclusion experts and advocacy groups.

Your efforts make a difference."},{"instruction":"Expand the \\"Do’s and Don’ts for Alt Text\\" even further.","output":"Do’s and Don’ts for Alt Text **Do’s:** 1. **Keep it Relevant**: Use alt text that relates directly to the image's content and purpose. Alt text should enhance understanding for those who cannot see the image. - **Do:** \\"CEO Jane Doe presenting the new product line at the 2023 Tech Innovators Conference.\\" - **Do not:** \\"A person standing by a presentation screen.\\" 2. **Focus on Functionality**: If the image is being used as a button or link, ensure the alt text describes the action that will occur when the image is selected. - **Do:** \\"Submit button.\\" - **Do not:** \\"Green circle.\\" 3. **Be Descriptive for Informative Images**: When images carry information, such as graphs or tables, make sure the alt text relays that information effectively. - **Do:** \\"Pie chart showing 60% market share for Acme Inc.\\" - **Do not:** \\"Chart with different colors.\\" 4. **Use Keywords Purposefully**: Incorporate relevant keywords that align with the image and the content for better SEO without overdoing it. - **Do:** \\"Veterinarian performing a checkup on a golden retriever puppy.\\" - **Do not:** \\"Dog vet puppy golden retriever health checkup care clinic.\\" 5. **Keep it Succinct**: Maintain a concise structure while being descriptive, aiming for alt text that is around 125 characters or slightly more if necessary. - **Do:** \\"Woman practicing yoga on the beach at sunrise, forming a silhouetted warrior pose.\\" - **Do not:** \\"A person is outside in the early morning with the sun coming up over the horizon, standing on the sand by the water and doing a common yoga pose that looks like warrior stance.\\" 6. **Add Context Where Applicable**: Sometimes, the context in which the image is used may affect the alt text description. - **Do:** \\"Infographic timeline detailing the company's history over the last 50 years.\\" - **Do not:** \\"Line with dates and text.\\" 7. **Alt Text for Emojis**: When using emojis, write alt text that conveys the same sentiment or mood they add to the message. - **Do:** \\"Excited face emoji.\\" - **Do not:** \\"Yellow round icon.\\" **Don’ts:** 1. **Skip Alt Text for Important Content**: Never omit alt text for images that provide content or function; this ensures accessibility for users with visual impairments. - **Do not:** Leave important images without alt text. - **Do:** Provide alt text for all non-decorative images. 2. **Recreate the Surrounding Text**: Avoid repeating the same information in the alt text that's already present in the text surrounding the image. - **Do not:** \\"Photo of a dog\\" when the caption already explains the image. - **Do:** Provide additional or complementary information if necessary. 3. **Overuse Keywords**: Keyword stuffing can make alt text unreadable and can also negatively impact your site's SEO. - **Do not:** Insert multiple keywords in an attempt to manipulate search engine rankings. - **Do:** Use relevant keywords organically to describe the image. 4. **Be Vague or Non-Descriptive**: Ensure alt text gives the user a clear understanding of the image content. - **Do not:** \\"A thing on a thing.\\" - **Do:** \\"A smartphone resting on a wooden desk next to a potted plant.\\" 5. **Create Long alt-text**: Excessively long descriptions can overwhelm and frustrate users who depend on screen readers. - **Do not:** Write extensive narratives that are inconvenient for quick browsing. - **Do:** Stay succinct while conveying the necessary information. 6. **Describe Decorative Images**: If an image is purely decorative and doesn't add to the content, it's often best to use an empty alt attribute. This prevents unnecessary verbosity for screen reader users. - **Do not:** \\"Decorative border.\\" - **Do:** Use an empty alt attribute (alt=\\"\\") for images that are strictly for visual decoration. 7. **Assume the User's Perspective**: Avoid using subjective language or assumptions about what the user may perceive. - **Do not:** \\"An inspiring image of a sunrise.\\" - **Do:** \\"Sunrise over the mountains with a red and orange sky.\\" By adhering to these expanded do's and don'ts for alt text, you will create more accessible and engaging social media content that serves a wider audience and complies with best practices for inclusivity online."},{"instruction":"Provide some guidance with respect to word limit for alt text.","output":"When writing alt text, it's essential to balance descriptiveness with brevity. Alt text should be concise but informative enough to convey the purpose and content of the image to someone who cannot see it. Here are some specific guidelines regarding the word limit for alt text: # Recommended Length - **Keep It Short**: Aim for alt text that is typically between 100-125 characters. This length is generally sufficient to describe an image meaningfully while being concise. # Why There's a Limit - **Screen Reader Compatibility**: Some screen readers cut off alt text at around 125 characters, so important information may not be conveyed if your alt text is significantly longer than this. - **User Experience**: Keep in mind that screen reader users often navigate through content more slowly. Longer alt text can disrupt the user experience and flow. # Writing Concise Alt Text 1. **Key Information First**: Prioritize the most critical details at the beginning of the alt text. 2. **Eliminate Redundancy**: Don’t include information that is already conveyed in the surrounding context or caption. 3. **Focus on Content**: Describe only what’s pertinent. Avoid filler words and unnecessary adjectives. 4. **Use Active Voice**: It’s usually more direct and succinct than passive voice. # When to Exceed the Limit - **Complex Images**: If an image contains crucial information that cannot be succinctly described (for example, charts, diagrams, or infographics), you might exceed the typical length. # Alternatives for Lengthy Descriptions - **Longdesc Attribute**: For HTML content, consider using the \\"longdesc\\" attribute, which allows for more extensive image descriptions. - **Supplementary Text**: If the social media platform doesn’t support extended alt text, consider adding a longer description in the post body or comment, or link to a detailed description elsewhere. # Testing and Feedback Always test your alt text with real-world users and screen readers, where possible, to ensure that it is adequately informative and appropriately concise. Additionally, seek feedback from the community of users who depend on alt text for a better understanding of what works best. # Final Tips - Practice makes perfect. Regularly write alt text to better understand the balance between conciseness and descriptiveness. - Stay updated with guidelines from platforms and accessibility standards as they evolve and may alter best practices for alt text length and usage. By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your alt text serves its purpose effectively without being too verbose or falling short of conveying the full scope of the image."},{"instruction":"Я сейчас напомню тебе диалог: Пользователь: Напиши сценарий для видео на катке Ты: Конечно, вот примерный сценарий для видео, проводимого на катке:<br/><br/>—<br/><br/><strong>Название видео</strong>: Волшебная зима на коньках<br/><br/><strong>Вступление</strong>:<br/>- Видеоматериал: Кадры катка, людей, которые весело катаются на коньках, украшения вокруг катка.<br/>- Голос за кадром: “Зима – это время чудес, а каток – место, где они оживают.

The evening buzz of the city served as a lullaby to the mundane routine that chronicled his high school life. With tousled black hair and eyes the color of the darkened overcast, he embodied the portrait of an average student lost amidst the urban tapestry. He wore his detachment like a shield, blending seamlessly into the crowds that ebbed and flowed around him. The fluorescent lights of the local supermarket gave off a sterile sheen, illuminating rows of neatly stacked produce and the mundane task at hand—grocery shopping. Averting his gaze from a stray reflection in the glass doors, Kazuto strode in with a sigh. The list his mother gave him lay folded in his pocket, an inventory of necessities devoid of excitement. As he exited, a frigid gust welcomed him, and his tepid heart offered no resistance. It was then that the sharp sound of sobs disrupted the monotonous drone of the city. Across the pavement, a girl with pale skin, cerulean eyes, and locks of raven cascading over her shoulders stood weeping. She couldn't have been older than twelve, garbed in what seemed like an oddly elaborate, frilly gown that flowed over her frail form—an anachronism amongst the urban sprawl. Compelled by innate concern, Kazuto approached, but fate cruelly expedited their meeting. A gasp snagged at his throat as she stepped off the curb, her tear-glossed eyes blind to the red light she challenged with childish ignorance. \\"Watch out!\\" he barked, voice slicing through the drone of urban noise. Time's rhythm faltered, choking on the heartbeat he sacrificed as he launched forward. The world blurred to a streak of motion, with only her horror-stricken face in limpid clarity. His body collided with hers, a desperate shield before the roaring might of the oncoming truck. Their entwined figures tumbled in an impossible suspension of reality, ensnared in a swirling vortex of twilight energy. It swathed around them—a spectral ribbon—and distanced them from the laws of the natural world. The plaintive wail of the truck became a distant echo, the pervasive hum of the city a fading whisper. In an ethereal embrace, they spiraled, as if carried aloft by a tempest of stars, before everything fell hush. Kazuto's senses swam back from the precipice of oblivion. He peeled his lids open, inhaling sharply. The air had metamorphosed; it was brisk, carrying the scent of pine and a whisper of inexplicable magic. The sensation of asphalt had been replaced by soft grass, the urban kaleidoscope usurped by the vast expanse of an alien sky, blazing with hues of a sunset he had only ever glimpsed in dreams. \\"What…?\\" Kazuto's voice fractured the stillness, a cracked whisper. The girl disentangled herself, wide-eyed awe substituting her distress. \\"Where are we?\\" she quivered, a mellifluous hint to her voice—one that didn't belong to the world he knew. He propped himself on his elbows, scoping the panorama of undulating meadows, majestic forests, and mountains that clawed at the very fabric of the heavens above. \\"I—I don't know.\\" \\"Did we… die?\\" she mused aloud, unmarred innocence coloring her question. \\"No, we're very much alive,\\" Kazuto asserted, though his conviction wavered against the foreign tableau. Quirking his head, he observed her: she was a paradox, a child cloaked in the regalia of antiquated royalty, yet possessing eyes that seemed eons older. Her presence was a curious brushstroke on this canvas of mystique. \\"I'm Kazuto… Yamazaki,\\" he introduced, grappling with this fractured slice of reality. \\"I am Princess Aeliana of Elaris,\\" she announced with a poise that stitched a contrast to her former vulnerability. \\"It seems we've been whisked away to another world.\\" \\"A parallel world…\\" Kazuto murmured, his disbelief suspended in the quivering air. Aeliana looked up at him, her gaze tethered to his. \\"You saved me… Thank you, Kazuto of Tokyo.\\" He blinked, an inexplicable warmth kindling within. It threatened to melt the frost in his veins—frost that had thwarted every attempt at drama or romance in his life until now. As the first stars of this foreign night pricked the burgeoning dusk, the two found themselves unmoored from everything they once knew. But within the web of magic and serendipity that engulfed them, they were far from alone. Together, they stood at the threshold of an odyssey—a tale of isekai, magic, and the entwining of fates. The novelty of the drama before them promised a narrative dense with romance and spectacle—a story untraveled and utterly their own."},{"instruction":"если материальные точки связаны нитью что у них общего","output":"Если материальные точки связаны нерастяжимой и невесомой нитью, то у них есть несколько общих характеристик, основанных на законах физики: 1. **Одинаковая скорость движения по нити**: Поскольку нить нерастяжима, все точки на ней будут перемещаться с одинаковой скоростью вдоль нити. Это значит, что если одна из точек начнет двигаться или менять свою скорость, другая точка также изменит свою скорость одновременно, чтобы сохранить натяжение нити. 2. **Сохранение натяжения нити**: Нить, соединяющая две материальные точки, будет испытывать натяжение, которое будет одинаковым по всей её длине (если пренебречь массой нити). Это натяжение представляет силовое взаимодействие между двумя точками. 3. **Ограниченное движение**: Движение материальных точек ограничено длиной нити. Точки не могут удаляться друг от друга на расстояние, большее чем длина нити. 4. **Сохранение взаимного расположения**: При движении материальные точки сохраняют своё взаимное расположение друг к другу. То есть они будут находиться на одной линии, проходящей через обе точки и направлении нити. 5. **Взаимодействие через силы натяжения**: В каждой точке, где на материальные точки действует нить, будет приложена сила натяжения, исходящая от другой точки. Эта сила определяется вторым законом Ньютона и зависит от массы точки, её ускорения и других приложенных сил. 6. **Законы сохранения**: Для такой системы будут справедливы законы сохранения импульса и энергии (если нет внешних сил или если их вклад можно не учитывать). Это значит, что общий импульс системы и общая механическая энергия сохранятся, если внешние силы не совершают работы или их влияние можно не учесть. В задачах классической механики часто используют упрощение, представляя тела как материальные точки и связывая их нерастяжимыми нитями, чтобы упростить анализ."},{"instruction":"Если первая материальная точка может двигаться только вертикально, вторая только горизонтально, они связаны невесомой нерастяжимой нитью под углом 45 градусов, что у них общего","output":"Когда две материальные точки соединены невесомой нерастяжимой нитью под углом 45 градусов, и одна движется только вертикально, а другая только горизонтально, они имеют несколько общих характеристик в рамках классической механики: 1. Связь движений: Движения точек связаны друг с другом через нить. Это означает, что перемещение одной точки неизбежно приводит к соответствующему перемещению другой точки. 2. Скорость компонентов: Если одна точка перемещается вертикально с определенной скоростью, другая точка должна перемещаться с той же скоростью в горизонтальной плоскости, чтобы сохранять нерастяжимость нити. 3. Общее ускорение: Обе точки будут иметь ускорения в своих соответствующих направлениях (вертикальное и горизонтальное), значения которых связаны между собой соотношением, определенным углом наклона нити. 4. Сохранение энергии: Если система изолирована, общая механическая энергия системы будет сохраняться, что включает кинетическую энергию обеих точек и потенциальную энергию системы, если учесть влияние гравитации. 5. Величина натяжения: Натяжение нити будет одинаково для обеих материальных точек, так как это сила, которая передается через невесомую и нерастяжимую нить. 6. Ограничение степеней свободы: Несмотря на то что две точки могут двигаться только вдоль перпендикулярных осей (вертикальной и горизонтальной), наличие нерастяжимой нити ограничивает их степени свободы, так как они не могут перемещаться независимо друг от друга. Из этих общих характеристик следует, что когда одна точка движется, вторая также будет двигаться таким образом, чтобы нить сохраняла свою длину и угол в 45 градусов относительно горизонтали и вертикали. Это создает уникальную связь между вертикальным и горизонтальным движениями в данной системе."},{"instruction":"i had made a youtube video on crispy aloo tikki ragda chaat make a catchy strong hook intro and outro for my video in hinglish but in hindi font","output":"Intro: \\"नमस्कार दोस्तों! आज हम लेकर आए हैं स्ट्रीट फूड का तड़का, वो भी आपके किचन से! क्या आप तैयार हैं आलू टिक्की रगड़ा चाट की क्रंचीनेस और फ्लेवर्स का मजा लेने के लिए? तो फिर बने रहिए मेरे साथ, क्योंकि ये रेसिपी आपको अपने हाथों को चाटने पर मजबूर कर देगी! तो चलिए, शुरू करते हैं इस चटपटे सफर को, जहाँ आप जानेंगे कि घर पे बनाए कैसे सबसे क्रिस्पी और स्वादिष्ट आलू टिक्की रगड़ा चाट। चलिए, शुरू करते हैं!\\" Outro: \\"तो दोस्तों, कैसी लगी आपको हमारी क्रिस्पी आलू टिक्की रगड़ा चाट की रेसिपी? मज़ा आया ना? अगर आपको ये वीडियो पसंद आया हो, तो लाइक और शेयर तो बनता ही है, साथ ही अगर आपने अब तक चैनल सब्सक्राइब नहीं किया है, तो सब्सक्राइब बटन दबाना न भूलें। और हाँ, अपनी मनपसंद चटपटी चाट के बारे में हमें कमेंट सेक्शन में जरूर बताएं। फिर मिलेंगे एक नयी रेसिपी के साथ, तब तक के लिए खाते रहिए, पकाते रहिए और खुश रहिए। बाय-बाय!\\""},{"instruction":"more easy to connect local people","output":"Intro: \\"क्या हाल चाल है मेरे प्यारे दोस्तों? आज हम धमाल मचाने वाले हैं अपनी पसंदीदा देसी स्टाइल वाली चाट के साथ। जी हाँ भाइयो और बहनो, आज हम बनाएंगे चटपटी, कुरकुरी, और सबकी फेवरेट 'क्रिस्पी आलू टिक्की रगड़ा चाट' - वो भी बिलकुल आसानी से। तो जुड़े रहिये मेरे साथ और देखते हैं इस मजेदार और स्वादिष्ट रेसिपी को। चलिए, शुरू करते हैं अपनी इस गली की चाट पार्टी!\\" Outro: \\"अरे वाह दोस्तों, बन गई ना सुपरहिट रेसिपी? मुझे उम्मीद है कि ये क्रिस्पी आलू टिक्की और चटपटा रगड़ा आपको बहुत पसंद आया होगा। अगर आपको ये वीडियो अच्छा लगा हो, तो लाइक करना मत भूलना, और हां, शेयर भी करना ताकि और लोग भी इस स्वाद का मज़ा ले सकें। और आपके कोई सुझाव या अनुभव हों तो कमेंट बॉक्स में झिझक मत करना। सब्सक्राइब करना न भूलें क्योंकि ऐसी दिलचस्प रेसिपीज़ आपको और भी बहुत सारी देखने को मिलेंगी। तो फिर चलता हूँ, लेकिन जल्दी ही लौटूंगा एक नया ज़ायका लेकर। तब तक के लिए अपने और अपनों का ख्याल रखिए, खूब खाइए और मज़े कीजिए। ढेर सारा प्यार, अलविदा!\\""},{"instruction":"more","output":"Intro \\"आओ साथियों, गपशप का दौर लगाएं और अपनी चाट का मज़ा दोगुना करें! हम लेकर आए हैं आपके लिए वो रेसिपी जो आपके मूड को खुशनुमा बना देगी, और वो है हमारी 'स्वाद गली' से सीधा आपके किचेन तक 'क्रिस्पी आलू टिक्की रगड़ा चाट'। तो चलो, दोस्तों, अपने हाथों को गरमा-गरम चाट से चाटने के तैयारी कर लो, क्योंकि आज हम बनायेंगे चाट का वो सम्राट जो आपके दिन को बना देगा सुपर हिट!\\" Outro \\"बहुत बढ़िया! अब जब आपने क्रिस्पी आलू टिक्की रगड़ा चाट की रेसिपी देख ली है, तो क्यों न अपने दिल की भावनाएं इस चाट के मुख्य इंग्रेडिएंट की तरह मसालेदार बनाई जाएं? इसे बनाइये, खाइये, और जो प्यार महसूस करें उसे लाइक, शेयर करके बाँट लीजिए। और हाँ, अपनी बात, अपने सवाल हमें नीचे कमेंट में लिख भेजिए। अगर आप चाहते हैं कि ऐसी ही मजेदार और चटपटी रेसिपीज़ आप तक पहुंचती रहें, तो इस चैनल को सब्सक्राइब करना न भूलें। फिर मिलेंगे, अगले वीडियो में, लेकिन तब तक आप ये चाट ट्राय कीजिए, और बताइए कि ये आपको कैसी लगी। ध्यान रखें, मिलते हैं जल्दी ही। बहुत-बहुत प्यार, चलते चलते नमस्कार!\\""},{"instruction":"make another in different way","output":"Intro \\"आज का दिन है कुछ खास, क्योंकि हम लाए हैं तड़के की बात, और वो है गलियों का छुपा रुस्तम, पुरानी दिल्ली का फेमस आलू टिक्की वाला स्वाद, घर बैठे! तो अपनी चटनियाँ रख लें तैयार, क्योंकि आज हम बनाने वाले हैं एक सुपर चटपटी 'आलू टिक्की रगड़ा चाट'। दोस्तों, ये वो फ्लेवर है जिसके लिए ना जाने लोग कितनी दूर से आते हैं, पर आज इसे बनाने की जुगाड़ हम आपके घर लेकर आ गए हैं। तो जुड़ जाइए मेरे साथ और उठा लीजिए इस लज़ीज़ चाट का आनंद!\\" Outro \\"और लीजिए दोस्तों, आपने देख लिया कैसे हैंडल करते हैं खुद को जब जी करे चाट का। मैं तो कहूँगा कि आलू टिक्की रगड़ा चाट सिर्फ एक डिश नहीं, बल्कि एक इमोशन है। तो अगर आपके भी इमोशन जाग गए हों, तो वीडियो को एक बड़ा सा लाइक देना, और शेयर करना मत भूलिएगा। किसी भी सवाल या फीडबैक के लिए कमेंट बॉक्स हमेशा खुला है। और हाँ, ऐसी और भी दमदार रेसिपीज़ पाने के लिए चैनल को सब्सक्राइब ज़रूर कर लें। तो फिर मिलते हैं एक नए वीडियो में, नए टेस्ट और नई कहानियों के साथ। तब तक के लिए हंसते रहिए, खाते रहिए, मस्त रहिए। प्यार के साथ, अलविदा!\\""},{"instruction":"Определите тип матрицы","output":"Для того чтобы определить тип матрицы, мне нужны её элементы и размерность.

For a very rough estimate, consider a simplified two-step approach: estimating the CO2 emissions from the production of the electronic device and then understanding the emissions associated with the recycling process. 1. **Estimate CO2 Emissions from Production**: Electronics manufacturing is energy-intensive, involving the extraction and processing of raw materials, transportation, assembly, and distribution. The carbon footprint can vary widely based on these factors. You can use a figure from a lifecycle analysis (LCA) study specific to the type of electronics you're considering. For example, the production of a smartphone might be associated with roughly 50-80 kg of CO2 (this figure can vary widely based on the model and study). 2. **Estimate CO2 Emissions from Recycling**: Recycling also requires energy to collect, transport, and process the old devices into raw materials. However, it is generally considered less energy-intensive compared to manufacturing new products due to the energy savings from not having to refine and process virgin materials. Let's say recycling a smartphone might save 70% of the emissions compared to manufacturing a new one. Now, if you have a specific weight of electronics, you would scale these figures according to the weight. **Rough Calculation Example**: Let's assume each kg of new electronics manufactured results in 60 kg CO2 (using an average, though specific devices will vary drastically). Recycling the same kg of electronics may save 70% of those emissions. Here's how you might do a rough estimation: 1. Emissions from manufacturing new electronics: 60 kg CO2/kg of electronic 2. Potential savings from recycling: 60 kg * 70% = 42 kg CO2/kg of electronic 3. If the electronics are reused, you can consider that the emissions from recycling are avoided, so your savings are the same as the potential savings from recycling. So, for each kilogram of electronics you reuse instead of recycling, you might estimate that you save approximately 42 kg of CO2. Remember, this is a very rough estimate, and to get accurate figures, you would need a full lifecycle assessment for the particular devices you are looking at. It's also worth noting that reusing often extends the lifetime of a product, delaying the manufacturing of a new product, so the actual savings may be higher when considering the reduction in production demand due to reuse. Consulting specific LCA studies for the electronic items you're interested in, and adjusting for your specific context will result in a more accurate estimate of the CO2 savings from reuse over recycling."},{"instruction":"определить тип матрицы -2 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 7","output":"Матрица, представленная вами, имеет следующий вид: begin{pmatrix} -2 & 0 & 0 0 & 8 & 8 0 & 0 & 7 end{pmatrix} Для определения типа матрицы, рассмотрим её особенности: 1. Диагональная матрица: Матрица является диагональной, если все элементы вне главной диагонали равны 0. Но в данном случае это не так, поскольку во второй строке, третьем столбце есть ненулевой элемент (8). 2. Треугольная матрица: Есть два вида треугольных матриц – верхняя треугольная, где все элементы ниже главной диагонали равны 0, и нижняя треугольная, где все элементы выше главной диагонали равны 0. Поскольку все элементы ниже главной диагонали равны 0, перед нами верхняя треугольная матрица. 3. Диагонально доминирующая матрица: Матрица считается диагонально доминирующей, если модули диагональных элементов больше или равны суммы модулей всех недиагональных элементов в соответствующих строках (или столбцах). В данном случае, для второй строки это условие не выполняется, так как модуль диагонального элемента (8) меньше суммы модулей недиагональных элементов (также 8, но должен быть строго больше). 4. Скалярная матрица: Скалярная матрица является диагональной матрицей, у которой все диагональные элементы равны между собой. Это тоже не подходит к нашей матрице, так как диагональные элементы отличаются (-2, 8, 7). 5. Единичная матрица: Тип скалярной матрицы, где все диагональные элементы равны 1, и все недиагональные элементы равны 0, что снова не относится к данной матрице. 6. Нулевая матрица: Матрица, состоящая целиком из нулей, опять же не является нашим случаем. Итак, данная матрица может быть классифицирована как: - Не диагональная - Верхняя треугольная (так как все элементы ниже главной диагонали равны нулю) - Не диагонально доминирующая - Не скалярная - Не единичная - Не нулевая Таким образом, наиболее точное описание для данной матрицы - верхняя треугольная матрица."},{"instruction":"Определитель матрицы не равен нулю, если матрица Выберите один ответ: содержит нулевой столбец; имеет пропорциональные строки является единичной содержит нулевую строку","output":"Определитель матрицы не равен нулю, если матрица: является единичной Если матрица содержит нулевой столбец или нулевую строку, её определитель равен нулю, так как один из факторов при расчёте определителя будет нулём.

Instant ramen or udon for tonight? he pondered idly. Just as he reached the crosswalk adjacent to the market, a soft sob arrested his attention. There, shrinking into the shadow of the vending machines, was a girl who looked no more than twelve. A tattered ribbon clung to her hair as if it too feared to leave her alone in her grief. Kazuto felt a pang of protective instinct stir within him. Before he could act on it, the girl stumbled away from her concrete refuge on unsteady legs. Her eyes, misted with tears, missed the warning signs and the urgent glow of a red stoplight. In a fatal moment, she stepped into the street. The world seemed to pause, the chronicles of nearby lives suspended. The wail of an approaching truck, like the roar of an oncoming storm, approached. Kazuto, propelled by something ancient and fierce in his being, lunged. \\"Watch out!\\" he barked, his own voice distant in the bubble of warped time. Muscle and resolve met in an orchestrated dance as he closed the gap, reaching the girl with a breath to spare. Colliding with her, he twisted their bodies in the air just as the truck barreled past, so close he could feel its rumble through their entwined limbs. Then, in a cascade of colors and whispers, reality ripped away. The cacophony of Tokyo vanished into a vacuum of silence, replaced by an ethereal hum, like the ringing of a bell in a dream. The world morphed, the concrete jungle transmuting into an expanse of twilight-embraced wilderness under a sky painted with foreign constellations. Kazuto opened his eyes first. In his arms, in a strong embrace lay the girl he had shielded from demise's grasp. Her delicate form rose and fell with each shallow breath. Gingerly, he adjusted a lock of her chestnut hair from her porcelain cheek before whispering a silent prayer for her wellbeing. \\"Thank heavens,\\" he muttered, his breath catching with the revelation of their survival. Ascetically illuminated by a moon that seemed stolen from a poet's ode, the mysterious landscape sprawled before them—a beautiful wilderness unknown. Confusion warred with awe within him. The girl's eyelids fluttered open, revealing orbs of kaleidoscopic hazel, mirrors to a soul met with the extraordinary. As her gaze focused on Kazuto's face leaning over her, a soft gasp escaped her lips, and a rosy spread of embarrassment colored her cheeks. \\"I—uhm...\\" she stuttered, trying to gather her surroundings and the reality of a stranger's arms around her. \\"It's okay, you're safe,\\" Kazuto assured, his own voice unsteady from the whiplash of events. \\"Do you remember what happened?\\" He loosened his grip, yet didn't fully release her—uncertain if the world would remain stable if he did. \\"I...\\" She began, her voice a delicate tremor. \\"I think I was about to—\\" \\"You were in trouble, but it looks like we're both okay now.\\" Kazuto cut in, not wishing for her to relive the terror. His eyes searched the expanse around them. Trees like giant sentinels silhouetted against the sky, and the air carried an unfamiliar scent of magic. He helped her to a seated position, and they both regarded each other for a long, silent moment, two souls flung by fate into an impossible crossing of paths. \\"Where...are we?\\" she finally asked, her gaze torn between Kazuto and the alien landscape. \\"I have no idea,\\" Kazuto confessed. An ordinary boy, in a story that was anything but, trying to make sense of an 'otherworld' with no guide, beset by the burgeoning possibility of magic at his fingertips, and the stirring of a drama that would entwine his destiny with the girl who'd unintentionally become his charge. And thus, beneath an otherworldly sky, a tale of isekai, magic, romance, and drama had just begun to unfold."},{"instruction":"List obscure j-rock songs 1991-2020","output":"J-Rock, short for Japanese Rock, has a vast and eclectic scene, featuring numerous bands and artists spanning different genres and styles.

Kazuto Yamazaki is the most ordinary student in Tokyo high school. One evening, when he goes to the supermarket to buy groceries, he rescues a girl who looks about 12 years old from under the wheels of a truck. He accidentally notices this crying girl leaving the supermarket and he notices how she suddenly steps into a red traffic light without seeing or noticing anything in front of her. At that moment time seems to freeze and he and this girl move into an unfamiliar parallel world. Kazuto opened his eyes first. In his arms in a strong embrace lay the girl he saved. He looked at her beautiful face and fixing a strand of hair from her cheek he whispered to himself that thank God she was okay. The girl slowly opened her eyes and saw the face of Kazuto holding her in his arms. The girl was embarrassed and blushed a little because she was in the arms of a man she didn't know. The girl looked at Kazuto. Kazuto asked her if she was okay and if she had any pain. The girl said she was fine and asked what happened. Kazuto asked her what her name was. The girl said her name was Akari. In response, Kazuto told her his name. Please add dialog. Please describe the scene where the girl is rescued from the truck and describe their movement.

Each day bled into the next, brimming with textbooks, lectures, and the heavy weight of expectations. A high school student rooted in the extraordinariness of being utterly ordinary, Kazuto’s universe revolved around procrastinated homework and fleeting daydreams. His evenings, too, were nondescript—except on this one particular Thursday. With listlessness draped over his shoulders, Kazuto shuffled through the aisles of the local supermarket, the fluorescent bulbs casting a sterile glow over his checklist. The mundane task was interrupted as he reached the checkout line, his gaze inadvertently catching a peculiar sight of a young girl. She looked about 12, sobbing quietly in the corner, her small form hugged by shadows that seemed too dark for the colorful bright banners of the market. Curiosity nudged his concern, but it was the alarming way she darted out of the store that twisted his gut with foreboding. Her eyes, glazed with tears, seemed blind to the red stoplight that loomed ahead, and the oncoming truck that barreled towards her with anarchic indifference. It was a snapshot of horror, a silent motion picture where screams were swallowed whole. Kazuto's reflexes, fueled by a surge of adrenaline, compelled his feet forward. It wasn't a decision as much as it was a requirement of his very soul. \\"Watch out!\\" he bellowed, lunging forward. His arms encased the girl, pulling her back with a force he hadn't known resided within him. Time seemed to stutter into a standstill, as if the universe held its breath, an elongated pause where the only truth was their two beings, suspended in limbo. And then, in a twist unfathomable to the rational mind, the world fractured, a spectrum of kaleidoscopic colors flaring around them as the truck passed through the space they should've occupied. Kazuto opened his eyes first, a primal fear constricting his chest as he struggled to grasp what miracle—or madness—had saved them. In his arms, he cradled the girl, her small frame nestled against his, breathing yet unharmed. He adjusted a stray lock of her hair, tucking it behind her ear with a tenderness he didn't understand, before whispering softly, \\"Thank God, you're okay.\\" As the girl—Akari, as he would soon learn—peeled her eyes open, confusion painted her delicate features. Her cheeks flushed with the soft hue of cherry blossoms as she realized the unfamiliar closeness, the unfathomable embrace of a boy she'd never met. \\"Are you okay?\\" Kazuto asked, concern lacing his words. \\"Do you feel any pain?\\" \\"No... I'm okay,\\" Akari replied, voice wavering between relief and uncertainty. \\"What happened?\\" He helped her to sit upright, releasing her from his unintentional hold where they seemed to have landed atop a carpet of verdant grass, an endless expanse of rolling hills stretching as far as the eye could see beneath a sky of impossible colors. The transition from the concrete familiarity to this sprawling fairy tale canvas left them bewildered, gaping at the alien world. \\"I don't... know.\\" Kazuto's own words felt foreign as he took in their surroundings. \\"What's your name?\\" \\"Akari,\\" she mumbled, clinging to the solidity of identity amidst the surreal. He gave an empathetic half-smile, extending a hand to steady her as she stood. \\"I'm Kazuto. Kazuto Yamazaki.\\" As the warmth of connection tentatively bridged the unnamed void between them, the surreal reality of magic, untold drama, and the whispers of nascent romance began to unfold. Together, they stood on the precipice of the unknowable, their fates transiently fused by the arcane forces that transported them to this other world—a world where wonder and danger whispered with equal seduction, and where their ordinary lives were about to become the canvas for an extraordinary tale."},{"instruction":"Определитель матрицы не равен нулю, если матрица Выберите один ответ: содержит нулевой столбец; имеет пропорциональные строки является единичной содержит нулевую строку","output":"Определитель матрицы не равен нулю, если матрица - **является единичной**.

Вот несколько причин, почему это происходит: 1. Линейная зависимость столбцов: Если ранг матрицы меньше числа её столбцов, это означает, что некоторые столбцы можно выразить через линейные комбинации других столбцов. Поэтому отдельные переменные не могут быть однозначно определены, и появляются свободные переменные, значения которых можно выбирать произвольно. 2. Свободные переменные: Количество свободных переменных равно n - rank(A). Эти переменные могут принимать бесконечное количество значений, создавая бесконечное множество решений системы уравнений. 3. Геометрическая интерпретация: В случае линейной системы с двумя переменными, если они линейно зависимы, соответствующие уравнения описывают одну и ту же линию, и следовательно, есть бесконечно много точек пересечения (решений). В случае трех переменных, система уравнений может описывать плоскость в трехмерном пространстве, и также существует бесконечное множество точек на этой плоскости, которые удовлетворяют системе уравнений. 4. Общее решение: Наличие свободных переменных позволяет сформулировать общее решение, включающее эти переменные как параметры. Различные значения этих параметров приводят к различным конкретным решениям системы.

Екатерина Великая поощряла просвещение и культуру, в том числе и развитие книжного дела, которое считалось неотъемлемой частью образования и наук. Вот несколько ключевых моментов обстановки книгопечатания при Екатерине II: 1. **Просветительская деятельность:** Воодушевлённая идеями Просвещения, Екатерина II стремилась распространить знания среди народа. Для этого необходимо было увеличить количество и доступность книг. 2. **Рост типографий:** Увеличилось количество частных типографий, а также государственных печатных организаций. Это позволило расширить общее количество издаваемых книг и сделать их более доступными для различных слоёв населения. 3. **Цензура:** Несмотря на просветительские устремления, в России при Екатерине существовала система цензуры, контролирующая содержание печатной продукции. В 1783 году был создан Высший учрежденный об осмотре печатных дел, который регулировал издательскую деятельность. 4. **Поддержка литературы:** Екатерина Великая сама была писательницей и драматургом, а также обладала обширной библиотекой. Она активно поддерживала русских писателей и учёных, что способствовало их творчеству и распространению их работ. 5. **Образование:** Екатерина II существенно влияла на развитие образовательной системы, что, в свою очередь, повышало спрос на учебники и научные издания. Во время её правления были основаны новые образовательные учреждения, в том числе и для женщин. 6. **Переводы иностранной литературы:** Екатерина II стимулировала переводы зарубежных научных трудов, философских и литературных произведений на русский язык, с тем чтобы сделать их доступными для российского читателя.

Основные моменты образовательных реформ Екатерины Великой можно описать следующим образом: 1. **Демократизация образования:** Екатерина стремилась сделать образование широко доступным для всех слоёв населения, что отражалось в создании новых образовательных учреждений, включая начальные и средние школы, которые были открыты и для детей крестьян и городского низшего класса. 2. **Учреждения для женщин:** Особое внимание было уделено женскому образованию, что было новаторским шагом для того времени. Были открыты институты благородных девиц, предназначенные для образования девушек из аристократии и буржуазии. 3. **\\"Устав о народном училище\\" (1786 год):** Этот устав стал важнейшим документом, заложившим основы системы народного образования в России. Он предусматривал создание основной сети школ в империи, включая парафиальные (приходские) школы, уездные и губернские училища. Устав ставил перед образованием цель не просто обеспечить грамотность, но и дать основы профессиональных знаний и навыков. 4. **Программное содержание:** Образовательная программа включала в себя не только чтение и письмо, но и ряд практических предметов, таких как геометрия, география, история, закон Божий, рисование и каллиграфия. Такое расширение учебных программ способствовало формированию всеобъемлющего подхода к образованию. 5. **Поддержка наук и искусств:** Помимо реформ в области образования, Екатерина поддерживала развитие наук, искусств и литературы, считая культурное процветание важным элементом просвещённого общества.

Несколько важных аспектов языковой обстановки в России XVIII века: 1. **Реформы Петра Великого:** Реформы Петра I включали изменения в русском языке, например, введение нового гражданского шрифта в 1708 году для приближения русского алфавита к латинскому. Это было частью его более широких усилий по модернизации России. 2. **Влияние иностранных языков:** В XVIII веке русский дворянский класс активно изучал иностранные языки, особенно французский. Это привело к тому, что множество французских слов вошло в русский язык, особенно в области моды, искусства и государственного администрирования. 3. **Литературное развитие:** В это время русская литература стала формироваться как отдельное направление, с переходом от религиозных текстов к светской литературе, включая поэзию, прозу и драматургию. Язык литературы становился более изысканным и развитым. 4. **Языковая нормализация:** Происходила стандартизация русского литературного языка. Грамматики и словари, такие как труды Михаила Ломоносова, способствовали унификации и нормализации языка. 5. **Урбанизация и образование:** Процесс урбанизации и развитие системы образования способствовали распространению стандартного русского языка за пределами аристократии. 6. **Региональные языки и диалекты:** В то же время, разнообразие народов и культур Российской империи означало, что внутри страны использовалось множество региональных языков и диалектов. Вопрос о языковом многообразии и его роли в обществе по-прежнему оставался актуальным. Подводя итог, XVIII век оказал ключевое влияние на развитие русского языка. Процессы модернизации и культурных изменений привели к появлению современного русского литературного языка, который продолжал развиваться в последующие столетия."},{"instruction":"появлению современного русского литературного языка","output":"Формирование современного русского литературного языка - процесс, который занял несколько веков и кульминировал в XVIII-XIX веках, при этом основы были заложены уже во времена Петра Великого и продолжили развиваться с течением времени. **Ранний этап (XVII - начало XVIII века)** Русский язык до реформ Петра I был в значительной степени церковнославянским, с сильным влиянием древнерусского языка. Лексика, синтаксис и стилистика текстов этого времени были ближе к церковнославянскому стандарту, который отличался от разговорного народного языка. **Реформы Петра I (начало XVIII века)** Петр Великий предпринял попытки стандартизировать и упростить русский алфавит и правописание с помощью введения гражданского шрифта, что облегчило печатание и чтение текстов на русском языке. Его реформы ориентировали русский язык на более простое и понятное написание. **\\"Эпоха Просвещения\\" (вторая половина XVIII века)** Во второй половине XVIII века огромный вклад в становление русского литературного языка внес Михаил Васильевич Ломоносов. Он предложил тристилевую систему произведений (высокий, средний и низкий стили), положил начало теории литературного русского языка и разработал первую русскую грамматику. Ломоносов также внес значительный вклад в развитие научной терминологии на русском языке. **Конец XVIII - начало XIX века** К концу XVIII века, и особенно в XIX веке, русский литературный язык приобрел основные черты, которые мы можем узнать сегодня. В это время появились произведения, ставшие классикой русской литературы, в том числе труды Александра Пушкина, которого часто называют основателем современного русского литературного языка. **Середина XIX века и далее** Разнообразие стилей и углубление содержания было продолжено последующими поколениями писателей, таких как Лев Толстой, Фёдор Достоевский, Иван Тургенев и другими. Разработка и уточнение грамматических норм продолжались, чему также способствовала активная издательская деятельность и образовательная реформа. Со временем русский литературный язык становился более унифицированным и стандартизированным, обретая форму, в которой он существует в современном виде."},{"instruction":"До XVIII века русский язык развивался естественным образом без официального вмешательства. Письменный язык и общесвенно-повседневный язык представляли собой две независимые системы. Первый использовал церковнославянский язык, второй - русский. С началом XVIII века языковая обстановка стала многоязычной. С одной стороны, церковнославянский язык продолжал занимать важное положение в религиозных, государственных и культурных сферах. В то же время русский язык начал входить в письменную форму и его доля постепенно увеличивалась. С другой стороны, различные европейские языки проникали в Россию, принося с собой множество новых терминов и трудных слов, в основном в области технической терминологии. Это существенно обогатило словарь русского языка, но также усложнило языковую ситуацию. С середины XVIII века Романов, Карамзин и другие проводили теоретические и практические исследования, и русский язык \\"постепенно избавился от латинской структуры и ограничений древнеславянского лексикона, приблизившись к нормам живой и естественной разговорной речи\\".","output":"Ваши наблюдения относительно развития русского языка до и во время XVIII века достаточно точны. Давайте рассмотрим подробнее эти этапы развития. **До XVIII века: Разделение письменного и разговорного языка** До XVIII века в России существовало резкое разделение между письменным и разговорным языком. Письменные тексты создавались главным образом на церковнославянском языке, который отличался от русского разговорного языка сложностью и архаичностью грамматических форм и лексики. При этом церковнославянский использовался не только для религиозных текстов, но и для официальной документации и других важных письменных дел. Разговорный же язык - живой народный русский язык - использовался в повседневном общении и был значительно более динамичен и прост для восприятия. **XVIII век: Языковые реформы и многоязычие** С приходом XVIII века и особенно во время правления Петра I начался процесс стандартизации и унификации русского языка. Реформы были направлены на сближение письменной формы языка с разговорным, что подразумевало упрощение орфографии и грамматики. В это же время происходит активное проникновение европейских языков, преимущественно французского и немецкого, в российскую языковую среду. Европейские языки использовались в дворянской среде, а также его влияние было заметно в науке, технике и культуре. Заемные слова начали активно входить в русский язык, обогащая его лексику. **Роль писателей и лингвистов XVIII века** В XVIII веке такие личности, как Михаил Васильевич Ломоносов, существенно внесли вклад в развитие русского языка, создавая труды, акцентирующие внимание на необходимости развития и стандартизации русского литературного языка и стимулируя его использование в научной и литературной сферах. К началу XIX века, под влиянием трудов таких писателей, как Николай Михайлович Карамзин, русский литературный язык стал более точным, эмоциональным и выразительным. Карамзин, в частности, сделал шаги к упрощению стиля написания, делая его ближе к устной речи, что сделало язык более доступным и понятным широкой аудитории."},{"instruction":"I. Социально-культурные импульсы к развитию лексикографии России XVIII века Французский лексикограф Алан Рей эмфатично утверждает: «Современная цивилизация — это цивилизация словарей»[1 Гак В.Г. От толкового словаря к энциклопедии языка (Из опыта современной французской лексикографии). —Известия АН СССР. 1971. № 6, С. 524-530.]11. Подобное мнение делится и китайский учёный Юн Хэ Мин, который рассматривая историю английской лексикографии, отмечает, что в каждой культурной эпохе свой набор первостепенных гуманитарных потребностей и характерных духовных ценностей, именно они задают вектор развития соответствующей культуры словарей. Эти словари интегрируют в себя ключевые черты цивилизации и духовные устремления эпохи, становясь её ярким отражением[2 雍和明[Юн Хэмин]. 英语词典史[История английской лексикографии ]. 北京 [Пекин]. 2015. (на кит. яз.)]22. Ответ на вопрос о культурной основе и социальном контексте, которые способствовали развитию лексикографии в России XVIII века, требует рассмотрения исторического фона того периода. 1. Российская империя как культурно-лингвистический феномен Длительное время российская культура была обособлена вследствие географических и политических факторов, однако с воцарением Петра I начался период радикальных перемен. Историк Шаповалов по этому поводу отмечает: «Истоки современной российской цивилизации закладываются в реформах Петра I и процессе модернизации XVIII века»[3 Шаповалов В.Ф. Истоки и смысл российской цивилизации. М. 2003. ]33. Эти преобразования открыли России путь к активной интеграции в ряды могущественных европейских наций, что привело к расцвету Российской империи в период просветительского правления Екатерины II, когда государство достигло новых высот в искусстве, науке и культуре. 2. Трансформация системы образования До наступления XVIII века система образования в России была преимущественно застывшей в рамках религиозных доктрин, и ограничивалась начальным обучением в приходских и монастырских училищах[4 李小桃[Ли Сяотао]. 俄国的教育与俄罗斯知识分子的诞生[Русское образование и рождение русской интеллигенции]. —外国语文[зарубежная филология]. 2009. № 5, С. 109-112.]44. Преображение образования было инициировано реформами Петра I, который положил начало светского учебного процесса. Блогодаря чему «были основаны светские профессиональные школы разного уровня, которые не только готовили специалистов различных профилей, но и давали общее образование»[5 РЕФОРМЫ ПЕТРА I В ОБЛАСТИ ОБРАЗОВАНИЯ // Большая российская энциклопедия. Том РОССИЯ. Москва, 2004, стр. 676-677. ]55. Дальнейшее укрепление направления в образовании пришлось на время основания Российской академии наук и ряд образовательных институтов в её структуре, что стало новым ключевым этапом в развитии национальной науки и образования. Особую веху в эволюции образовательной системы составило открытие Московского и Санкт-Петербургского университетов, которые в дальнейшем сыграли значительную роль в деле распространения светских знаний. В период правления Екатерины II были предприняты меры к демократизации образования, заключавшиеся в расширении его доступности для широких слоев населения. были основаны новые образовательные учреждения, в том числе и для женщин. Особую роль сыграл “Устав о народном училище” (1786 г.), который ознаменовал собой стремление к внедрению элементов просвещенного абсолютизма в образовательную практику, обозначив формирование системы народных школ с улучшенной программой для обеспечения более высокого уровня грамотности и профессиональной подготовки. 3. Научное возрождение «В начале нового периода российской истории, вплоть до первых десятилетий восемнадцатого века, наука (или натуральная философия, как ее называли в Западной Европе) не играла почти никакой роли»[6 Грэхэм Л.Р. Очерки истории российской и совесткой науки. М. 1998. ]66. Однако с 1724 года, когда была основана Российская академия наук, ситуация коренным образом изменилась. Это был значительный шаг, который стал катализатором для ускорения развития научных исследований в России. Работа Академии наук оказала мощное влияние на прогресс в таких областях, как математика, механика, физика, астрономия, биология, химия, география и геология. Благодаря усилиям этого учреждения, Россия активно включилась в процесс международной научной жизни и значительно продвинулась в различных направлениях научного знания. В дополнение к развитию точных и естественных наук, гуманитарные дисциплины также достигли значительных высот, особенно в областях истории, экономики, литературной критики и, особенно, лингвистики. Выдающимся вкладом в развитие русского языкознания стала деятельность М.В. Ломоносова. Его знаменитое сочинение “Российская грамматика”(1755г.) положило начало системному анализу русского языка и стало фундаментом для его дальнейшей нормализации и стандартизации. Ломоносов активно выступал против чрезмерного использования тяжеловесных церковнославянских элементов в русской речи и противопоставлял им принципы ясности, точности и выразительности. Введенная им теория трех стилей — высокого, среднего и низкого — предоставила теоретические рамки для исследования огромного потенциала русского языка в чётком соответствии с различными литературными контекстами. Эти принципы существенно обогатили русскую литературную норму и способствовали формированию гибкой стилистики, соответствующей разным уровням общения и различным жанрам литературы. 4.Печать Технология печати была привнесена в Россию из Центральной Европы в середине XVI века[7 Яковлена М. Книгопечатание в России. —Альманах \\"Наследие\\". Москва. 2022 г. [Электронный ресурс]. URL: https://nasledie.digital/articles/knigopechatanie-v-rossii (дата обращения: 28.12.2023). ]77. Однако до XVIII века она не получила широкого распространения. В XVIII веке Петр Великий провёл значительную реформу письменности, в ходе которой была упрощена кириллица, и был введён новый гражданский шрифт для издания учебников и других светских книг. Эти меры способствовали возрастанию интереса к светской литературе, что стимулировало развитие книжной индустрии в России. В период правления императрицы Екатерины II книгопечатание в России испытало значительный подъём. Екатерина Великая поощряла просвещение и культуру, в том числе и развитие книжного дела, которое считалось неотъемлемой частью образования и наук. Увеличилось количество частных типографий, а также государственных печатных организаций. Это позволило расширить общее количество издаваемых книг и сделать их более доступными для различных слоёв населения. Согласно статистическим данным, за XVIII век было опубликовано примерно 95 тысяч различных изданий и около 200 разных журналов[8 Алексеев А.И., Измозик В.С., Куликов Ю.С. и др. Культурология. История культуры России: учебное пособие для студентов вузов. СПб. 2005. ]8. Такой рост публикаций способствовал распространению знаний и образования в России, укрепляя основы светского общества и культуры. 5. До XVIII века русский язык развивался естественным образом без официального вмешательства. Письменный язык и общесвенно-повседневный язык представляли собой две независимые системы. Первый использовал церковнославянский язык, второй - русский. С началом XVIII века языковая обстановка стала многоязычной. С одной стороны, церковнославянский язык продолжал занимать важное положение в религиозных, государственных и культурных сферах. В то же время русский язык начал входить в письменную форму и его доля постепенно увеличивалась. С другой стороны, различные европейские языки проникали в Россию, принося с собой множество новых терминов и трудных слов, в основном в области технической терминологии. Это существенно обогатило лексику русского языка, но также усложнило языковую ситуацию. С середины XVIII века Романов, Карамзин и другие проводили теоретические и практические исследования, и русский язык “постепенно избавился от латинской структуры и ограничений древнеславянского лексикона, приблизившись к нормам живой и естественной разговорной речи”. задумайте более подходящее заголовки","output":"Основываясь на представленном тексте, можно предложить следующие более подходящие заголовки для каждого из пяти пунктов: 1. **«Эволюция лексикографии в контексте социально-культурных перемен России XVIII века»** 2. **«От религиозного обучения к светскому просвещению: реформы Петра Великого и их влияние на образование»** 3. **«Возрождение научного духа в Российской империи и его вклад в развитие лексикографии»** 4. **«Расцвет книгопечатания в XVIII веке и его роль в формировании русской лексикографии»** 5. **«Языковые трансформации XVIII века: путь к разговорному русскому языку в лексикографии»** Эти заголовки лучше отражают конкретные аспекты и точки фокуса, поднимаемые в каждом из раскрытых вопросов.

Это обусловлено тем, что процветание страны обеспечивает не только политическую и экономическую поддержку для создания словарей, но, что более важно, в процессе стремительного развития в различных аспектах взаимодействия с западными странами и внутреннего развития Российской империи, становится явным серьезное отсутствие словарных ресурсов для отражения новых явлений, изменений, идей и концепций. Это именно то, что делает создание словарей в России в этот период столь важным, приводя к значительному увеличению как количества, так и разнообразия словарного фонда по сравнению с предыдущими столетиями. Рост числа школ и увеличение образовательных учреждений привели к необходимости разработки специализированных учебных словарей. Эти словари были предназначены для школьников и студентов, чтобы помогать им в освоении языка и различных научных дисциплин. Их авторами выступали ученые-академики, преподаватели и учителя учебных заведений , такие как М.В. Ломоносов, И.А. Гейм, Ф. Гелтергоф, Н.Г. Курганов и др. В процессе развития естественных и гуманитарных наук в XVIII веке возникла насущная потребность в знаниях, актуальных для этих сфер. Российская академия наук инициировала масштабный проект по переводу научных трудов с европейских языков, что привело к потоку иностранных слов и терминов, вливающихся в лексическую систему русского языка и стимулировавших создание лексикографических инструментов, таких как переводные словари, словари иностранных слов и словари непонятных слов, для облегчения процесса перевода и понимания иноязычных текстов. Тем временем, развитие лингвистики способствовало созданию нормативных толковых словарей русского языка. М.В. Ломоносов и его современные лексикографы реформировали структуру словарных статей, увеличивая их содержательность и точность. Они внедрили новые методы для определения значений слов и их использования в контексте, что отражало развитие русского языка и его адаптацию к новому научному мировоззрению. Наконец, Становление и углубление специализированных знаний в различных научных отраслях потребовало разработки тематичных словарей, что стало новой тенденцией в лексикографии XVIII века. Создавались и публиковались словари, посвящённые отдельным дисциплинам, в частности – химии, ботанике, медицене и другим научным областям. Эти издания стали незаменимыми справочниками, фиксирующими языковые стандарты и способствующими расширению границ научного понимания через язык. Образовательная миссия: Словари XVIII века служили не только инструментом для учёных, но и средством распространения знаний среди образовательного класса и более широкого слоя общества. Публикация словарей стала важным шагом в образовательном процессе той поры. Такая доступность и разнообразие словарной продукции способствовали лексикографическому буму, отличающемуся стремительным увеличением объема и качества словарных работ. Особое место среди напечатанных книг занимали грамматики и словари, которые сыграли определенную роль в распространении филологических знаний, в упорядочении правописания и в научной разработке русской лексики8. Население получило больше возможностей для изучения языка и обогащения лингвистической культуры. Следовательно, можно утверждать, что такое расширение словарного спектра оказывало непосредственное воздействие на интеллектуальное развитие общества, эффективно повышало уровень грамотности и способствовало культурному прогрессу. XVIII век стал вехой в развитии словарного дела, положив начало эпохе систематизации русского лексикона и установлению литературных норм, служащих основой для русского литературного языка до наших дней. Таким образом, отражение социокультурных динамик в лексикографии XVIII века выступает в качестве показателя комплексных общественных изменений и культурных трансформаций, которые потребовали от словарной практики гибкости и адаптации к изменяющимся условиям. При анализе развития лексикографии в России данного периода существенно учитывать её роль не только как зеркала научного прогресса, но и как ключевого элемента, отражающего культурный авангард, стремящийся к расширению границ познания и обогащению духовной сферы общества. Вклад социокультурных элементов в формирование русской лексикографии XVIII века был значительным. Этот временной период ознаменовался интеграцией языкового материала с культурными достижениями, что проложило путь для дальнейшего развития словарного состава и изучения русского языка. Лексикографические издания той эпохи видоизменились, превратившись не только в хранилище словарного запаса, но и в индикаторы интеллектуального взлёта и культурного преображения российского общества. Они зафиксировали эволюцию языка, обусловленную научными открытиями и культурным просвещением, отражая богатство и многообразие духовной жизни того времени. улучшите по языку и содержанию","output":"В Китае существует изречение \\"盛世修典\\" (shèng shì xiū diǎn), что переводится как \\"во времена расцвета – время создавать словари\\".

Просвещение Введение В эпоху, когда книгопечатание начало свое торжественное шествие по миру, возрастает и значение лексикографии — искусства создания словарей, свидетельствующих о богатстве и особенностях естественного языка. XVIII век для России стал временем культурного расцвета и социальных перемен, когда лексикографическая деятельность отмотала от своих традиционных привязанностей и поспешила навстречу потребностям быстро меняющегося общества. Внутренние и внешние факторы, включая политические реформы, контакты с зарубежными культурами и стремление к энциклопедичности знания, способствовали радикальному обновлению и расширению словарного фонда русского языка. В этот период лексикография выходит на качественно новый уровень, опережая языковые изменения и откликаясь на вызовы времени. Цель данной работы — осветить роль словарей как культурного явления в России XVIII века, которые стали ответом на вызовы социальной динамики и культурной адаптации. Настоящее исследование направлено на изучение глубинных процессов, стимулирующих создание и развитие словарей, а также функций и структур словарных работ, оформившихся в единую лексикографическую традицию. Мы должны осмыслить значение и роль человеческого фактора в этих процессах, анализируя вклад авторов словарей и их взаимодействие с читателями. Тем самым, мы стремимся представить объективную картину развития словарной культуры России в XVIII веке, подчеркнуть ее вклад в мировую лексикографическую науку и оценить значимость для сохранения языкового разнообразия и культурного наследия. I. Социально-культурные импульсы к развитию лексикографии России XVIII века Французский лексикограф Алан Рей эмфатично утверждает: «Современная цивилизация — это цивилизация словарей»[1 Гак В.Г. От толкового словаря к энциклопедии языка (Из опыта современной французской лексикографии). —Известия АН СССР. 1971. № 6, С. 524-530.]11. Подобное мнение делится и китайский учёный Юн Хэ Мин, который рассматривая историю английской лексикографии, отмечает, что в каждой культурной эпохе свой набор первостепенных гуманитарных потребностей и характерных духовных ценностей, именно они задают вектор развития соответствующей культуры словарей. Эти словари интегрируют в себя ключевые черты цивилизации и духовные устремления эпохи, становясь её ярким отражением[2 雍和明[Юн Хэмин]. 英语词典史[История английской лексикографии ]. 北京 [Пекин]. 2015. (на кит. яз.)]22. Ответ на вопрос о культурной основе и социальном контексте, которые способствовали развитию лексикографии в России XVIII века, требует рассмотрения исторического фона того периода. 1. Российская империя как культурно-лингвистический феномен Длительное время российская культура была обособлена вследствие географических и политических факторов, однако с воцарением Петра I начался период радикальных перемен. Историк Шаповалов по этому поводу отмечает: «Истоки современной российской цивилизации закладываются в реформах Петра I и процессе модернизации XVIII века»[3 Шаповалов В.Ф. Истоки и смысл российской цивилизации. М. 2003. ]33. Эти преобразования открыли России путь к активной интеграции в ряды могущественных европейских наций, что привело к расцвету Российской империи в период просветительского правления Екатерины II, когда государство достигло новых высот в искусстве, науке и культуре. 2. Трансформация системы образования До наступления XVIII века система образования в России была преимущественно застывшей в рамках религиозных доктрин, и ограничивалась начальным обучением в приходских и монастырских училищах[4 李小桃[Ли Сяотао]. 俄国的教育与俄罗斯知识分子的诞生[Русское образование и рождение русской интеллигенции]. —外国语文[зарубежная филология]. 2009. № 5, С. 109-112. (на кит. яз.) ]44. Преображение образования было инициировано реформами Петра I, который положил начало светского учебного процесса. Блогодаря чему «были основаны светские профессиональные школы разного уровня, которые не только готовили специалистов различных профилей, но и давали общее образование»[5 РЕФОРМЫ ПЕТРА I В ОБЛАСТИ ОБРАЗОВАНИЯ // Большая российская энциклопедия. Том РОССИЯ. Москва, 2004, стр. 676-677. ]55. Дальнейшее укрепление направления в образовании пришлось на время основания Российской академии наук и ряд образовательных институтов в её структуре, что стало новым ключевым этапом в развитии национальной науки и образования. Особую веху в эволюции образовательной системы составило открытие Московского и Санкт-Петербургского университетов, которые в дальнейшем сыграли значительную роль в деле распространения светских знаний. В период правления Екатерины II были предприняты меры к демократизации образования, заключавшиеся в расширении его доступности для широких слоев населения. были основаны новые образовательные учреждения, в том числе и для женщин.

Возрождение научного духа в Российской империи «В начале нового периода российской истории, вплоть до первых десятилетий восемнадцатого века, наука (или натуральная философия, как ее называли в Западной Европе) не играла почти никакой роли»[6 Грэхэм Л.Р. Очерки истории российской и совесткой науки. М. 1998. ]66. Однако с 1724 года, когда была основана Российская академия наук, ситуация коренным образом изменилась. Это был значительный шаг, который стал катализатором для ускорения развития научных исследований в России. Работа Академии наук оказала мощное влияние на прогресс в таких областях, как математика, механика, физика, астрономия, биология, химия, география и геология. Благодаря усилиям этого учреждения, Россия активно включилась в процесс международной научной жизни и значительно продвинулась в различных направлениях научного знания. В дополнение к развитию точных и естественных наук, гуманитарные дисциплины также достигли значительных высот, особенно в областях истории, экономики, литературной критики и, особенно, лингвистики. Выдающимся вкладом в развитие русского языкознания стала деятельность М.В. Ломоносова.

Книгопечатание в России. —Альманах \\"Наследие\\". Москва. 2022 г. [Электронный ресурс]. URL: https://nasledie.digital/articles/knigopechatanie-v-rossii (дата обращения: 28.12.2023). ]77.

Согласно статистическим данным, за XVIII век было опубликовано примерно 95 тысяч различных изданий и около 200 разных журналов[8 Алексеев А.И., Измозик В.С., Куликов Ю.С. и др. Культурология. История культуры России: учебное пособие для студентов вузов. СПб. 2005. ]8. Такой рост публикаций способствовал распространению знаний и образования в России, укрепляя основы светского общества и культуры. 5.Языковые трансформации XVIII века До XVIII века русский язык развивался естественным образом без официального вмешательства. Письменный язык и общесвенно-повседневный язык представляли собой две независимые системы. Первый использовал церковнославянский язык, второй - русский. С началом XVIII века языковая обстановка стала многоязычной. С одной стороны, церковнославянский язык продолжал занимать важное положение в религиозных, государственных и культурных сферах. В то же время русский язык начал входить в письменную форму и его доля постепенно увеличивалась. С другой стороны, различные европейские языки проникали в Россию, принося с собой множество новых терминов и трудных слов, в основном в области технической терминологии. Это существенно обогатило лексику русского языка, но также усложнило языковую ситуацию. С середины XVIII века Романов, Карамзин и другие проводили теоретические и практические исследования, и русский язык “постепенно избавился от латинской структуры и ограничений древнеславянского лексикона, приблизившись к нормам живой и естественной разговорной речи”. Вышеупомянутые социокультурные факторы сыграли значительную роль в стимулировании развития лексикографической культуры России XVIII века. В Китае существует изречение “盛世修典” (shèng shì xiū diǎn), что переводится как “во времена расцвета – время создавать словари”. Это утверждение замечательно отображает чрезвычайную роль словарей в такой знаковой эпохе, как утверждение Российской империи. Благополучие страны не просто обеспечивает политическую и экономическую поддержку для лексикографии, но, что ещё важнее, в условиях динамичного развития и интеграции с западными державами, заметно острое отсутствие словарей, способных отразить новые явления, концепты и идеи. Именно это обстоятельство обусловило крайнюю важность работы над словарями в России в тот период, что привело к беспрецедентному росту количества и многообразия лексикографических изданий. Развитие школьного образования и множество новых учебных заведений создали потребность в специализированных образовательных словарях, предназначенных для учащихся и студентов всех уровней. Эти словари, авторство которых принадлежит учёным-академикам и преподавателям, таким как М.В. Ломоносов, И.А. Гейм, Ф. Гелтергоф и Н.Г. Курганов, стали инструментом для освоения разнообразных учебных дисциплин. Прогресс в естественных и гуманитарных науках века XVIII породил срочную потребность в актуализированных знаниях в данных сферах. Российская академия наук инициировала обширную программу перевода западноевропейских научных работ, что привело к притоку иностранных слов и концептов в русский лексикон и стало импульсом для создания различных лексикографических инструментов – от переводных словарей до словарей иностранных и непонятных слов, облегчающих перевод и понимание импортированного текстового материала. Специализированные знания, формирующиеся в различных областях науки, потребовали создания тематических словарей, что стало новым направлением в лексикографии XVIII века. В эру Екатерины II словари, посвящённые конкретным областям знания – химии, ботанике, медицине – стали неотъемлемыми справочниками для учёных и студентов, фиксирующими языковые стандарты и способствующими пониманию науки через язык. Важной образовательной миссией словарей XVIII века стало не просто пролегание пути для научной мысли, но и распространение знаний среди учёных и в более широких слоях общества. Они стали ключевым звеном в образовательном процессе, упорядочивая правила правописания, развивая филологические знания и обогащая русскую лексику. Тем самым, XVIII век ознаменовался началом новой эры в словарном деле – эпохой усиленной систематизации русского лексикона, установления литературных норм и закладки основ современного литературного русского языка, который продолжает развиваться и сегодня. Лексикография XVIII века, отражая комплекс социокультурных изменений, служит показателем значимых общественных и культурных трансформаций. Её развитие освещает не только зеркало научных достижений, но и культурный напор, манящий открыть новые горизонты знания и обогатить духовные аспекты общества. Таким образом, синтезирование языковых ресурсов с культурными требованиями времени проложило путь для последующих достижений в области изучения и использования русского языка, который продолжает созидать свою неповторимую историю языкового и культурного богатства. II. Развитие и трансформации в словарной практике России XVIII века Словари, как интегральный элемент культуры, непременно претерпевают трансформации, отвечая на вызовы социокультурных изменений. В XVIII веке на фоне глобальных общественных метаморфоз и в соответствии с специфическими социокультурными параметрами эпохи, словарная традиция испытала существенные преобразования. Это нашло отражение в появлении новых функциональных особенностей и типов словарей, что сделало XVIII век знаковым этапом в истории русской лексикографии и подготовило почву для последующих достижений в этом направлении. 1. Концептуализация и утверждение названия “словарь” Зафиксированное применение термина “словарь” для наименования справочных изданий в русском лексикографии стало результатом эволюции насквозь XVIII век. Ранние глоссарии, представлявшие собой первоначальный этап в истории словарей, использовались для разъяснения сложных конструкций в религиозных текстах и были прародителями более поздних, более комплексных лексикографических произведений. Эра возрождения славянских словарей, объединяющая методы средневекового грамматического анализа и словарного творчества, ознаменовала начало нового направления в богатой полифонии терминологических обозначений, таких как “азбуковник”, “алфавит” и “букварь”, которые впоследствии были сгруппированы под общее понятие “азбуковник”, как отмечается в “Большом энциклопедическом словаре языкознания”[9 АЗБУКОВНИК // Языкознание: Большой энциклопедический словарь. Москва. 1998. ]9. В начале XVII века термин “лексикон” был введен Памво Берындой и оставался доминирующим на протяжении длительного времени. Словари того периода обычно именовали “лексиконами”. Однако с приходом осенних декад XVIII века “словарь” начал вытеснять “лексикон” как предпочтительное обозначение, что подтверждается такими изданиями, как “Словарь разноязычной” (автор Курганов, 1769) и “Церковный словарь” (автор Алексеев, 1773). Завершающим аккордом в утверждении “словаря” в качестве официального термина стало издание масштабного “Словаря Академии Российской” (1789-1794), который заложил фундамент для современной эры “словарей” и смены устоявшихся “лексиконов”. Этот исторический обзор демонстрирует обширный путь развития русской лексикографии, в который вписываются углубленное понимание и становление словарной культуры. Стремительное увеличение объема словарных работ в XVIII веке и развитие словарного жанра привели к общему согласию об использовании термина “словарь”, подчеркивая роль словаря как ключевого инструмента культурного наследия. Таким образом, принятие и закрепление термина “словарь” в конце века стали вехой в истории русской лексикографии и открыли новую страницу в её развитии. 2. Функциональное разнообразие в словарном инструментарии С началом XVIII века произошли значительные нововведения в функциональном аспекте словарей. Развитие многочисленных функций словаря отображает трансформации, которые происходят в связи с социальными инновациями. Как верно было замечено Мо-цзы, важна не номенклатура, а практическая функция — изменение социального ландшафта влечёт за собой изменение в языковых конструкциях. Русские словари XVIII века значительно продвинулись по сравнению со своими предшественниками в плане функций, типологии и структуры. 1) Расширение роли словарей В эпоху зарождения лексикографии основная задача словарей заключалась в переводе и освещении латинских, греческих и старославянских слов, а также в пояснении непонятных терминов. С XVI по XVII век такие издания объединяли в себе объяснение слов, грамматику, орфографию, мифологию и знания об природе, представляя собой смешанный жанр лингвистического и энциклопедического словарной составляющей. С разгаром реформ Петра Великого и началом XVIII века функциональная модель словарей подверглась серьезному разнообразию. Словари начали удовлетворять потребности в изучении иностранных языков, стимулируя образование и межкультурный обмен. От классических языков фокус переключился на современные европейские языки, в первую очередь французский и немецкий. Словари также предоставляли ключи к пониманию заемных слов и сложных терминов, возникающих в результате активного перевода зарубежной литературы. С середины XVIII века словари начали отражать отношение к заимствованиям, под влиянием кампании за языковую чистоту. Дополнительно, возникла нужда в объяснении широкого диапазона специальной терминологии и научно-технических терминов, что стало важным для развития основных сфер в России. Наконец, словари стали выполнять функцию стандартизации русского литературного языка, предлагая информацию о речевых нормах, семантике, синтаксисе и фонетике слов для помощи в освоении нормативных способов выражения. Как итог, в XVIII веке русские словари завершили переход от простых объяснительных миссий к многофункциональному словарному инструменту. 2)дифференциаци типов словарей Функциональное многообразие словарей возрастает, а задачи, предъявляемые к каждому отдельному изданию, становятся всё более специфичными, что влечет за собой дифференциацию словарных типов. На основе обзора Вомперского [1986] Биржакова предложила условное разделение словарей XVIII века в России на четыре основных категории: переводческие, словари иностранных и непонятных слов, специальные словари и толковые словари (Биржакова, 2010, с.16-17). Переводные словари, имеющие наибольшую историю, к этому времени уже достигли значительного уровня развития. В XVIII веке, благодаря углублению международных связей в таких сферах, как дипломатия, международная торговля и научно-технические обмены, а также цветения переводческой деятельности, работы по составлению и изданию переводных словарей приобрели новый импульс. Среди всех категорий словарей переводные занимают доминирующее положение. Почти все многоязычные словари включали в себя латинский язык, который играл ключевую роль в академической коммуникации и образовании того времени. Тем не менее, двуязычные словари, переводящие слова с русского на иностранные языки, были менее распространены и начали своё развитие только после середины века. В области одноязычных словарей намечаются два тенденции: продолжение традиции предыдущих столетий в объяснении иностранных слов, церковнославянских слов и специализированной терминологии и создание национальных нормативных толковых словарей, которые являются новшеством для русской лексикографии. Словари иностранных слов и сложной лексики, а также специализированные словари не являются новинкой, однако они получили новый толчок к развитию за счёт наплыва большого количества иностранных слов и перевода иноязычной литературы в XVIII веке. Большая часть таких словарей прилагалась к переведённым изданиям в качестве пояснений к сложным терминам. В качестве примера можно привести “Толкование сложных слов этой книги”, помещённое в конце русского издания “Введения в историю Европы” Пуфендорфа. Используя заимствования из иностранных источников, Россия стремилась быстро заполнить пробелы в специализированных сферах, в том числе в таких областях, как военное инженерное дело и культурное наследие. Ближе к концу 60-х годов даже многие тома всемирно известной “Энциклопедии” Дидро были переведены на русский язык. В завершение XVIII века появление толковых словарей русского языка стало ответом на растущее национальное самосознание и укрепление статуса национального языка. Знаковым стало издание “Словаря Российской академии” (1789–1794 гг.), охватывающего более 40 тыс. слов. Это издание было высоко оценено выдающимся языковедом В. В. Виноградовым как одно из выдающихся достижений в истории русских словарей (Виноградов, 1977, с.217). 3) Эволюция структуры словарных изданий XVIII век ознаменовал собой период интенсивного развития структуры русских словарей. Изменения в макро- и микроструктуре отразили научные новаторства того времени и отвечали на запросы растущего круга читателей. Как подчёркивают Чжан И-хуа и его коллеги (2007, с.52), аккуратное организованное размещение слов в словарях имеет ключевое значение для эффективности поиска и использования информации. Макроструктура словарей XVIII века сочетала в себе два основных принципа упорядочивания - алфавитный и тематический. Алфавитная организация преобладала в переводных и толковых словарях, в то время как тематическое разделение чаще используется в учебных и многоязычных изданиях. Однако нововведение в алфавитной структуре словарей заключалось в сгруппировке слов по семействам, что демонстрировало этимологические связи и давало более глубокое понимание лексики. Например, в первых томах “Словаря Академии Российской” такой подход нашёл своё применение, но для упрощения процесса поиска в последующих изданиях был введён строгий алфавитный порядок. Микроструктура словарных статей также претерпела значительное развитие. Классическое перечисление эквивалентов и толкований было расширено за счёт информации о произношении, орфографии, грамматических формах и стилистическом освещении слов. Такие издания, как “Российский целлариус” Гёльтергофа и “Польско-русский словарь” Кондратовича, иллюстрируют этот процесс, обогатив стандартные статьи подробными описаниями и примерами использования из литературных источников. “Словарь Академии Российской” стал апогеем этого процесса, предложив читателям комплексную и многофункциональную микроструктуру, сопоставимую с современными энциклопедическими изданиями. Важным аспектом словарей XVIII века стало добавление дополнительных разделов. Предисловия и инструкции, посылающие назначение и принципы пользования словарём, превратились в стандартный элемент подобных изданий и отражали продвинутую теорию лексикографии, как отмечает Чжэн Шубу (2005). А приложение в начале издания списка используемых в словаре сокращений и условных знаков свидетельствовало о стремлении к стандартизации и унификации лексикографических работ. Оценивая вклад XVIII века в русскую лексикографию, исследователи вроде Чжан Чуньсиня (2021) выделяют “Словарь Академии Российской” как мерило развития словарной структуры, подчёркивая его близость к современным лексикографическим методам. Таким образом, через свои структурные инновации и углубленный подход, русская лексикография XVIII века заложила фундамент, на котором построено современное словарное дело, закрепляя его как неотъемлемый инструмент для понимания и изучения языка. III. От авторского замысла к читательскому восприятию: субъекты словарного творчества Человек, как неотъемлемый субъект культуры, играет центральную роль в её развитии. В контексте российской лексикографической культуры XVIII века особое значение имели как создатели, так и пользователи словарей, оказавшие значимое влияние на её эволюцию. С точки зрения создателей словарей, до XVIII века большинство словарных трудов было под силу лишь высококультурным личностям — священнослужителям и представителям гуманитарного научного сообщества, в числе которых стоит отметить таких деятелей, как архимандрит Лаврентий Зизаний, полиглот Максим Грек и поэт-переводчик Памфил Берында. Их деятельность была продиктована социальным положением, уровнем образования и, конечно, запросами времени и культурными потребностями общества. Наступление восемнадцатого века подвело культуру словарей к необходимости удовлетворения разнообразящихся светских запросов в эпоху социальных и культурных перемен. Это вызвало увеличение числа словарей и диверсификацию их тематической направленности. В результате расширился спектр авторов словарей, включавших следующие категории: 1. Священнослужители продолжали играть важную роль в создании традиционных словарей духовного содержания. 2. Из числа профессиональных переводчиков вышли составители двуязычных и многоязычных словарей, включая переводчиков зарубежных лексикографических работ. 3. Преподаватели образовательных институтов стали весомой силой в компиляции учебников и учебных словарей. 4. Ученые и специалисты своего дела приняли на себя разработку словарей по избранной специализации. 5. Политики и общественные деятели также отметились в числе составителей словарей, прилагая к этому свои знания и опыт. Сфера использования словарей также претерпела метаморфозы. В предшествующие века словари были доступны в основном для образованной аристократии и церковной элиты. Однако XVIII век принёс с собой рост численности пользователей словарей: 1. Государственные органы, которым была необходима адаптация передовых западноевропейских практик и знаний. 2. Государственные служащие, задействованные во внешней торговле и дипломатии, а также лица, регулярно контактирующие с иностранными языками в рамках своих профессиональных обязанностей или при учёбе за границей. 3. Специалисты и учёные различных направлений, содействующие научно-техническому прогрессу и являющиеся основными пользователями специализированных словарей. 4. Школьники и студенты, для которых были разработаны образовательные словари и пособия. 5. Широкие слои общественности, обладающие различным уровнем образования и культурных компетенций. Именно благодаря этому взаимодействию между авторами и их аудиторией словари XVIII века смогли перейти от простых переводов или адаптаций зарубежных работ к созданию оригинальных лексикографических произведений, отражающих уникальные лингвистические, культурные и интеллектуальные контуры русского народа. Результатом этих усилий стало то, что словари XVIII века не только обеспечивали сохранение языкового материала, но и служили инструментом для расширения границ познания и культурного обмена, олицетворяя живую связь между историей и современностью. Эти издания стали активными участниками культурной жизни эпохи и одновременно средством образования и саморазвития широкого круга читателей. Заключение Основываясь на проанализированной информации, можно утверждать, что XVIII век стал определяющим временем в развитии русской лексикографии, временем трансформаций и нововведений в искусстве создания словарей. Благодаря обширным политическим реформам, научным открытиям, а также культурным изменениям, которые происходили в обществе, словарная культура достигла своего апогея. За этот период закладывались идеалы Просвещения, что, несомненно, способствовало стремлению к познанию мира и языка. Ключевым фактором успеха стала работа лексикографов — их преданность делу создания словарей, отражающих изменения действительности, а также их способность фиксировать появление новых слов и значений. Словари XVIII века нужно воспринимать не только как сборники слов, но и как отражение социальных идей, культурных потребностей и духовных поисков эпохи. Таким образом, словари выступают не просто как языковые инструменты, но и как хроники времени, несущие неоценимую историческую и культурную ценность. Культурные и социальные изменения, определившие становление словарной деятельности в России XVIII века, сформировали основу, на которой российская лексикография развивалась в последующие столетия. Вклад лексикографов XVIII века в развитие языковой науки неоценим, а их труды продолжают вдохновлять ученых и исследователей на новые открытия и изыскания в области изучения слова. 1.Гак В.Г.

В исследовании основное внимание уделяется реформам, научному просвещению, прогрессу в области печати и образования, а также формированию культурных и языковых стандартов. Изучаются тенденции в изменении функций, типов и структур словарей, а также эффект от деятельности ключевых личностей в словарной традиции. Цель статьи – выявить значимость словарей XVIII века для русской языковой науки и их роль в сохранении культурного наследия. Ключевые слова: лексикография XVIII века, эволюция словарей, русский язык, иностранные заимствования. Введение: В XVIII веке Россия переживает период культурного расцвета и значительных социальных трансформаций, что находит отражение и в лексикографии. В эти годы словарная деятельность освобождается от своих традиционных рамок и стремится удовлетворить потребности быстро меняющегося общества. Лексикография эпохи отвечает на широкий спектр социальных запросов – от политических реформ и культурных обменов с Европой до новых направлений в научных исследованиях, всё это стимулирует обновление и расширение лексического состава русского языка. Целью данной статьи является обоснование места словарей как незаменимого культурного феномена в XVIII-вековой России, а также раскрытие их роли как инструмента социальной динамики и культурной адаптации. Настоящее исследование стремится охватить различные аспекты развития словарей – от динамических процессов, побуждающих к их созданию, до конкретной функциональности и структурных характеристик, а также взаимодействия авторов с аудиторией. Мы пытаемся предоставить всесторонний взгляд на совершенствование словарной культуры в России XVIII века и оценить её вклад в лексикографическую науку и сохранение культурного разнообразия. I. Социально-культурные импульсы к развитию лексикографии в России XVIII века Алан Рей, выдающийся французский лексикограф, утверждает, что современная цивилизация является \\"цивилизацией словарей\\". Похожую мысль высказывает китайский исследователь Юн Хэмин, указывая на то, что каждая культурная эпоха характеризуется собственным набором базовых гуманитарных потребностей и духовных ценностей, которые определяют направление развития культуры словарей. Такие словари становятся отражением ключевых особенностей цивилизации и отражают духовные стремления своего времени. Анализируемый период в истории России олицетворяет собой культурно-лингвистический феномен – стремление к радикальным переменам и модернизации, начатое Петром I и продолжавшееся в правление Екатерины II. Эти перемены приводят к расцвету Российской империи, значительно влияют на искусство, науку и культуру, ускоряя развитие лексикографии. Особое внимание в статье уделяется исследованию трансформации образовательной системы, начиная с реформ Петра Великого, которые инициируют создание светских образовательных учреждений. Указывается на значение \\"Устава о народном училище\\" 1786 года, способствовавшего демократизации образования и формированию системы народных школ. Обсуждается и научное возрождение, олицетворяемое основанием Российской академии наук и разработкой \\"Российской грамматики\\" Ломоносова. Рассмотрение деятельности Академии и Ломоносова демонстрирует усиление научной мысли и стремления к нормализации и стандартизации языка. 4. Расцвет книгопечатания в XVIII веке Анализируется влияние реформ письменности Петра Великого и увеличение книгопечатания во времена Екатерины II на развитие словарных изданий. Отмечается, что реформы способствовали распространению светской литературы и стимулировали рост книжной индустрии, что, в свою очередь, поддержало интерес к словарям и языковым стандартам. 5. Языковые трансформации XVIII века Освещаются языковые изменения XVIII века и их влияние на словарное дело, включая столкновение с многоязычностью и необходимость объяснения новых терминов. Рассматривается углубление исследований и усилий Романова, Карамзина и других в приближении русского языка к нормам живого разговорного диалекта. Заключение синтезирует исследование, подчеркивая влияние XVIII века как переломного момента для развития русской лексикографии и её значение для культурного наследия. Статья заканчивается выводами о том, как социокультурные изменения определили становление словарной деятельности и её вклад в развитие языковой науки."},{"instruction":"I. Социально-культурные импульсы к развитию лексикографии России XVIII века Французский лексикограф Алан Рей эмфатично утверждает: «Современная цивилизация — это цивилизация словарей»[1 Гак В.Г. От толкового словаря к энциклопедии языка (Из опыта современной французской лексикографии). —Известия АН СССР. 1971. № 6, С. 524-530.]11. Подобное мнение делится и китайский учёный Юн Хэ Мин, который рассматривая историю английской лексикографии, отмечает, что в каждой культурной эпохе свой набор первостепенных гуманитарных потребностей и характерных духовных ценностей, именно они задают вектор развития соответствующей культуры словарей. Эти словари интегрируют в себя ключевые черты цивилизации и духовные устремления эпохи, становясь её ярким отражением[2 雍和明[Юн Хэмин]. 英语词典史[История английской лексикографии ]. 北京 [Пекин]. 2015. (на кит. яз.)]22. Ответ на вопрос о культурной основе и социальном контексте, которые способствовали развитию лексикографии в России XVIII века, требует рассмотрения исторического фона того периода. 1. Российская империя как культурно-лингвистический феномен Длительное время российская культура была обособлена вследствие географических и политических факторов, однако с воцарением Петра I начался период радикальных перемен. Историк Шаповалов по этому поводу отмечает: «Истоки современной российской цивилизации закладываются в реформах Петра I и процессе модернизации XVIII века»[3 Шаповалов В.Ф. Истоки и смысл российской цивилизации. М. 2003. ]33. Эти преобразования открыли России путь к активной интеграции в ряды могущественных европейских наций, что привело к расцвету Российской империи в период просветительского правления Екатерины II, когда государство достигло новых высот в искусстве, науке и культуре. 2. Трансформация системы образования До наступления XVIII века система образования в России была преимущественно застывшей в рамках религиозных доктрин, и ограничивалась начальным обучением в приходских и монастырских училищах[4 李小桃[Ли Сяотао]. 俄国的教育与俄罗斯知识分子的诞生[Русское образование и рождение русской интеллигенции]. —外国语文[зарубежная филология]. 2009. № 5, С. 109-112. (на кит. яз.) ]44. Преображение образования было инициировано реформами Петра I, который положил начало светского учебного процесса. Блогодаря чему «были основаны светские профессиональные школы разного уровня, которые не только готовили специалистов различных профилей, но и давали общее образование»[5 РЕФОРМЫ ПЕТРА I В ОБЛАСТИ ОБРАЗОВАНИЯ // Большая российская энциклопедия. Том РОССИЯ. Москва, 2004, стр. 676-677. ]55. Дальнейшее укрепление направления в образовании пришлось на время основания Российской академии наук и ряд образовательных институтов в её структуре, что стало новым ключевым этапом в развитии национальной науки и образования. Особую веху в эволюции образовательной системы составило открытие Московского и Санкт-Петербургского университетов, которые в дальнейшем сыграли значительную роль в деле распространения светских знаний. В период правления Екатерины II были предприняты меры к демократизации образования, заключавшиеся в расширении его доступности для широких слоев населения. были основаны новые образовательные учреждения, в том числе и для женщин. Особую роль сыграл “Устав о народном училище” (1786 г.), который ознаменовал собой стремление к внедрению элементов просвещенного абсолютизма в образовательную практику, обозначив формирование системы народных школ с улучшенной программой для обеспечения более высокого уровня грамотности и профессиональной подготовки. 3. Возрождение научного духа в Российской империи «В начале нового периода российской истории, вплоть до первых десятилетий восемнадцатого века, наука (или натуральная философия, как ее называли в Западной Европе) не играла почти никакой роли»[6 Грэхэм Л.Р. Очерки истории российской и совесткой науки. М. 1998. ]66. Однако с 1724 года, когда была основана Российская академия наук, ситуация коренным образом изменилась. Это был значительный шаг, который стал катализатором для ускорения развития научных исследований в России. Работа Академии наук оказала мощное влияние на прогресс в таких областях, как математика, механика, физика, астрономия, биология, химия, география и геология. Благодаря усилиям этого учреждения, Россия активно включилась в процесс международной научной жизни и значительно продвинулась в различных направлениях научного знания. В дополнение к развитию точных и естественных наук, гуманитарные дисциплины также достигли значительных высот, особенно в областях истории, экономики, литературной критики и, особенно, лингвистики. Выдающимся вкладом в развитие русского языкознания стала деятельность М.В. Ломоносова. Его знаменитое сочинение “Российская грамматика”(1755г.) положило начало системному анализу русского языка и стало фундаментом для его дальнейшей нормализации и стандартизации. Ломоносов активно выступал против чрезмерного использования тяжеловесных церковнославянских элементов в русской речи и противопоставлял им принципы ясности, точности и выразительности. Введенная им теория трех стилей — высокого, среднего и низкого — предоставила теоретические рамки для исследования огромного потенциала русского языка в чётком соответствии с различными литературными контекстами. Эти принципы существенно обогатили русскую литературную норму и способствовали формированию гибкой стилистики, соответствующей разным уровням общения и различным жанрам литературы. 4.Расцвет книгопечатания в XVIII веке Технология печати была привнесена в Россию из Центральной Европы в середине XVI века[7 Яковлена М. Книгопечатание в России. —Альманах \\"Наследие\\". Москва. 2022 г. [Электронный ресурс]. URL: https://nasledie.digital/articles/knigopechatanie-v-rossii (дата обращения: 28.12.2023). ]77. Однако до XVIII века она не получила широкого распространения. В XVIII веке Петр Великий провёл значительную реформу письменности, в ходе которой была упрощена кириллица, и был введён новый гражданский шрифт для издания учебников и других светских книг. Эти меры способствовали возрастанию интереса к светской литературе, что стимулировало развитие книжной индустрии в России. В период правления императрицы Екатерины II книгопечатание в России испытало значительный подъём. Екатерина Великая поощряла просвещение и культуру, в том числе и развитие книжного дела, которое считалось неотъемлемой частью образования и наук. Увеличилось количество частных типографий, а также государственных печатных организаций. Это позволило расширить общее количество издаваемых книг и сделать их более доступными для различных слоёв населения. Согласно статистическим данным, за XVIII век было опубликовано примерно 95 тысяч различных изданий и около 200 разных журналов[8 Алексеев А.И., Измозик В.С., Куликов Ю.С. и др. Культурология. История культуры России: учебное пособие для студентов вузов. СПб. 2005. ]8. Такой рост публикаций способствовал распространению знаний и образования в России, укрепляя основы светского общества и культуры. 5.Языковые трансформации XVIII века До XVIII века русский язык развивался естественным образом без официального вмешательства. Письменный язык и общесвенно-повседневный язык представляли собой две независимые системы. Первый использовал церковнославянский язык, второй - русский. С началом XVIII века языковая обстановка стала многоязычной. С одной стороны, церковнославянский язык продолжал занимать важное положение в религиозных, государственных и культурных сферах. В то же время русский язык начал входить в письменную форму и его доля постепенно увеличивалась. С другой стороны, различные европейские языки проникали в Россию, принося с собой множество новых терминов и трудных слов, в основном в области технической терминологии. Это существенно обогатило лексику русского языка, но также усложнило языковую ситуацию. С середины XVIII века Романов, Карамзин и другие проводили теоретические и практические исследования, и русский язык “постепенно избавился от латинской структуры и ограничений древнеславянского лексикона, приблизившись к нормам живой и естественной разговорной речи”. Вышеупомянутые социокультурные факторы сыграли значительную роль в стимулировании развития лексикографической культуры России XVIII века. В Китае существует изречение “盛世修典” (shèng shì xiū diǎn), что переводится как “во времена расцвета – время создавать словари”. Это утверждение замечательно отображает чрезвычайную роль словарей в такой знаковой эпохе, как утверждение Российской империи. Благополучие страны не просто обеспечивает политическую и экономическую поддержку для лексикографии, но, что ещё важнее, в условиях динамичного развития и интеграции с западными державами, заметно острое отсутствие словарей, способных отразить новые явления, концепты и идеи. Именно это обстоятельство обусловило крайнюю важность работы над словарями в России в тот период, что привело к беспрецедентному росту количества и многообразия лексикографических изданий. Развитие школьного образования и множество новых учебных заведений создали потребность в специализированных образовательных словарях, предназначенных для учащихся и студентов всех уровней. Эти словари, авторство которых принадлежит учёным-академикам и преподавателям, таким как М.В. Ломоносов, И.А. Гейм, Ф. Гелтергоф и Н.Г. Курганов, стали инструментом для освоения разнообразных учебных дисциплин. Прогресс в естественных и гуманитарных науках века XVIII породил срочную потребность в актуализированных знаниях в данных сферах. Российская академия наук инициировала обширную программу перевода западноевропейских научных работ, что привело к притоку иностранных слов и концептов в русский лексикон и стало импульсом для создания различных лексикографических инструментов – от переводных словарей до словарей иностранных и непонятных слов, облегчающих перевод и понимание импортированного текстового материала. Специализированные знания, формирующиеся в различных областях науки, потребовали создания тематических словарей, что стало новым направлением в лексикографии XVIII века. В эру Екатерины II словари, посвящённые конкретным областям знания – химии, ботанике, медицине – стали неотъемлемыми справочниками для учёных и студентов, фиксирующими языковые стандарты и способствующими пониманию науки через язык. Важной образовательной миссией словарей XVIII века стало не просто пролегание пути для научной мысли, но и распространение знаний среди учёных и в более широких слоях общества. Они стали ключевым звеном в образовательном процессе, упорядочивая правила правописания, развивая филологические знания и обогащая русскую лексику. Тем самым, XVIII век ознаменовался началом новой эры в словарном деле – эпохой усиленной систематизации русского лексикона, установления литературных норм и закладки основ современного литературного русского языка, который продолжает развиваться и сегодня. Лексикография XVIII века, отражая комплекс социокультурных изменений, служит показателем значимых общественных и культурных трансформаций. Её развитие освещает не только зеркало научных достижений, но и культурный напор, манящий открыть новые горизонты знания и обогатить духовные аспекты общества. Таким образом, синтезирование языковых ресурсов с культурными требованиями времени проложило путь для последующих достижений в области изучения и использования русского языка, который продолжает созидать свою неповторимую историю языкового и культурного богатства. задумайте тему на эту статью и заголовки для каждого раздела, напишите аннотацию, ключевые слова и введение.","output":"Тема статьи: \\"Лексикографическое наследие России XVIII века: от социокультурного влияния к развитию словарей\\" Заголовки для разделов: I.

В совокупности с процессом интенсивной политической, образовательной и научной модернизации эти изменения обусловили крупномасштабные разработки в области создания словарей. Исследование демонстрирует, что именно в XVIII веке русская лексикография укрепила свой статус как инструмента познания и средства культурного обмена, воплотив в себе дух эпохи и потребности освещающегося общества. Преобразования в системе образования и расширение кругозора российской интеллигенции внесли существенный вклад в требования к словарным изданиям, толкнув их к эволюции и диверсификации. Словари XVIII века стали реакцией на появление новых научных идей, что способствовало формированию специализированных терминологических словарей и толковых изданий, фиксирующих языковые нормы и обогащающих лексический состав русского языка. Отношение к словарям как к основному компоненту лингвистической культуры и осознание необходимости их создания стало ключевым для понимания и адаптации к нарастающему многообразию жизни и общения. Лексикографы, представители всех слоёв образованности, внесли неоценимый вклад в этот процесс, выявив потребности различных групп пользователей словарей и переводя их в действенные словарные решения. Фундаментальный сдвиг в развитии лексикографической культуры в XVIII веке позволил не только сохранить языковое богатство и разнообразие, но и способствовал развитию осознанного подхода к изучению и преподаванию русского языка. Словари этого периода являются не просто хранителями слов, но и живыми артефактами культуры, предлагающими бесценную информацию о мире, мышлении и самовыражении того времени. Заключая, можно уверенно сказать, что лексикографическое наследие XVIII века оказало прямое влияние на формирование русской языковой науки и продолжает оставаться важным ресурсом для современного языкового исследования и культурного понимания. Работа лексикографов XVIII века является бесценным подспорьем в разгадке того, как язык и общество соотносятся и взаимодействуют, создавая непрерывную цепь культурного развития и интеллектуального обогащения, протянувшуюся через века и всё ещё влияющую на лингвистическое сознание и идентичность."},{"instruction":"Заключая, можно уверенно сказать, что лексикографическое наследие XVIII века оказало прямое влияние на формирование русской языковой науки и продолжает оставаться важным ресурсом для современного языкового исследования и культурного понимания.

Реформы и инновации: двигатели лексикографии в России века XVIII Французский лексикограф Алан Рей эмфатично утверждает: «Современная цивилизация — это цивилизация словарей»[1 Гак В.Г. От толкового словаря к энциклопедии языка (Из опыта современной французской лексикографии). —Известия АН СССР. 1971. № 6, С. 524-530.]1. Подобное мнение делится и китайский учёный Юн Хэ Мин, который рассматривая историю английской лексикографии, отмечает, что в каждой культурной эпохе свой набор первостепенных гуманитарных потребностей и характерных духовных ценностей, именно они задают вектор развития соответствующей культуры словарей. Эти словари интегрируют в себя ключевые черты цивилизации и духовные устремления эпохи, становясь её ярким отражением[2 雍和明[Юн Хэмин]. 英语词典史[История английской лексикографии ]. 北京 [Пекин]. 2015. (на кит. яз.)]2. Ответ на вопрос о культурной основе и социальном контексте, которые способствовали развитию лексикографии в России XVIII века, требует рассмотрения исторического фона того периода. Длительное время российская культура была обособлена вследствие географических и политических факторов, однако с воцарением Петра I начался период радикальных перемен. Историк Шаповалов по этому поводу отмечает: «Истоки современной российской цивилизации закладываются в реформах Петра I и процессе модернизации XVIII века»[3 Шаповалов В.Ф. Истоки и смысл российской цивилизации. М. 2003. ]3. Эти преобразования открыли России путь к активной интеграции в ряды могущественных европейских наций, что привело к расцвету Российской империи в период просветительского правления Екатерины II, когда государство достигло новых высот в искусстве, науке и культуре. 2.Образовательные маяки: от монастырских школ к университетам До наступления XVIII века система образования в России была преимущественно застывшей в рамках религиозных доктрин, и ограничивалась начальным обучением в приходских и монастырских училищах[4 李小桃[Ли Сяотао]. 俄国的教育与俄罗斯知识分子的诞生[Русское образование и рождение русской интеллигенции]. —外国语文[зарубежная филология]. 2009. № 5, С. 109-112. (на кит. яз.) ]4. Преображение образования было инициировано реформами Петра I, который положил начало светского учебного процесса. Блогодаря чему «были основаны светские профессиональные школы разного уровня, которые не только готовили специалистов различных профилей, но и давали общее образование»[5 РЕФОРМЫ ПЕТРА I В ОБЛАСТИ ОБРАЗОВАНИЯ // Большая российская энциклопедия. Том РОССИЯ. Москва, 2004, стр. 676-677. ]5. Дальнейшее укрепление направления в образовании пришлось на время основания Российской академии наук и ряд образовательных институтов в её структуре, что стало новым ключевым этапом в развитии национальной науки и образования. Особую веху в эволюции образовательной системы составило открытие Московского и Санкт-Петербургского университетов, которые в дальнейшем сыграли значительную роль в деле распространения светских знаний. В период правления Екатерины II были предприняты меры к демократизации образования, заключавшиеся в расширении его доступности для широких слоев населения. были основаны новые образовательные учреждения, в том числе и для женщин. Особую роль сыграл “Устав о народном училище” (1786 г.), который ознаменовал собой стремление к внедрению элементов просвещенного абсолютизма в образовательную практику, обозначив формирование системы народных школ с улучшенной программой для обеспечения более высокого уровня грамотности и профессиональной подготовки. 3.Научная ренессанс в России: академия наук и её влияние на словарное дело «В начале нового периода российской истории, вплоть до первых десятилетий восемнадцатого века, наука (или натуральная философия, как ее называли в Западной Европе) не играла почти никакой роли»[6 Грэхэм Л.Р. Очерки истории российской и совесткой науки. М. 1998. ]6. Однако с 1724 года, когда была основана Российская академия наук, ситуация коренным образом изменилась. Это был значительный шаг, который стал катализатором для ускорения развития научных исследований в России. Работа Академии наук оказала мощное влияние на прогресс в таких областях, как математика, механика, физика, астрономия, биология, химия, география и геология. Благодаря усилиям этого учреждения, Россия активно включилась в процесс международной научной жизни и значительно продвинулась в различных направлениях научного знания. В дополнение к развитию точных и естественных наук, гуманитарные дисциплины также достигли значительных высот, особенно в областях истории, экономики, литературной критики и, особенно, лингвистики. Выдающимся вкладом в развитие русского языкознания стала деятельность М.В. Ломоносова. Его знаменитое сочинение “Российская грамматика”(1755г.) положило начало системному анализу русского языка и стало фундаментом для его дальнейшей нормализации и стандартизации. Ломоносов активно выступал против чрезмерного использования тяжеловесных церковнославянских элементов в русской речи и противопоставлял им принципы ясности, точности и выразительности. Введенная им теория трех стилей — высокого, среднего и низкого — предоставила теоретические рамки для исследования огромного потенциала русского языка в чётком соответствии с различными литературными контекстами. Эти принципы существенно обогатили русскую литературную норму и способствовали формированию гибкой стилистики, соответствующей разным уровням общения и различным жанрам литературы. 4.Эпоха типографии: как печать содействовала лексикографии Технология печати была привнесена в Россию из Центральной Европы в середине XVI века[7 Яковлена М. Книгопечатание в России. —Альманах \\"Наследие\\". Москва. 2022 г. [Электронный ресурс]. URL: https://nasledie.digital/articles/knigopechatanie-v-rossii (дата обращения: 28.12.2023). ]7. Однако до XVIII века она не получила широкого распространения. В XVIII веке Петр Великий провёл значительную реформу письменности, в ходе которой была упрощена кириллица, и был введён новый гражданский шрифт для издания учебников и других светских книг. Эти меры способствовали возрастанию интереса к светской литературе, что стимулировало развитие книжной индустрии в России. В период правления императрицы Екатерины II книгопечатание в России испытало значительный подъём. Екатерина Великая поощряла просвещение и культуру, в том числе и развитие книжного дела, которое считалось неотъемлемой частью образования и наук. Увеличилось количество частных типографий, а также государственных печатных организаций. Это позволило расширить общее количество издаваемых книг и сделать их более доступными для различных слоёв населения. Согласно статистическим данным, за XVIII век было опубликовано примерно 95 тысяч различных изданий и около 200 разных журналов[8 Алексеев А.И., Измозик В.С., Куликов Ю.С. и др. Культурология. История культуры России: учебное пособие для студентов вузов. СПб. 2005. ]8. Такой рост публикаций способствовал распространению знаний и образования в России, укрепляя основы светского общества и культуры. 5.Языковое разнообразие и словарные инновации XVIII века До XVIII века русский язык развивался естественным образом без официального вмешательства. Письменный язык и общесвенно-повседневный язык представляли собой две независимые системы. Первый использовал церковнославянский язык, второй - русский. С началом XVIII века языковая обстановка стала многоязычной. С одной стороны, церковнославянский язык продолжал занимать важное положение в религиозных, государственных и культурных сферах. В то же время русский язык начал входить в письменную форму и его доля постепенно увеличивалась. С другой стороны, различные европейские языки проникали в Россию, принося с собой множество новых терминов и трудных слов, в основном в области технической терминологии. Это существенно обогатило лексику русского языка, но также усложнило языковую ситуацию. С середины XVIII века Романов, Карамзин и другие проводили теоретические и практические исследования, и русский язык “постепенно избавился от латинской структуры и ограничений древнеславянского лексикона, приблизившись к нормам живой и естественной разговорной речи”. заключение В Китае существует изречение “盛世修典” (shèng shì xiū diǎn), что переводится как “во времена расцвета – время создавать словари”.

Эти преобразования открыли России путь к активной интеграции в ряды могущественных европейских наций, что привело к расцвету Российской империи в период просветительского правления Екатерины II, когда государство достигло новых высот в искусстве, науке и культуре. 2.Образовательные маяки: от монастырских школ к университетам До наступления XVIII века система образования в России была преимущественно застывшей в рамках религиозных доктрин, и ограничивалась начальным обучением в приходских и монастырских училищах[4 李小桃[Ли Сяотао]. 俄国的教育与俄罗斯知识分子的诞生[Русское образование и рождение русской интеллигенции]. —外国语文[зарубежная филология]. 2009. № 5, С. 109-112. (на кит. яз.) ]4. Преображение образования было инициировано реформами Петра I, который положил начало светского учебного процесса. Блогодаря чему «были основаны светские профессиональные школы разного уровня, которые не только готовили специалистов различных профилей, но и давали общее образование»[5 РЕФОРМЫ ПЕТРА I В ОБЛАСТИ ОБРАЗОВАНИЯ // Большая российская энциклопедия. Том РОССИЯ. Москва, 2004, стр. 676-677. ]5. Дальнейшее укрепление направления в образовании пришлось на время основания Российской академии наук и ряд образовательных институтов в её структуре, что стало новым ключевым этапом в развитии национальной науки и образования. Особую веху в эволюции образовательной системы составило открытие Московского и Санкт-Петербургского университетов, которые в дальнейшем сыграли значительную роль в деле распространения светских знаний. В период правления Екатерины II были предприняты меры к демократизации образования, заключавшиеся в расширении его доступности для широких слоев населения. были основаны новые образовательные учреждения, в том числе и для женщин. Особую роль сыграл “Устав о народном училище” (1786 г.), который ознаменовал собой стремление к внедрению элементов просвещенного абсолютизма в образовательную практику, обозначив формирование системы народных школ с улучшенной программой для обеспечения более высокого уровня грамотности и профессиональной подготовки. 3.Научная ренессанс в России: академия наук и её влияние на словарное дело «В начале нового периода российской истории, вплоть до первых десятилетий восемнадцатого века, наука (или натуральная философия, как ее называли в Западной Европе) не играла почти никакой роли»[6 Грэхэм Л.Р. Очерки истории российской и совесткой науки. М. 1998. ]6. Однако с 1724 года, когда была основана Российская академия наук, ситуация коренным образом изменилась. Это был значительный шаг, который стал катализатором для ускорения развития научных исследований в России. Работа Академии наук оказала мощное влияние на прогресс в таких областях, как математика, механика, физика, астрономия, биология, химия, география и геология. Благодаря усилиям этого учреждения, Россия активно включилась в процесс международной научной жизни и значительно продвинулась в различных направлениях научного знания. В дополнение к развитию точных и естественных наук, гуманитарные дисциплины также достигли значительных высот, особенно в областях истории, экономики, литературной критики и, особенно, лингвистики. Выдающимся вкладом в развитие русского языкознания стала деятельность М.В. Ломоносова. Его знаменитое сочинение “Российская грамматика”(1755г.) положило начало системному анализу русского языка и стало фундаментом для его дальнейшей нормализации и стандартизации. Ломоносов активно выступал против чрезмерного использования тяжеловесных церковнославянских элементов в русской речи и противопоставлял им принципы ясности, точности и выразительности. Введенная им теория трех стилей — высокого, среднего и низкого — предоставила теоретические рамки для исследования огромного потенциала русского языка в чётком соответствии с различными литературными контекстами. Эти принципы существенно обогатили русскую литературную норму и способствовали формированию гибкой стилистики, соответствующей разным уровням общения и различным жанрам литературы. 4.Эпоха типографии: как печать содействовала лексикографии Технология печати была привнесена в Россию из Центральной Европы в середине XVI века[7 Яковлена М. Книгопечатание в России. —Альманах \\"Наследие\\". Москва. 2022 г. [Электронный ресурс]. URL: https://nasledie.digital/articles/knigopechatanie-v-rossii (дата обращения: 28.12.2023). ]7. Однако до XVIII века она не получила широкого распространения. В XVIII веке Петр Великий провёл значительную реформу письменности, в ходе которой была упрощена кириллица, и был введён новый гражданский шрифт для издания учебников и других светских книг. Эти меры способствовали возрастанию интереса к светской литературе, что стимулировало развитие книжной индустрии в России. В период правления императрицы Екатерины II книгопечатание в России испытало значительный подъём. Екатерина Великая поощряла просвещение и культуру, в том числе и развитие книжного дела, которое считалось неотъемлемой частью образования и наук. Увеличилось количество частных типографий, а также государственных печатных организаций. Это позволило расширить общее количество издаваемых книг и сделать их более доступными для различных слоёв населения. Согласно статистическим данным, за XVIII век было опубликовано примерно 95 тысяч различных изданий и около 200 разных журналов[8 Алексеев А.И., Измозик В.С., Куликов Ю.С. и др. Культурология. История культуры России: учебное пособие для студентов вузов. СПб. 2005. ]8. Такой рост публикаций способствовал распространению знаний и образования в России, укрепляя основы светского общества и культуры. 5.Языковое разнообразие и словарные инновации XVIII века До XVIII века русский язык развивался естественным образом без официального вмешательства. Письменный язык и общесвенно-повседневный язык представляли собой две независимые системы. Первый использовал церковнославянский язык, второй - русский. С началом XVIII века языковая обстановка стала многоязычной. С одной стороны, церковнославянский язык продолжал занимать важное положение в религиозных, государственных и культурных сферах. В то же время русский язык начал входить в письменную форму и его доля постепенно увеличивалась. С другой стороны, различные европейские языки проникали в Россию, принося с собой множество новых терминов и трудных слов, в основном в области технической терминологии. Это существенно обогатило лексику русского языка, но также усложнило языковую ситуацию. С середины XVIII века Романов, Карамзин и другие проводили теоретические и практические исследования, и русский язык “постепенно избавился от латинской структуры и ограничений древнеславянского лексикона, приблизившись к нормам живой и естественной разговорной речи”. заключение В Китае существует изречение “盛世修典” (shèng shì xiū diǎn), что переводится как “во времена расцвета – время создавать словари”. Это утверждение замечательно отображает чрезвычайную роль словарей в такой знаковой эпохе, как утверждение Российской империи. Благополучие страны не просто обеспечивает политическую и экономическую поддержку для лексикографии, но, что ещё важнее, в условиях динамичного развития и интеграции с западными державами, заметно острое отсутствие словарей, способных отразить новые явления, концепты и идеи. Именно это обстоятельство обусловило крайнюю важность работы над словарями в России в тот период, что привело к беспрецедентному росту количества и многообразия лексикографических изданий. Развитие школьного образования и множество новых учебных заведений создали потребность в специализированных образовательных словарях, предназначенных для учащихся и студентов всех уровней. Эти словари, авторство которых принадлежит учёным-академикам и преподавателям, таким как М.В. Ломоносов, И.А. Гейм, Ф. Гелтергоф и Н.Г. Курганов, стали инструментом для освоения разнообразных учебных дисциплин. Прогресс в естественных и гуманитарных науках века XVIII породил срочную потребность в актуализированных знаниях в данных сферах. Российская академия наук инициировала обширную программу перевода западноевропейских научных работ, что привело к притоку иностранных слов и концептов в русский лексикон и стало импульсом для создания различных лексикографических инструментов – от переводных словарей до словарей иностранных и непонятных слов, облегчающих перевод и понимание импортированного текстового материала. Специализированные знания, формирующиеся в различных областях науки, потребовали создания тематических словарей, что стало новым направлением в лексикографии XVIII века. В эру Екатерины II словари, посвящённые конкретным областям знания – химии, ботанике, медицине – стали неотъемлемыми справочниками для учёных и студентов, фиксирующими языковые стандарты и способствующими пониманию науки через язык. Важной образовательной миссией словарей XVIII века стало не просто пролегание пути для научной мысли, но и распространение знаний среди учёных и в более широких слоях общества. Они стали ключевым звеном в образовательном процессе, упорядочивая правила правописания, развивая филологические знания и обогащая русскую лексику. Тем самым, XVIII век ознаменовался началом новой эры в словарном деле – эпохой усиленной систематизации русского лексикона, установления литературных норм и закладки основ современного литературного русского языка, который продолжает развиваться и сегодня. Лексикография XVIII века, отражая комплекс социокультурных изменений, служит показателем значимых общественных и культурных трансформаций. Её развитие освещает не только зеркало научных достижений, но и культурный напор, манящий открыть новые горизонты знания и обогатить духовные аспекты общества. Таким образом, синтезирование языковых ресурсов с культурными требованиями времени проложило путь для последующих достижений в области изучения и использования русского языка, который продолжает созидать свою неповторимую историю языкового и культурного богатства. Заключая, можно уверенно сказать, что лексикографическое наследие XVIII века оказало прямое влияние на формирование русской языковой науки и продолжает оставаться важным ресурсом для современного языкового исследования и культурного понимания. Работа лексикографов XVIII века является бесценным подспорьем в разгадке того, как язык и общество соотносятся и взаимодействуют, создавая непрерывную цепь культурного развития и интеллектуального обогащения, протянувшуюся через века и всё ещё влияющую на лингвистическое сознание и идентичность.

Гак, 《从解释词典到语言百科全书（当代法国词典学经验）》，苏联科学院学报, 1971, № 6, 页 524-530。]1 中国学者雍和明在研究英语词典学历史时提出，每一个文化时期都有其基本的人文需求和特有的精神价值观，并且正是这些因素定义了相应的词典文化发展方向。[2 雍和明，《英语词典史》，北京, 2015。]2 深入解析十八世纪俄罗斯词典学发展背后的文化基础和社会背景需要考虑那个时代的历史背景。 长期以来，俄罗斯文化因地理和政治因素而与外界隔绝，但彼得大帝的即位标志着激进变革的开始。历史学家Шаповалов指出：“现代俄罗斯文明之源起于彼得大帝的改革和十八世纪的现代化过程。”[3 Шаповалов В.Ф,《俄罗斯文明的起源与意义》，莫斯科, 2003。]3 这些变革为俄罗斯开辟了与强大欧洲国家共同进步的道路，在叶卡捷琳娜大帝的启蒙统治期间，国家在艺术、科学和文化领域取得新的发展。 2. 教育改革：从修道院学校到大学 在十八世纪到来之前，俄罗斯的教育系统几乎完全停滞在宗教教义之内，主要限于教堂和修道院学校的初级教育。[4 李小桃，《俄国教育与俄罗斯知识分子的诞生》，《外国语文》, 2009, № 5, 页 109-112。]4 彼得大帝的改革开启了世俗教育进程。[5 涉及彼得大帝教育改革的文章，《大俄罗斯百科全书》，卷‘俄罗斯’，莫斯科, 2004, 页 676-677。]5 这些改革为成立俄罗斯科学院及其附属教育机构、开设莫斯科和圣彼得堡大学等新的教育机构奠定了基础，后者在普及世俗知识中起到了关键作用。 叶卡捷琳娜大帝在位期间，为了扩大教育的普及率并增进民主化，新的教育机构纷纷成立，包括为女性提供的教育机构。特别重要的是“1786年国民学校法”，标志着在教育实践中引入启蒙专制理念的决心，旨在建立带有改良课程的国民学校体系，以促进更高水平的识字率和职业训练。 3. 俄罗斯科学复兴：科学院及其对词典学的影响 至十八世纪初，“科学（或像西欧所说的自然哲学）在俄罗斯历史新时期几乎没有发挥任何作用。”[6 L.R. Graham,《俄罗斯和苏联科学史概览》，莫斯科, 1998。]6 然而，自1724年俄罗斯科学院成立以后，情况发生了根本性的转变。科学院对数学、力学、物理学、天文学、生物学、化学、地理学和地质学等领域的进步产生了深远的影响，并推动俄罗斯积极融入国际科学界。 除了精确和自然科学的突破，人文学科，特别是历史学、经济学、文学批评和语言学方面也取得了显著成就。M.V. Lomonosov 的杰出贡献推动了俄罗斯语言学的发展，他的著名著作《俄语语法》（1755年）为俄语系统分析奠定了基础，成为后续标准化和规范化的基石。 4. 印刷术时代：印刷术如何促进词典学 印刷术技术于十六世纪中叶从中央欧洲传入俄罗斯，[7 Яковлена М.《俄罗斯的书籍印刷》，《遗产》年鉴，莫斯科，2022年。[在线资源] URL：https://nasledie.digital/articles/knigopechatanie-v-rossii (访问日期：2023年12月28日)。]7 但到了十八世纪才开始普及。彼得大帝对书写体系进行重大改革，简化了西里尔字母，并引入了新的文民体用于出版教科书和其他世俗书籍。这些措施激发了对世俗文学的兴趣，并促进了俄罗斯书籍产业的发展。 叶卡捷琳娜大帝时期，书籍印刷业经历了显著的兴盛。叶卡捷琳娜大帝鼓励启蒙运动和文化发展，包括书籍事业的发展，认为这是教育和科学的重要组成部分。私人和国家印刷机构的数量增加，使得更多书籍得以更广泛地向公众发布。据统计，十八世纪约有9.5万种不同出版物和约200种不同杂志[8 Алексеев А.И.， Измозик В.С.， Куликов Ю.С. и другие，《文化学。俄罗斯文化史：高校学生教科书》，圣彼得堡，2005。] 8，这些出版物的增长有助于俄罗斯知识和教育的传播，巩固了世俗社会和文化基础。 5. 十八世纪语言多样性和词典创新 在十八世纪之前，俄语的发展是自然的，没有官方干预。书面语和日常语是两个独立的系统。前者使用教堂斯拉夫语，后者使用俄语。 自十八世纪开始，语言环境变成了多语言。一方面，教堂斯拉夫语在宗教、国家和文化领域继续占有重要地位。同时，俄语开始进入书面形式，其使用份额逐渐增加。另一方面，多种欧洲语言进入俄罗斯，带来许多新术语和困难用语，主要在技术术语领域。 这大大丰富了俄语词汇，但也使语言环境复杂化。从十八世纪中期开始，罗曼诺夫、卡拉姆津等人开展了理论和实践研究，俄语“逐渐摆脱了拉丁语构造和古斯拉夫词汇的限制，逼近了活生生自然谈话规范”。"},{"instruction":"Лексикографическое наследие России XVIII века: от социокультурного влияния к развитию словарей Аннотация: В статье рассматривается процесс становления и развития русской лексикографии в XVIII веке на фоне значительных социокультурных изменений. Исследование акцентирует внимание на взаимосвязи между социальными реформами, расширением образовательного горизонта и прогрессом в науке, и их последующим воздействием на словарную практику того времени. Анализируется вклад ведущих учёных-лексикографов и оценивается значимость словарных проектов как для развития русского языка, так и для культурного наследия в целом. Ключевые слова: лексикография, Россия XVIII век, социокультурные изменения, образовательные реформы, Российская академия наук, развитие науки, типография, языковое изобилие, словарные инновации, культурное наследие Введение: В период XVIII века Россия переживает эпоху значительных социальных трансформаций и культурного расцвета, сопровождающиеся активной лексикографической деятельностью. Словари становятся не просто собранием слов, но и отражением динамически развивающегося общества, а также инструментом для фиксации и распространения знаний в различных сферах жизни. Настоящее исследование направлено на осмысление лексикографии как зеркала эпохи, выявление социальных движущих сил и понимание культурного воздействия словарей на формирование современного литературного русского языка. Мы знакомимся с пионерами словарного дела, их трудами и прослеживаем, как изменения в образовательной политике, науке и типографском искусстве повлияли на лексикографию, привнося инновации не только в структуру словарных изданий, но и во взгляды на язык и его изучение. 1. Реформы и инновации: двигатели лексикографии в России века XVIII Французский лексикограф Алан Рей эмфатично утверждает: «Современная цивилизация — это цивилизация словарей»[1 Гак В.Г. От толкового словаря к энциклопедии языка (Из опыта современной французской лексикографии). —Известия АН СССР. 1971. № 6, С. 524-530.]1. Подобное мнение делится и китайский учёный Юн Хэ Мин, который рассматривая историю английской лексикографии, отмечает, что в каждой культурной эпохе свой набор первостепенных гуманитарных потребностей и характерных духовных ценностей, именно они задают вектор развития соответствующей культуры словарей. Эти словари интегрируют в себя ключевые черты цивилизации и духовные устремления эпохи, становясь её ярким отражением[2 雍和明[Юн Хэмин]. 英语词典史[История английской лексикографии ]. 北京 [Пекин]. 2015. (на кит. яз.)]2. Ответ на вопрос о культурной основе и социальном контексте, которые способствовали развитию лексикографии в России XVIII века, требует рассмотрения исторического фона того периода. Длительное время российская культура была обособлена вследствие географических и политических факторов, однако с воцарением Петра I начался период радикальных перемен. Историк Шаповалов по этому поводу отмечает: «Истоки современной российской цивилизации закладываются в реформах Петра I и процессе модернизации XVIII века»[3 Шаповалов В.Ф. Истоки и смысл российской цивилизации. М. 2003. ]3. Эти преобразования открыли России путь к активной интеграции в ряды могущественных европейских наций, что привело к расцвету Российской империи в период просветительского правления Екатерины II, когда государство достигло новых высот в искусстве, науке и культуре. 2.Образовательные маяки: от монастырских школ к университетам До наступления XVIII века система образования в России была преимущественно застывшей в рамках религиозных доктрин, и ограничивалась начальным обучением в приходских и монастырских училищах[4 李小桃[Ли Сяотао]. 俄国的教育与俄罗斯知识分子的诞生[Русское образование и рождение русской интеллигенции]. —外国语文[зарубежная филология]. 2009. № 5, С. 109-112.

Благополучие страны не просто обеспечивает политическую и экономическую поддержку для лексикографии, но, что ещё важнее, в условиях динамичного развития и интеграции с западными державами, заметно острое отсутствие словарей, способных отразить новые явления, концепты и идеи. Именно это обстоятельство обусловило крайнюю важность работы над словарями в России в тот период, что привело к беспрецедентному росту количества и многообразия лексикографических изданий. Развитие школьного образования и множество новых учебных заведений создали потребность в специализированных образовательных словарях, предназначенных для учащихся и студентов всех уровней.

Лексикография XVIII века, отражая комплекс социокультурных изменений, служит показателем значимых общественных и культурных трансформаций. Её развитие освещает не только зеркало научных достижений, но и культурный напор, манящий открыть новые горизонты знания и обогатить духовные аспекты общества. Таким образом, синтезирование языковых ресурсов с культурными требованиями времени проложило путь для последующих достижений в области изучения и использования русского языка, который продолжает созидать свою неповторимую историю языкового и культурного богатства. Заключая, можно уверенно сказать, что лексикографическое наследие XVIII века оказало прямое влияние на формирование русской языковой науки и продолжает оставаться важным ресурсом для современного языкового исследования и культурного понимания. Работа лексикографов XVIII века является бесценным подспорьем в разгадке того, как язык и общество соотносятся и взаимодействуют, создавая непрерывную цепь культурного развития и интеллектуального обогащения, протянувшуюся через века и всё ещё влияющую на лингвистическое сознание и идентичность.

Важным импульсом к модернизации словарного состава стали петровские преобразования, направленные на сближение России с Европой, а также образовательные нововведения Екатерины Великой, включая демократизацию доступа к образованию и основание университетов, что усилило потребность в научной и учебной литературе. Словари того времени отражали динамику социокультурных процессов, фиксируя как появление новых слов и значений, так и развитие научных дисциплин, которым способствовало образование Российской академии наук. Постепенное разделение письменного и разговорного языка выдвинуло новые требования к языковым ресурсам, вызвав необходимость в толковых и тематических словарях для разнообразных сфер деятельности. Развитие книгопечатания, стимулированное реформами и поддержкой просвещения, способствовало распространению литературных и научных знаний, а также повышению грамотности. Появление разнообразных типов словарей, как многоязычных, так и одноязычных, ориентированных на пользователей разного уровня, стало свидетельством растущего языкового богатства и духовного поиска. Синтез языковых ресурсов и культурных требований стал основой для дальнейших достижений в изучении русского языка, а лексикографическое наследие XVIII века прочно вошло в культурное надбавление народов России, сохраняя свою актуальность и в современном научном и культурном контексте.

Словари становятся не просто собранием слов, но и отражением динамически развивающегося общества, а также инструментом для фиксации и распространения знаний в различных сферах жизни. Настоящее исследование направлено на осмысление лексикографии как зеркала эпохи, выявление социальных движущих сил и понимание культурного воздействия словарей на формирование современного литературного русского языка. Мы знакомимся с пионерами словарного дела, их трудами и прослеживаем, как изменения в образовательной политике, науке и типографском искусстве повлияли на лексикографию, привнося инновации не только в структуру словарных изданий, но и во взгляды на язык и его изучение. 1. Реформы и инновации: двигатели лексикографии в России века XVIII Французский лексикограф Алан Рей эмфатично утверждает: «Современная цивилизация — это цивилизация словарей»[1 Гак В.Г. От толкового словаря к энциклопедии языка (Из опыта современной французской лексикографии). —Известия АН СССР. 1971. № 6, С. 524-530.]1. Подобное мнение делится и китайский учёный Юн Хэ Мин, который рассматривая историю английской лексикографии, отмечает, что в каждой культурной эпохе свой набор первостепенных гуманитарных потребностей и характерных духовных ценностей, именно они задают вектор развития соответствующей культуры словарей. Эти словари интегрируют в себя ключевые черты цивилизации и духовные устремления эпохи, становясь её ярким отражением[2 雍和明[Юн Хэмин]. 英语词典史[История английской лексикографии ]. 北京 [Пекин]. 2015. (на кит. яз.)]2. Ответ на вопрос о культурной основе и социальном контексте, которые способствовали развитию лексикографии в России XVIII века, требует рассмотрения исторического фона того периода. Длительное время российская культура была обособлена вследствие географических и политических факторов, однако с воцарением Петра I начался период радикальных перемен. Историк Шаповалов по этому поводу отмечает: «Истоки современной российской цивилизации закладываются в реформах Петра I и процессе модернизации XVIII века»[3 Шаповалов В.Ф. Истоки и смысл российской цивилизации. М. 2003. ]3. Эти преобразования открыли России путь к активной интеграции в ряды могущественных европейских наций, что привело к расцвету Российской империи в период просветительского правления Екатерины II, когда государство достигло новых высот в искусстве, науке и культуре. 2.Образовательные маяки: от монастырских школ к университетам До наступления XVIII века система образования в России была преимущественно застывшей в рамках религиозных доктрин, и ограничивалась начальным обучением в приходских и монастырских училищах[4 李小桃[Ли Сяотао]. 俄国的教育与俄罗斯知识分子的诞生[Русское образование и рождение русской интеллигенции]. —外国语文[зарубежная филология]. 2009. № 5, С. 109-112. (на кит. яз.) ]4. Преображение образования было инициировано реформами Петра I, который положил начало светского учебного процесса. Блогодаря чему «были основаны светские профессиональные школы разного уровня, которые не только готовили специалистов различных профилей, но и давали общее образование»[5 РЕФОРМЫ ПЕТРА I В ОБЛАСТИ ОБРАЗОВАНИЯ // Большая российская энциклопедия. Том РОССИЯ. Москва, 2004, стр. 676-677. ]5. Дальнейшее укрепление направления в образовании пришлось на время основания Российской академии наук и ряд образовательных институтов в её структуре, что стало новым ключевым этапом в развитии национальной науки и образования. Особую веху в эволюции образовательной системы составило открытие Московского и Санкт-Петербургского университетов, которые в дальнейшем сыграли значительную роль в деле распространения светских знаний. В период правления Екатерины II были предприняты меры к демократизации образования, заключавшиеся в расширении его доступности для широких слоев населения. были основаны новые образовательные учреждения, в том числе и для женщин. Особую роль сыграл “Устав о народном училище” (1786 г.), который ознаменовал собой стремление к внедрению элементов просвещенного абсолютизма в образовательную практику, обозначив формирование системы народных школ с улучшенной программой для обеспечения более высокого уровня грамотности и профессиональной подготовки. 3.Научная ренессанс в России: академия наук и её влияние на словарное дело «В начале нового периода российской истории, вплоть до первых десятилетий восемнадцатого века, наука (или натуральная философия, как ее называли в Западной Европе) не играла почти никакой роли»[6 Грэхэм Л.Р. Очерки истории российской и совесткой науки. М. 1998. ]6. Однако с 1724 года, когда была основана Российская академия наук, ситуация коренным образом изменилась. Это был значительный шаг, который стал катализатором для ускорения развития научных исследований в России. Работа Академии наук оказала мощное влияние на прогресс в таких областях, как математика, механика, физика, астрономия, биология, химия, география и геология. Благодаря усилиям этого учреждения, Россия активно включилась в процесс международной научной жизни и значительно продвинулась в различных направлениях научного знания. В дополнение к развитию точных и естественных наук, гуманитарные дисциплины также достигли значительных высот, особенно в областях истории, экономики, литературной критики и, особенно, лингвистики. Выдающимся вкладом в развитие русского языкознания стала деятельность М.В. Ломоносова. Его знаменитое сочинение “Российская грамматика”(1755г.) положило начало системному анализу русского языка и стало фундаментом для его дальнейшей нормализации и стандартизации. Ломоносов активно выступал против чрезмерного использования тяжеловесных церковнославянских элементов в русской речи и противопоставлял им принципы ясности, точности и выразительности. Введенная им теория трех стилей — высокого, среднего и низкого — предоставила теоретические рамки для исследования огромного потенциала русского языка в чётком соответствии с различными литературными контекстами. Эти принципы существенно обогатили русскую литературную норму и способствовали формированию гибкой стилистики, соответствующей разным уровням общения и различным жанрам литературы. 4.Эпоха типографии: как печать содействовала лексикографии Технология печати была привнесена в Россию из Центральной Европы в середине XVI века[7 Яковлена М. Книгопечатание в России. —Альманах “Наследие”. Москва. 2022 г. [Электронный ресурс]. URL: https://nasledie.digital/articles/knigopechatanie-v-rossii (дата обращения: 28.12.2023). ]7. Однако до XVIII века она не получила широкого распространения. В XVIII веке Петр Великий провёл значительную реформу письменности, в ходе которой была упрощена кириллица, и был введён новый гражданский шрифт для издания учебников и других светских книг. Эти меры способствовали возрастанию интереса к светской литературе, что стимулировало развитие книжной индустрии в России. В период правления императрицы Екатерины II книгопечатание в России испытало значительный подъём. Екатерина Великая поощряла просвещение и культуру, в том числе и развитие книжного дела, которое считалось неотъемлемой частью образования и наук. Увеличилось количество частных типографий, а также государственных печатных организаций. Это позволило расширить общее количество издаваемых книг и сделать их более доступными для различных слоёв населения. Согласно статистическим данным, за XVIII век было опубликовано примерно 95 тысяч различных изданий и около 200 разных журналов[8 Алексеев А.И., Измозик В.С., Куликов Ю.С. и др. Культурология. История культуры России: учебное пособие для студентов вузов. СПб. 2005. ]8. Такой рост публикаций способствовал распространению знаний и образования в России, укрепляя основы светского общества и культуры. 5.Языковое разнообразие и словарные инновации XVIII века До XVIII века русский язык развивался естественным образом без официального вмешательства. Письменный язык и общесвенно-повседневный язык представляли собой две независимые системы. Первый использовал церковнославянский язык, второй - русский. С началом XVIII века языковая обстановка стала многоязычной. С одной стороны, церковнославянский язык продолжал занимать важное положение в религиозных, государственных и культурных сферах. В то же время русский язык начал входить в письменную форму и его доля постепенно увеличивалась. С другой стороны, различные европейские языки проникали в Россию, принося с собой множество новых терминов и трудных слов, в основном в области технической терминологии. Это существенно обогатило лексику русского языка, но также усложнило языковую ситуацию. С середины XVIII века Романов, Карамзин и другие проводили теоретические и практические исследования, и русский язык “постепенно избавился от латинской структуры и ограничений древнеславянского лексикона, приблизившись к нормам живой и естественной разговорной речи”. заключение В Китае существует изречение “盛世修典” (shèng shì xiū diǎn), что переводится как “во времена расцвета – время создавать словари”. Это утверждение замечательно отображает чрезвычайную роль словарей в такой знаковой эпохе, как утверждение Российской империи. Благополучие страны не просто обеспечивает политическую и экономическую поддержку для лексикографии, но, что ещё важнее, в условиях динамичного развития и интеграции с западными державами, заметно острое отсутствие словарей, способных отразить новые явления, концепты и идеи. Именно это обстоятельство обусловило крайнюю важность работы над словарями в России в тот период, что привело к беспрецедентному росту количества и многообразия лексикографических изданий. Развитие школьного образования и множество новых учебных заведений создали потребность в специализированных образовательных словарях, предназначенных для учащихся и студентов всех уровней. Эти словари, авторство которых принадлежит учёным-академикам и преподавателям, таким как М.В. Ломоносов, И.А. Гейм, Ф. Гелтергоф и Н.Г. Курганов, стали инструментом для освоения разнообразных учебных дисциплин. Прогресс в естественных и гуманитарных науках века XVIII породил срочную потребность в актуализированных знаниях в данных сферах. Российская академия наук инициировала обширную программу перевода западноевропейских научных работ, что привело к притоку иностранных слов и концептов в русский лексикон и стало импульсом для создания различных лексикографических инструментов – от переводных словарей до словарей иностранных и непонятных слов, облегчающих перевод и понимание импортированного текстового материала. Специализированные знания, формирующиеся в различных областях науки, потребовали создания тематических словарей, что стало новым направлением в лексикографии XVIII века. В эру Екатерины II словари, посвящённые конкретным областям знания – химии, ботанике, медицине – стали неотъемлемыми справочниками для учёных и студентов, фиксирующими языковые стандарты и способствующими пониманию науки через язык. Важной образовательной миссией словарей XVIII века стало не просто пролегание пути для научной мысли, но и распространение знаний среди учёных и в более широких слоях общества. Они стали ключевым звеном в образовательном процессе, упорядочивая правила правописания, развивая филологические знания и обогащая русскую лексику. Тем самым, XVIII век ознаменовался началом новой эры в словарном деле – эпохой усиленной систематизации русского лексикона, установления литературных норм и закладки основ современного литературного русского языка, который продолжает развиваться и сегодня. Лексикография XVIII века, отражая комплекс социокультурных изменений, служит показателем значимых общественных и культурных трансформаций. Её развитие освещает не только зеркало научных достижений, но и культурный напор, манящий открыть новые горизонты знания и обогатить духовные аспекты общества. Таким образом, синтезирование языковых ресурсов с культурными требованиями времени проложило путь для последующих достижений в области изучения и использования русского языка, который продолжает созидать свою неповторимую историю языкового и культурного богатства. Заключая, можно уверенно сказать, что лексикографическое наследие XVIII века оказало прямое влияние на формирование русской языковой науки и продолжает оставаться важным ресурсом для современного языкового исследования и культурного понимания. Работа лексикографов XVIII века является бесценным подспорьем в разгадке того, как язык и общество соотносятся и взаимодействуют, создавая непрерывную цепь культурного развития и интеллектуального обогащения, протянувшуюся через века и всё ещё влияющую на лингвистическое сознание и идентичность. улучшите статью, исключите повторения одного и того же содержания в разных абзацах для сжатия","output":"Лексикографическое наследие России XVIII века: от социокультурного влияния к развитию словарей Аннотация: Исследование посвящено анализу становления русской лексикографии XVIII века, подчёркивается влияние социальных реформ, научного прогресса и образования.

Please note that these are general overviews based on the given topics. Anyone considering substantial dietary changes or medical-based weight loss solutions should consult with healthcare professionals. --- **1. Rapid Weight Loss: High Protein Diet** Losing weight rapidly has become a primary health goal for many. A high protein diet has been lauded for its effectiveness in promoting quick weight loss. Proteins are essential macronutrients that help build muscle, repair tissue, and produce enzymes and hormones. But how does a high protein diet contribute to weight loss? First, a high protein intake boosts metabolism, leading to an increase in calorie burn. This is due to the thermic effect of food, which is the energy required to digest, absorb, and metabolize nutrients. Proteins have a higher thermic effect compared to fats and carbohydrates, meaning more calories are burned during digestion. Secondly, proteins contribute to satiety, the feeling of fullness after eating. By consuming a protein-rich meal, you're likely to feel full for a longer period, reducing overall calorie intake by curbing the desire to snack between meals. A diet rich in lean meats, fish, eggs, dairy products, legumes, and nuts not only supports muscle maintenance and growth, which is vital for a well-functioning metabolism but also helps in managing weight. It is essential, however, to balance protein intake with other food groups and not exceed the recommended daily allowance of protein, as excess consumption can lead to health issues. Weight loss should always be approached responsibly and sustainably. A high protein diet might help with rapid weight loss, but it must be part of a well-rounded, nutritious daily eating plan tailored to individual needs. **2. Metabolism Boost: Low Carb Diet Veggies & Fruit** Boosting metabolism is a key component in the weight loss equation. A popular approach for doing this is through a low-carbohydrate diet that emphasizes veggies and fruits. Low carb diets reduce the intake of sugars and starches, the body's primary sources of glucose. By cutting down on these, the body is forced to burn stored fat for energy, aiding in weight loss. However, vegetables and fruits play a unique role in this diet. They are loaded with vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants while being low in calories and carbs. For instance, leafy greens like spinach, kale, and lettuce have minimal carbohydrates. Cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts are also low in carbs but high in fiber, which can improve digestive health and enhance the feeling of fullness. Fruits, while typically higher in sugar than vegetables, can still be a part of a low carb diet if selected carefully. Berries, such as raspberries, blackberries, and strawberries, pack a lot of flavor and nutrition without an excess of sugar. Incorporating a variety of colorful, low carb veggies and fruits can bolster the body's metabolism by providing essential nutrients that support various bodily functions, including thyroid and liver function, which are critical to metabolic rate. **3. Weight Loss Injections: Tirzepatide & Semaglutide** The quest to combat obesity has led to the development of weight loss injections, a breakthrough for those struggling with significant weight management. Notably, Tirzepatide and Semaglutide have shown promising results in clinical trials. Tirzepatide is a novel medication that mimics the effects of two hormones that target areas in the brain which regulate appetite and food intake. The dual action of these hormones can reduce hunger and increase feelings of fullness, leading to a significant reduction in body weight. This treatment has been used in conjunction with dietary changes and exercise to achieve better results. Semaglutide, on the other hand, was initially used to treat type 2 diabetes but has also been found effective in weight management. It performs a role similar to the naturally occurring hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which regulates appetite and calorie intake. Both medications are administered through injections and have been associated with encouraging weight loss outcomes. However, they are prescription-based and not suitable for everyone. They may come with side effects and risks, which necessitates a thorough medical evaluation before starting treatment. These injections are not standalone solutions and should be combined with lifestyle modifications for optimal effectiveness. They represent a cutting-edge addition to the arsenal of tools for combating obesity and its related health issues. **4. Lose More: Maintenance – Maintain A Healthy Weight** Maintaining a healthy weight is often more challenging than losing weight. However, it is crucial for overall well-being and in preventing the yo-yo effect of weight loss and gain. After achieving weight loss goals, the focus should shift to maintenance, which involves several key strategies. A balanced diet that aligns with one's energy needs is central to maintenance. This means managing portion sizes and choosing nutrient-dense foods that are high in fiber and protein to help maintain satiety. Regular physical activity is also a key component. The American Heart Association recommends at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity, complemented by muscle-strengthening exercises. Moreover, behavioral strategies play a crucial role in weight maintenance. Keeping a food diary, planning meals ahead, and mindful eating can prevent overeating and help in making healthier choices. Social support from friends, family, or weight-loss communities can provide the necessary motivation and accountability to keep the weight off. Additionally, addressing emotional and psychological factors that may contribute to weight gain is important. In the end, weight maintenance is about establishing a new normal—a lifestyle you can live with and enjoy long-term. It's about making smart, sustainable changes, not about perfection. With the right mindset and support, maintaining a healthy weight is an achievable and worthwhile goal. Remember, each individual's journey is unique, and finding what works best for you is a personal process."},{"instruction":"snake game","output":"The Snake game is a classic video game that dates back to the late 1970s. It gained immense popularity in the late 1990s when it was pre-installed on Nokia mobile phones. Here is a basic description of the game and how to play it: Objective: The objective of the game is to control a snake and eat items that appear on the screen. Each item the snake eats makes the snake longer. The game ends if the snake runs into the screen boundary or into itself. Basic Rules: 1. The snake moves continuously in the direction it is headed. 2. The player uses the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) or similar controls to change the direction of the snake's movement. 3. Each time the snake eats an item (often depicted as a dot or an apple), it grows in length. 4. As the snake grows, it becomes more challenging to avoid collision with the snake's own body or the game area boundaries. 5. The speed of the snake may increase as it consumes more items or as the game progresses, increasing the difficulty. 6. The goal is to survive as long as possible, obtaining a high score based on the number of items eaten. If you're interested in programming your own simple version of the Snake game, you could use various programming languages like Python with libraries such as Pygame, JavaScript with HTML5 Canvas, or any other language that allows for graphical display output. Here is a very simplified pseudo-code for a Snake game, which should give you a basic understanding of the logic behind it: \`\`\`pseudo initialize game area initialize snake at a starting position initialize score to 0 place first item in the game area randomly while game is not over: wait for player input to change direction update snake's position based on direction if snake's new head position overlaps with the item: increase score lengthen snake place a new item randomly in the area if snake collides with itself or the boundaries: set game over to true display final score \`\`\` Actual implementation requires handling many more details, such as how to track the snake's body segments, manage game timing, user input, and graphics. If you're interested in creating the game, you'd want to get familiar with a programming language and a relevant framework or library to handle the graphics and user input for the game."},{"instruction":"I am currently working to create a stated preference survey based on choice based conjoint analysis.

When you have a large number of possible profiles, as is your case with 108 combinations (3^3 * 2^2), it may not be feasible or desirable to present all of them to each respondent due to the cognitive burden and time constraints. Here are some steps to select a manageable subset of profiles to present to the audience: 1. Experimental Design: You need to create a smaller, statistically efficient experimental design from the full set of possible profiles. This design should maintain the orthogonality and balance of the attributes as much as possible, meaning that each attribute level should appear with equal frequency and be independent of other levels. 2. Use Software or Statistical Techniques: There are specialized software packages and statistical techniques such as orthogonal arrays, fractional factorial designs, and optimal designs that can help you with this task. For choice experiments, software like Sawtooth, Conjoint.ly, and R with the 'ChoiceModelR' or 'AlgDesign' packages can generate efficient experimental designs. 3. Number of Tasks: Decide on the number of choice tasks that each respondent will be asked to complete. A typical CBC survey might have anywhere from 8 to 16 tasks per respondent. 4. Construction of Choice Sets: Once you have your design and know the number of tasks, group the profiles into choice sets. Each choice set should contain a number of profiles (usually 2 to 5) from which the respondent will choose their preferred option. 5. Include a \\"None\\" Option: Consider including a \\"none of these\\" option in each choice set. This can be particularly informative as it allows you to capture the idea that the respondent might prefer to opt out if their ideal combination of attributes is not presented. 6. Balance and Overlap: Ensure balance and overlap across tasks. Balance means that each level of each attribute appears approximately the same number of times across all tasks. Overlap refers to the presence of some attribute levels appearing more than once within the same task, which helps with the estimation of interaction effects. 7. Pilot Test: Before rolling out the full survey, conduct a pilot test with a small sample of respondents to ensure the choice sets are understandable and the time required to complete the survey is reasonable. 8. Consider Randomization: Randomize the order of the choice sets and the order of the profiles within each choice set to minimize order bias. By following these steps and using statistical software, you should be able to reduce the number of profiles significantly while still obtaining a robust and reliable measure of preferences. Remember that while a reduced design simplifies the task for respondents, it is essential to ensure that the design is capable of estimating the effects you are interested in (main effects and potentially interactions). Keep in mind that the more complex the design (i.e., more levels or interactions you wish to estimate), the more profiles you may need to include."},{"instruction":"snake game in phyton codes","output":"Creating a simple Snake game in Python typically involves using a module to create a graphical interface.

This proclivity is seen as evidence of an intrinsic recognition of divine presence, or at least the idea of something greater than ourselves. Critics of atheism often point to this universal tendency as an indication that atheism goes against a fundamental human trait: the propensity to seek connection with the sacred or the supernatural. They may assert that by denying the existence of God, atheists are not only in the minority but are also rejecting a core aspect of what has historically and psychologically been an inherent aspect of human consciousness and social structure."},{"instruction":"give me a 500 word paragraph against athiests using: people inherently believe in God","output":"One of the principal arguments leveled against atheism is based on the assertion that a belief in God, or at least a higher power, is an innate aspect of the human condition, a sentiment hardwired into our very being from the dawn of our existence. Across disparate cultures and epochs, humanity has consistently erected structures of belief that transcend material existence, often postulating deities or spiritual systems to explain the mysteries of the universe, giving rise to a myriad of religions and spiritual practices that seek to connect the human experience with something more profound than the observable world. It is this universal proclivity toward spirituality and the metaphysical that stands as a testament to the inherent inclination to believe in God or gods. Advocates of this perspective argue that atheism fails to take into account this intrinsic aspect of human nature, effectively isolating the individual from a shared human legacy of searching for meaning beyond the physical realm. Those who critique atheism from this standpoint further contend that the historical persistence and prevalence of religious belief indicate not only a collective psychological need but also suggest the existence of an underlying truth to the notion of the divine. From shamanic traditions to the world's major religions, the diversity of faiths speaks to the versatility of this inherent drive, but also to the commonality of its core inspiration: the belief in something greater than ourselves. Detailed anthropological studies have often highlighted the role that religion plays in the moral and ethical structuring of societies, as well as in forming community cohesion and individual identity. By renouncing the belief in God, atheists are perceived to reject a key foundation of human culture and social solidarity, depriving themselves, and potentially others, of the comfort, guidance, and sense of purpose that these belief systems often provide. Furthermore, some proponents of the view that belief is inherent claim that atheism overlooks the transcendent experiences reported by numerous individuals, experiences that are frequently characterized as spiritual or divine in nature. These moments, when individuals report feelings of awe, connection, or enlightenment, are cited as intuitive evidence for the existence of a reality beyond the physical—one that connects all beings and is more readily ascribed to the presence of a divine force than to mere neurological processes. While atheists might attribute such experiences to natural phenomena, their prevalence and impact cannot be dismissed and suggest a universal cognitive framework that is aligned with the recognition of a higher power. Critics also argue that religious belief has given rise to monumental achievements in art, literature, and architecture, revealing the splendor and depth of the human spirit moved by the divine. Atheism, in eschewing this connection, might be seen as undermining the inspiration behind such achievements and suggesting that the creative impulses which have driven humanity to its greatest heights of expression are mere byproducts of an unguided evolutionary process, rather than reflections of the divine spark within the human soul. In essence, those who hold the viewpoint that people inherently believe in God see atheism as not just a simple disbelief in deities, but as a fundamental misreading of a key component of human existence. They argue that to ignore the deep-seated human propensity toward belief is to overlook a significant element of what it means to be human, as well as to deny the possibility that this shared inclination points towards an underlying spiritual reality. While atheism advocates for a worldview predicated on empirical evidence and rational inquiry, its detractors maintain that it falls short in accounting for and valuing the profound sense of the sacred that has shaped human life and culture throughout the ages."},{"instruction":"что делает этот метод на Smali и что это за zzc: .method public getPurchaseState()I .locals 2 iget-object v0, p0, Lcom/android/billingclient/api/Purchase;->zzc:Lorg/json/JSONObject; const-string v1, “purchaseState” const/4 v2, 0x1 invoke-virtual {v0, v1, v2}, Lorg/json/JSONObject;->optInt(Ljava/lang/String;I)I move-result v0 const/4 v1, 0x4 if-eq v0, v1, :cond_d return v2 :cond_d const/4 v0, 0x2 return v0 .end method","output":"Этот метод, написанный на языке Smali для выполнения на платформе Android, представляет собой декомпилированное представление Java метода \`getPurchaseState()\`, который возвращает статус покупки в виде целого числа (int). Вот что делает метод: 1. Сначала из объекта покупки (объект \`Purchase\`) получается значение поля \`zzc\`. Поле \`zzc\` — это экземпляр класса \`JSONObject\`, который содержит информацию о покупке в формате JSON. 2. Далее используется метод \`optInt\` класса \`JSONObject\` для извлечения целого числа, ассоциированного с ключом \`\\"purchaseState\\"\`. Если ключ отсутствует, то по умолчанию возвращается значение \`1\` (\`0x1\` в шестнадцатеричном представлении). 3. Полученное значение сохраняется в локальной переменной \`v0\`. 4. После этого происходит сравнение значения \`v0\` с числом \`4\` (\`0x4\` в шестнадцатеричном представлении). 5. Если значение \`v0\` равно \`4\`, то метод возвращает \`2\` (\`0x2\` в шестнадцатеричном представлении). 6. В противном случае (если \`v0\` не равно \`4\`), метод возвращает \`1\` (\`0x1\` в шестнадцатеричном представлении). В итоге метод \`getPurchaseState()\` используется для определения текущего статуса покупки на основе информации в JSON объекте. Если информация о статусе покупки равна \`4\`, то возвращается \`2\`, иначе возвращается \`1\`. Эти значения могут соответствовать различным статусам покупки в исходной программе. Например, они могут означать что-то вроде \\"куплено\\", \\"ожидается оплата\\" и т.д., но для точного понимания значений необходимо знать контекст использования этого метода в приложении."},{"instruction":"Не пойму что же тогда может означать что покупка прошла?","output":"Статус покупки определяется на основе значения, возвращаемого методом \`getPurchaseState()\`. Однако, чтобы точно интерпретировать значения возвращаемые этим методом, необходимо иметь контекст или документацию, относящуюся к конкретному приложению или API, с которым он взаимодействует. В данном случае, мы рассматриваем покупку через Google Billing Client API. Согласно документации Google Billing Client API, \`purchaseState\` может принимать следующие значения: - \`0\`: Purchase state \`PURCHASED\` (покупка совершена успешно). - \`1\`: Purchase state \`PENDING\` (покупка ожидает подтверждения, например, если пользователь выбрал способ оплаты, который требует время для обработки). - \`2 или любые другие значения\`: Purchase state \`UNSPECIFIED_STATE\` (статус покупки не указан или неизвестен). Исходя из вышесказанного, метод \`getPurchaseState()\` на Smali делает следующее: 1. Если \`purchaseState\` полученный из JSON объекта равен \`4\`, то метод возвращает \`2\`, что, вероятно, связано с неким специфичным для конкретного приложения или API состоянием покупки, и это состояние за пределами стандартной документации Google Billing API. 2. Для всех других значений \`purchaseState\` метод возвращает \`1\`. Это поведение не соответствует стандартным значениям из документации Google Billing API, где успешная покупка обозначается числом \`0\`. Поэтому мы можем предположить, что приложение, из которого был извлечен данный Smali код, использует собственные константы или логику для представления состояний покупки. Чтобы получить точный ответ на вопрос о значении статуса \\"покупка прошла\\", необходимо обратиться к документации приложения или к исходному коду (если он доступен), который использует этот метод. Smali код, который у нас есть, лишь даёт понимание того, какие значения этот метод может возвращать, и как они вычислены, но не даёт информацию о том, как эти значения интерпретируются в контексте приложения."},{"instruction":"То есть этот код не будет совершать покупку: # Lcom/android/billingclient/api/Purchase;

А какая библиотека, класс, метод стандартно обозначает покупку?","output":"В Android приложениях для обработки покупок через Google Play Store используется Google Play Billing Library. Класс \`Purchase\` является частью этой библиотеки и содержит всю информацию о совершенной покупке. В более старых версиях (Play Billing Library версии 2 и ранее) метод \`getPurchaseState()\` класса \`Purchase\` возвращал статус покупки, и вот какие были значения: - \`0\`: \`PURCHASED\` - Покупка успешно завершена. - \`1\`: \`PENDING\` - Покупка в ожидании подтверждения (не завершена). - \`2\`: \`UNSPECIFIED_STATE\` - Неизвестное состояние покупки. Начиная с Play Billing Library версии 3 и выше, для проверки успешности покупки часто используется класс \`BillingResult\`, который содержит код состояния операции (\`responseCode\`) и может содержать другую информацию, такую как сообщения об ошибках. Чтобы инициировать процесс покупки, нужно использовать классы \`BillingClient\` и \`SkuDetails\`. \`BillingClient\` предоставляет API для взаимодействия с сервисом биллинга Google Play, а \`SkuDetails\` содержит информацию о продукте (также известном как SKU - Stock Keeping Unit), который вы хотите продать. Процесс покупки начинается с создания интента покупки, и покупки обычно производятся примерно так: 1. Создаётся экземпляр \`BillingClient\` и подключается к Google Play. 2. Загружается список доступных продуктов (\`SkuDetails\`) со всей необходимой информацией о товарах. 3. Формируется покупка через вызов метода \`launchBillingFlow()\` для \`BillingClient\`, передавая активити и параметры покупки. 4. Результат покупки возвращается в \`onPurchasesUpdated()\` для слушателя \`PurchasesUpdatedListener\`. Покупки также необходимо подтверждать (acknowledge), если они не являются разовыми (как в случае с подписками), чтобы обеспечить доставку товара или услуги пользователю и финализировать транзакцию. Для написания кода, который обрабатывает покупки, вы должны использовать официальную документацию Google Play Billing Library в качестве основного источника информации, так как она предоставляет самую точную и актуальную информацию о том, как реализован и как должен работать процесс биллинга."},{"instruction":"А если это bikling 6.0.0 ведь очевидно что это и есть класс Purchases с входящими методами.

Ее значение равно \`0x2\`, т.е. \`2\`. - \`PURCHASED\`: Покупка успешно совершена. Ее значение равно \`0x1\`, т.е. \`1\`. - \`UNSPECIFIED_STATE\`: Состояние покупки не определено. Конкретное значение не предоставлено в этом фрагменте, но предыдущие стандарты указывали на \`0\`.

Для получения более точной информации необходимо проверить официальную документацию Google Play Billing Library или экземпляры исходного кода, чтобы увидеть, какие они присваивают значения для \`UNSPECIFIED_STATE\`. Похоже, что ваше предположение о том, что в данной версии библиотеки значение \`2\` может означать успешную покупку, не подтверждается, так как \`2\` означает состояние ожидания (\`PENDING\`). И наоборот, значение \`1\` теперь свидетельствует о том, что покупка была успешно совершена (\`PURCHASED\`)."},{"instruction":"Понял.

Если условие проверки \`purchaseState == 4\` истинно, и метод возращает \`2\`, на основании стандартных значений, это может означать, что платеж находится в статусе ожидания (\`PENDING\`). Но поскольку значение \`4\` не ясно из стандартной документации, возможно оно имеет особое значение, добавленное разработчиками конкретного приложения.

Если вы изменили Smali код и встроили его обратно в приложение, вам нужно будет убедиться, что приложение правильно обрабатывает статус \\"покупка успешно совершена\\" во всех сценариях использования, так как фактическое состояние покупок уже не будет проверяться. Обратите внимание, что внесение изменений в Smali код и последующая сборка приложения могут повлечь нарушение подписи приложения и потребуют повторной подписи с вашим ключом. Кроме того, подобные изменения в биллинговую логику могут нарушать политику использования сервисов Google Play и потенциально привести к санкциям со стороны Google, включая удаление приложения из магазина.

Ещё хочу понять где и что нужно найти в Smali в файлах classes.dex чтобы мне указать конкретнуб валюту например корейскую.","output":"Для указания валюты в классе, который обрабатывает покупки через Google Play Billing API, обычно используются объекты \`SkuDetails\`, которые содержат всю необходимую информацию о продукте, включая его цену и валюту. Валюта определяется на стороне Google Play и устанавливается в настройках продукта (SKU) в консоли разработчика Google Play. Это означает, что в приложении валюта не \\"указывается\\" напрямую, но получается из информации, предоставленной Google Play. Если вам нужно внести корректировки в Smali код для работы с определенной валютой, предположительно, вам нужно будет найти код, который обрабатывает \`SkuDetails\`, и изменить его таким образом, чтобы он фильтровал \`SkuDetails\` по определенной валюте. Однако, как я уже упоминал, валюта устанавливается в консоли разработчика и не задаётся программно в коде приложения. Чтобы искать места в Smali коде, где \`SkuDetails\` могут быть обработаны, вам нужно будет выполнить следующие шаги: 1. Открыть Smali файлы из вашего classes.dex, используя декомпилятор или редактор Smali кода. 2. Найти классы и методы, которые взаимодействуют с \`SkuDetails\`. Учитывая, что библиотека биллинга принимает результаты в виде JSON ответов от Google Play, вы можете поискать строки, которые содержат ключи JSON объектов, связанных со SkuDetails, например \`\\"price\\"\`, \`\\"price_currency_code\\"\`, и так далее. 3. Изучить код, чтобы определить, как обрабатывается информация о валюте. Выполнять такие изменения следует аккуратно, потому что они могут привести к нештатному поведению приложения и нарушениям в его интерактивности с Google Play Billing Services. Пожалуйста, помните, что взаимодействие с системами биллинга очень регулируемый процесс, и любые изменения, влияющие на транзакции и отображение цен, должны соответствовать политике Google и законодательству ваших целевых рынков. Более того, изменение Smali кода без понимания точной логики взаимодействия классов и методов может привести к непредвиденным результатам и ошибкам в приложении.

Валюта транзакций обычно определяется настройками Google Play Console для вашего приложения или настроек правил ценообразования для SKU, и не должна изменяться на уровне кода приложения. Вот шаги, которые вы должны выполнить для корректной работы с валютой в Google Play: 1. **Проверьте Google Play Console:** в консоли разработчика Google Play в разделе, где вы управляете товарными позициями (SKUs) для внутриигровых покупок и подписок, вы устанавливаете цены и валюту. Для каждого SKU вы указываете базовую цену и выбираете валюту; Google затем автоматически конвертирует эту цену в другие валюты на основе текущих обменных курсов. 2. **Проверьте настройки региональные:** убедитесь, что ваши SKU доступны в нужных вам странах и установлены правильные цены для этих регионов. 3. **Проверьте настройки аккаунта пользователя:** в случае если пользователь видит цены только в определенной валюте, убедитесь, что это не связано с настройками его аккаунта Google Play или местоположением. Помните, что любые изменения на уровне \`classes.dex\` могут привести к нарушению целостности приложения и политики Google Play, и если приложение обнаруживает изменения в коде, это может привести к ошибкам в работе или блокировке. Если задача состоит в локализации цен и валют, это решается на уровне Google Play Console и внутренних настроек приложения, а не изменением скомпилированного байткода. Если же вам кажется, что проблема все же связана с кодом вашего приложения, вероятнее всего, потребуется изучение исходных файлов Java/Kotlin, а не Smali, чтобы найти и понять логику взаимодействия приложения с биллинговым API и решить проблему на этом уровне."},{"instruction":"А разве нет в документации каких-то response кодов валют или что-то в этом роде. Какая-то же проверка или переменные в коде могут быть. У меня консоль некорректно отображается просто.

В частности, есть метод \`getPriceCurrencyCode()\`, который возвращает строку с кодом валюты в формате ISO 4217 для цены SKU. Однако, сам код валюты не представляет собой response код, а просто информацию о том, в какой валюте указана цена. Если вы имеете доступ к исходному коду приложения, поиск переменной, содержащей строку с кодом валюты (например, \\"KRW\\" для корейских вон), может быть выполнен, но только в том случае, если приложение по каким-то причинам самостоятельно управляет отображением валюты, что не является типичным поведением — обычно валюта устанавливается и подтягивается из API Google Play на основе данных консоли разработчика. Если вы не можете нормально использовать консоль разработчика Google Play из-за проблем с отображением, попробуйте следующее: 1. Очистите кеш браузера или воспользуйтесь режимом Инкогнито/Приватного доступа. 2. Попробуйте использовать другой браузер. 3. Убедитесь, что у вас нет проблем с интернет-соединением, которые могут влиять на загрузку страницы. 4. Проверьте, нет ли у вас расширений браузера, которые могли бы конфликтовать с консолью разработчика. 5. Свяжитесь со службой поддержки Google Play для разработчиков, если проблема сохраняется. Главное помнить, что взаимодействие приложения с Google Play Billing API должно быть корректно реализовано в исходном коде приложения. Изменения на уровне файла classes.dex без полного понимания того, что конкретно вы меняете и как это связано со структурой кода, могут привести к поломкам функционала, нарушениям работы сервиса и другим серьезным проблемам.

Можно ли это сделать а главное как конкретно","output":"В теории, вы можете изменять файл \`classes.dex\` для тестовых целей, чтобы внести определенные изменения в логику приложения, но важно понимать, что это рискованно и может привести к нестабильной работе приложения. Вот некоторые сценарии, в которых вы можете изменить \`classes.dex\`: 1. **Отладка и испытание**: Для быстрой проверки изменений в логике без необходимости перекомпилировать весь проект на Java/Kotlin. 2. **Обучение и эксперименты**: Чтобы лучше понять, как работает байт-код Dalvik и Smali, вы можете экспериментировать с модификацией уже существующих методов. 3. **Обход проблем**: Если у вас есть временные ограничения и нет доступа к исходному коду приложения, вы можете временно изменить \`classes.dex\` для обхода конкретного бага или проблемы. Тем не менее, вам следует избегать внесения любых изменений в биллинговую логику или другие важные компоненты приложения, так как это может привести к нарушению соглашения разработчика Google Play и вызвать отклонение приложения или даже удаление вашего аккаунта разработчика. **Как изменить \`classes.dex\`:** 1. **Используйте декомпилятор**: Используйте инструменты, такие как apktool, для декомпиляции APK-файла и извлечения \`classes.dex\` в Smali код. 2. **Редактируйте Smali код**: Отредактируйте Smali код, например, чтобы вернуть фиктивные данные вместо реального вызова API. Smali — достаточно низкоуровневый язык, поэтому требуется понимание виртуальной машины Dalvik и ее инструкций. 3. **Перекомпилируйте и подпишите APK**: После внесения изменений, вам нужно снова скомпилировать APK, используя apktool или аналогичные инструменты, и подписать его, так как все приложения на Android должны быть подписаны цифровой подписью. **Тестирование изменений**: - **Проверка логики приложения**: Запустите приложение и протестируйте изменения, чтобы убедиться, что они работают как задумано. **Важные предупреждения**: - Не распространяйте измененные APK файлы, особенно если они содержат изменения, касающиеся билинговых операций. - Внимательно определите свои юридические и этические границы перед любыми манипуляциями с APK. - При работе с биллинговой валютой учтите, что валидность данных о ценах и валюте должна проверяться на стороне сервера. **На практике**: Изменение классов в \`classes.dex\` без понимания реальной бизнес-логики приложения и его взаимодействия с сервером может привести к несоответствию данных и некорректной работе. Если вам нужно тестировать различные валюты или обрабатывать платежи в разных валютах, правильный подход заключается в использовании механизма тестирования покупок в Google Play Console (такого как \\"лицензированные тестировщики\\" и \\"тестирование на стадии разработки\\"), который позволяет имитировать покупки без реальных финансовых операций."},{"instruction":"Да это я понял. Просто мне сейчас для теста можно было бы убрать вообще это или чтобы с любой валютой работал вот и всё. Чем разбираться почему не работает консоль.","output":"Понял вас. Давайте уточним, что внесение изменений в Smali код с целью \\"отключения\\" проверки валюты или \\"заставления\\" приложения работать с любой валютой, может быть непростой задачей и, скорее всего, не устранило бы корень проблемы. Теоретически такие изменения могли бы привести к дырам в безопасности или другим непредвиденным проблемам. Тем не менее, если дело в тестировании функций приложения без учета определенной валюты, вам нужно было бы найти точку, в которой приложение проверяет код валюты, и изменить его таким образом, чтобы эта проверка игнорировалась или всегда возвращала успешный результат. Делать это нужно с осторожностью и только для локальных тестовых целей. Для модификации кода вам нужно выполнить следующие шаги: 1. Декомпилировать APK файл с помощью инструментов вроде \`apktool\`. 2. Найти Smali файлы, относящиеся к биллинговой логике. Особый интерес представят вызовы методов, которые на что-то реагируют в зависимости от кода валюты, например \`getPriceCurrencyCode()\` в \`SkuDetails\`. 3. Отредактировать соответствующие Smali файлы, чтобы удалить или стандартизировать возврат валюты в коде. 4. Заново собрать APK, подписать и установить его на устройства для тестирования. Помните, что вмешательство в биллинговый процесс может привести к нарушениям политик Google и является нежелательным для любой продукции, которая будет выпущена в реальную эксплуатацию. Есть и другой вариант для тестирования - использовать режим песочницы для разработчиков (sandbox mode), где можно тестировать покупки без реальных транзакций. Для этого зарегистрируйте тестовый аккаунт в консоли Google Play Console и проведите тестовые покупки напрямую из приложения. Если проблема не с тестированием, а именно с отображением настроек консоли разработчика Google Play, наиболее рациональным решением было бы обратиться в службу поддержки Google или решить проблему с отображением консоли, так как корректные настройки валют в консоли являются ключевыми для работы биллинга в приложении."},{"instruction":"1.AMENDMENTS TO AGREEMENT翻译","output":"\\"Amendments to Agreement\\" 翻译为 \\"协议修正\\" 或 \\"协议修改\\"。"},{"instruction":"The Aim 2.3 “In vitro and in vivo validation of candidate genes” in the Research Plan of the Agreement shall be fully deleted.

Если это выдуманное, специальное или игровое слово, мне необходим контекст, чтобы понять его значение и определить, к какому животному, рыбе, птице или насекомому оно могло бы подойти. Если вы можете уточнить значение слова или предоставить контекст, в котором оно используется, я постараюсь ответить на ваш вопрос более точно. Если это означает \\"усердное\\" или \\"хитрое\\", я могу предположить: 1. Самое усердное животное: Можно упомянуть муравья или пчел, учитывая их соревновательную социальную структуру и непрерывную работу. 2. Самое хитрое животное: Часто лисицы ассоциируются с хитростью в различных культурах. 3. Самое усердное и хитрое насекомое: Пчелы являются кандидатом из-за их усердия в опылении и производстве меда, а также у них есть сложные коммуникативные способности и поведение, которое можно воспринимать как хитрость. 4. Самая хитрая рыба: Осьминоги не рыбы, но многие из них живут в воде и известны своими изумительными способностями камуфляжа и решению задач, их иногда называют хитрыми. 5. Самая усердная птица: Птицы попугая известны своей способностью к обучению и социальному взаимодействию, а также бывают очень усердными при обучении командам и трюкам.

Самая \\"zelus\\" птица: Ястребы или соколы, которые известны своим острым зрением и рвением в охоте. 4. Самое \\"zelus\\" насекомое: К примеру, оса-тарантуловка, которая охотится на пауков и использует их в качестве живой пищи для своих личинок, демонстрируя весьма решительную и усердную охотничью стратегию.

Сурикаты: Невероятно социальные животные, которые усердно работают вместе для обеспечения безопасности и выживания своей группы. 3. Львы: Своей скоординированной групповой охотой и защитой своей территории проявляют сильное усердие. 4. Бобры: Известны своим усердием в строительстве сложных дамб и управлении водными ресурсами своих мест обитания. Вороны на самом деле тоже могут быть кандидатами на звание усердного или \\"zelus\\" животного. Они известны своими когнитивными способностями, которые включают в себя использование инструментов, планирование на будущее и сложное общение. Вороны также могут проявлять высокую степень адаптивности и находчивости. Если вы спрашиваете, почему вороны не подходят, это могло быть из-за представления о том, что рвение и усердие связаны с физической активностью, охотой или настойчивостью. Тем не менее, в действительности, вороны могут считаться одними из самых умных и усердных птиц.

Однако, если рассматривать \\"zelus\\" как символ страсти, усердия и рвения, мы можем попытаться выделить некоторых представителей, которые проявляют эти качества в своих соответствующих средах: 1. Наземные животные: Африканские слоны могут выделяться из-за их усердия в долгих миграциях и поисках воды, а также из-за защиты своих молодых и других членов стада. 2. Подземные животные: Кроты усердно копают сложные системы туннелей под землей в поисках пищи и для зимовки. 3. Подводные животные: Белые акулы проявляют усердие и рвение в процессе охоты, где они используют свои острые чувства и мощные тела, чтобы эффективно охотиться на добычу в открытом океане. Следует отметить, что у каждого животного есть свои уникальные качества и подходы к выживанию, которые делают его эффективным в своей собственной среде.

Также определенные виды ворон (особенно новокаледонская ворона) обладают сложными навыками по созданию и использованию инструментов. Они могут формировать ветки и листья в \\"крючки\\" и \\"шпатели\\" для извлечения насекомых из узких щелей.

En imagerie par résonance magnétique (IRM), lorsque la bande passante augmente, le rapport signal sur bruit (Signal-to-Noise Ratio, SNR) a généralement tendance à diminuer car le système reçoit plus de bruit fréquentiel. 2. Les transformations nucléaires obéissent toujours aux lois suivantes: d) conservation de l'énergie. En outre, elles obéissent également à la conservation du nombre de charge (Z, nombre de protons) et du nombre de masse (A, nombre total de nucléons : protons + neutrons). La masse elle-même n'est pas toujours conservée, car elle peut être convertie en énergie selon la relation d'Einstein E=mc². 3. Plus un noyau est stable: c) Plus son énergie de liaison par nucléon est grande. Cette énergie de liaison par nucléon est un indicateur de la stabilité nucléaire : plus elle est élevée, plus le noyau est lié fortement et donc plus stable. 4. Lors d'une réaction de fusion: c) deux noyaux légers forment un noyau plus lourd. d) il y a émission de l'énergie. La fusion nucléaire libère de l'énergie en formant un noyau plus lourd à partir de noyaux plus légers. 5.

La demi-vie est le temps nécessaire pour que la moitié de la substance radioactive se désintègre. Après deux demi-vies, il reste un quart de la substance initiale. 6. En radiologie interventionnelle, pour diminuer l'exposition de l'opérateur il faut: C. Être le plus éloigné possible du couple tube-détecteur. En se tenant plus loin, l'opérateur réduit son exposition aux radiations dispersées. D. Utiliser une filtration additionnelle.
